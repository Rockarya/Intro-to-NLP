resumption of the session    2.550836440705554
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday 17 december 1999 , and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period .    2.7189239974540875
although , as you will have seen , the UNK ' millennium UNK ' failed to materialise , still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful .    2.997746130692395
you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days , during this part - session .    3.0981595930333707
in the meantime , i should like to observe a minute ' s silence , as a number of members have requested , on behalf of all the victims concerned , particularly those of the terrible storms , in the various countries of the european union .    3.4462136105934884
please rise , then , for this minute ' s silence .    3.2190437432979477
( the house rose and observed a minute ' s silence )    1.9283240791681273
madam president , on a point of order .    2.229708564340412
you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb UNK and killings in sri lanka .    2.857320527123759
one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr UNK UNK , who had visited the european parliament just a few months ago .    3.159379057196902
would it be appropriate for you , madam president , to write a letter to the sri UNK president expressing parliament ' s regret at his and the other violent deaths in sri lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ?    2.6322432525951265
yes , mr evans , i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .    2.881686605976902
if the house agrees , i shall do as mr evans has suggested .    2.567094046563877
madam president , on a point of order .    2.229708564340412
i would like your advice about rule UNK concerning UNK .    2.1914453873258766
my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again .    2.653121971821214
it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .    3.172112066171025
i believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to UNK it would be legally inadmissible .    3.413326038188068
i want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something i can competently do on thursday .    2.886206160842186
that is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i . e . on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .    3.017090478490171
madam president , coinciding with this year ' s first part - session of the european parliament , a date has been set , unfortunately for next thursday , in texas in america , for the execution of a young 34 year - old man who has been sentenced to death . we shall call him mr UNK .    2.4121946261938287
at the request of a french member , mr UNK , a petition has already been presented , which many people signed , including myself .    2.8538131186023437
however , i would ask you , in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the european parliament and by the whole of the european community , to make representations , using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent , to the president and to the governor of texas , mr UNK , who has the power to order a stay of execution and to UNK the condemned person .    3.342272788312906
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld .    3.5731190265787576
thank you , mr UNK , i shall do so UNK .    3.0818771527266793
madam president , i should like to draw your attention to a case in which this parliament has consistently shown an interest .    2.7894487256416767
it is the case of alexander nikitin .    3.2503400422071254
all of us here are pleased that the courts have UNK him and made it clear that in russia , too , access to environmental information is a constitutional right .    2.8268038986217707
now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is UNK .    3.2596564473941387
we know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part - session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for alexander nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings .    2.7267033131005016
these findings form the basis of the european programmes to protect the UNK sea , and that is why i would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make parliament ' s position , as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted , clear as far as russia is concerned .    3.344764617418688
yes , mrs schroedter , i shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when i have received your letter .    3.0509514206710344
madam president , i would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that , during this first part - session of the new year , the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably .    3.02617045038821
but , madam president , my personal request has not been met .    3.546673443877423
although there are now two finnish channels and one portuguese one , there is still no dutch channel , which is what i had requested because dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month .    2.6514687342252974
i would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well .    3.0205763553083824
mrs plooij - van gorsel , i can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the quaestors ' meeting on wednesday .    2.803037716373705
it will , i hope , be examined in a positive light .    2.9264738919104882
madam president , can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ?    2.5887166487449407
why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ?    2.2266518134824445
why has there been no health and safety committee meeting since 1998 ?    2.231617267401302
why has there been no fire UNK , either in the brussels parliament buildings or the strasbourg parliament buildings ?    2.1271078644797408
why are there no fire instructions ?    2.519194524669201
why have the UNK not been improved since my accident ?    2.58117581447338
why are no - smoking areas not enforced ?    2.3419523039567745
it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .    2.413980886547992
mrs lynne , you are quite right and i shall check whether this has actually not been done .    2.8971446954351583
i shall also refer the matter to the college of quaestors , and i am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on .    3.0728548897660133
madam president , mrs díez gonzález and i had tabled questions on certain opinions of the vice - president , mrs de palacio , which appeared in a spanish newspaper .    2.3639361980888123
the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part - session .    2.5260214751599817
i would ask that they reconsider , since this is not the case .    2.857217633074266
the questions answered previously referred to mrs de palacio ' s intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comments which appeared in the UNK newspaper on 18 november .    2.5814587142672276
mr berenguer UNK , we shall check all this .    3.3218762252513425
i admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .    3.068229628357374
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be .    3.04976192837229
madam president , i should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from parliament this week about our UNK over today ' s decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on indonesia , considering that the vast majority in this parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in indonesia in the past ?    2.618562855527357
today ' s decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .    2.715868523848046
so parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .    2.9000897294311807
it is irresponsible of eu member states to refuse to renew the embargo .    3.008627877126631
as people have said , the situation there is extremely UNK .    3.709448265110155
we do not know what is happening .    3.017319956601856
so why should eu arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people ?    2.2463692684145253
in any event , this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday .    2.2392638914754937
agenda    3.614422713529094
the next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 13 january pursuant to rule 110 of the rules of procedure .    2.015629835050913
no amendments have been proposed relating to monday and tuesday .    2.6341197137567374
relating to wednesday :    2.8991603824468153
the group of the party of european socialists requests that a commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the commission .    2.6027606861880117
i would like mr barón crespo , who made the request , to speak to propose it . that is , if he so wishes , of course .    2.910733787256311
then we shall follow the usual procedure , hearing one speaker in favour and one against .    2.0778139316247066
madam president , the presentation of the prodi commission ' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the group of the party of european socialists which was unanimously approved by the conference of presidents in september and which was also explicitly accepted by president prodi , who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech .    2.647951409053226
this commitment is important because the commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the treaties and , therefore , basically dictates this parliament ' s political and legislative activity for the next five years .    2.9833126642593375
i would also like to point out , madam president , that this parliament voted to express its confidence in president prodi during the previous legislature . it did so again during this legislature , in july , and then , in september , it voted once more to approve the whole commission .    2.696842668128196
there has therefore been enough time for the commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens .    3.0656601028881543
to this end , i would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 september , which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible .    2.6180778786136054
the events of last week - which UNK outside the conference of presidents , that conference being used simply to UNK and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma . either the commission is not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .    2.4819648585272565
according to its president , it is in a position to do so .    3.372383774534703
given that the commission is represented by vice - president de palacio , i believe that , before voting , it would help if the commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme , as agreed . alternatively , parliament is not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggesting .    3.270140223990793
in my opinion , this second hypothesis would imply the failure of parliament in its duty as a parliament , as well as introducing an original UNK , an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware , in writing , of a speech concerning the commission ' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier , as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in february , so we could UNK the debate , since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the internet and parliament will no longer have to worry about it .    2.676477482439341
my group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen , debate and reflect , there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that , if the commission is ready to do so , we still have time to re - establish the original agreement between parliament and the commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens .    2.9267226747784916
therefore , the proposal of the group of the party of european socialists , and which you have mentioned , is that the prodi commission present its legislative programme on wednesday , including its proposed administrative reform , because , otherwise , we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation : on the pretext that there is no text , on the one hand , the president of the commission would be denied his right to speak in this parliament and , on the other hand , there would be a debate on a reform when parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based .    3.2505111350471867
therefore , madam president , i would ask you to request that the commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .    3.4550533710290097
( applause from the pse group )    2.3025396186211906
madam president , i would like to make it very clear that , above all , the commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this parliament and , amongst those , the decision establishing its agenda .    3.2191415470465836
we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide .    2.317511764346584
but i would also like to make it very clear that president prodi made a commitment to this parliament to introduce a new debate , as mr barón crespo has reminded us , which would be in addition to the annual debate on the commission ' s legislative programme , on the broad areas of action for the next five years , that is to say , for this legislature .    3.6110765299943792
i would also like to say that the commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally , on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups .    2.9199160727551865
i propose that we vote on the request of the group of the party of european socialists that the commission statement on its strategic objectives should be UNK .    2.9568740813749708
( parliament rejected the request ) president .    2.3043463957865815
still on the subject of wednesday ' s sitting , i have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax .    3.1316988043931766
the ppe - de group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda .    2.4078525054594335
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this ?    2.440263448632175
i do not know whether this information is correct , but the ppe - de group would , in any case , be grateful if this item were removed because parliament has addressed this issue several times already .    2.4985215484653076
decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .    2.9164077191005884
thank you , mr poettering .    2.545881133260028
we shall now hear mr wurtz speaking against this request .    2.2303773799966704
madam president , i would firstly like to point out mr poettering ' s lack of logic .    2.362624671045646
we discussed that matter and we were unanimous , with the exception of the ppe and eldr groups . as my fellow chairmen will recall , i even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the tobin tax , but of whether one dared to hear what the commission and the council thought of it .    2.7014125003034533
it is not a lot to ask .    3.031545318561157
i therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the commission and the council should be retained so that we can find out , once and for all , the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion , particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the seattle conference .    2.7258951925769765
we shall proceed to vote on the ppe - de group ' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda .    2.577789395940111
( parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes for , UNK votes against and 7 abstentions )    2.038593235424038
madam president , i would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate .    2.2691475572389943
thank you very much .    2.353503084677091
madam president , has my vote been counted ? i was unable to vote UNK , since i do not have a card .    2.596646866070521
my vote was " in favour " .    2.4995093922419622
madam president , the presidency has already declared the result of the vote .    3.403795083894524
there is no room for amendments .    2.7432848480003282
madam president , in the earlier vote - and i will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the commission i indicated that i would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my group .    3.7827041744610663
that did not happen .    3.0737314251088987
i would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , i might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my group .    3.0341049878847572
it would be useful for the record of the house to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis .    3.05779245812308
madam president , i do not wish to reopen the debate , but i had also asked for the floor , to comment on mr barón crespo ' s motion .    2.8832141780567864
you did not call me either .    2.622611476610693
i regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there .    2.979101104191956
even so , i think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the minutes .    2.753566744029663
when we adopt the minutes for today ' s sitting tomorrow , then any members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments .    2.5343389341673563
this seems to me to be a workable solution .    3.2719535330563345
of course , the minutes for tomorrow ' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations .    2.8377811816635137
i think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time - consuming explanations of votes .    2.468471908630103
mr cox , mr hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ?    2.374694135094409
if your ruling is that i cannot give an explanation of vote , i accept that but with reservations .    2.7426899727039977
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the minutes , as we always do , of course .    3.42548824641477
if they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .    2.734222388493874
( the order of business was adopted thus amended )    2.469287057590621
safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods    2.903306332597329
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0105 / 1999 ) by mr koch , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the common position adopted by the council with a view to adopting a european parliament and council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterways ( c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1998 / UNK ( cod ) .    2.1626359954182703
commissioner , madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i can be quite frank in saying that i welcome the council ' s common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterway .    2.5219634074580464
firstly , we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of directive 96 / 35 / ec , which obliges the member states to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training , UNK and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly .    2.713535190432977
secondly , by adopting this directive we achieve a ) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and UNK ; b ) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c ) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the european labour market .    2.134638472167005
thirdly , this directive , as it currently stands in the common position , guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the european union ; by adopting it we contribute to the member states ' bearing a high level of individual responsibility .    2.7438761058528964
all of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed .    3.518944290494856
our amendments from the first reading have , i believe , been taken into account very satisfactorily .    3.464088975221565
they have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance , or they have been rejected because the corresponding european arrangements have not been included , for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions .    2.5732446722093445
the one unanimously adopted amendment of the committee on regional policy and transport , which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive , is something which i would urge you to support .    3.4602805441826625
by not setting a specific date for the member states to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force , we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay .    3.0609923533795373
i would urge you to endorse this .    2.668652648685423
madam president , we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads , but also on our railways and waterways , not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster .    2.4791861595125124
as an austrian , i still have a vivid memory , as , i believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the UNK tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense .    2.4684921105246582
the renovation project , which lasted for months , cut off this important route between the north and south of europe .    2.207908048191619
the traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the eu to the limit .    2.8973766254856272
in fact , all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province .    2.102423613735313
prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well - trained safety advisers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time .    2.9326783894321395
all the same , we must not content ourselves with enacting european law to ensure greater safety .    2.901973815576119
we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the member states in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards .    3.125513057115044
please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to UNK the lack of enforcement .    2.750791434866134
i should like to address one final point . we must not content ourselves with UNK another hole in the safety net and UNK our eyes to the fact that , where transport safety in europe is concerned , there is still much more to be done .    2.9909583250120138
in this context , i should like to make a request and ask the commissioner responsible , who is with us here today , to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future , so that we in europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale .    3.144201642032753
madam president , first of all i should like to thank mr koch for his report which has , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .    3.0534122061684887
i congratulate him on his excellent report .    2.7587003760099926
transport safety has sadly been in the news recently : the paddington rail crash in london , the terrible rail crash in norway , the two UNK UNK involving eu citizens and the natural disaster involving the erika off brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified .    2.089796528738202
the rapporteur has pointed out to the house that in its common position the council has accepted six of parliament ' s ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of parliament ' s other amendments has been retained .    3.332955289403137
my group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the european union as safe as possible .    2.7254846228792537
when it comes to safety my group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .    2.2712715905055716
madam president , i would like to make a few comments .    2.489740299930408
i would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the commission for the proposal it has submitted .    3.5362731521567956
we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .    2.755508989287651
this is a pity , in a sense .    3.2690732756168543
needless to say , safety on roads , railways and inland waterways is of key importance and , given the international nature of these types of transport , training for safety advisors should also be harmonised , therefore , as well as the requirements of the new adr , for example , which is under way .    3.011070485168006
this is important , but so is enforcement and there are , of course , a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this .    3.847777282961325
just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years , for example in belgium , the netherlands and a number of other countries where UNK carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in UNK conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead .    2.603737218449234
or ships from eastern europe which UNK adjacent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .    2.2868325247790797
furthermore , it has UNK that research in the ports in belgium , finland , but also in japan has shown that 50 % of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for UNK .    2.5974712494816536
in short , the issue is an important one .    3.2154464304805983
if we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned , in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 january of this year .    2.818901932034004
there will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present , especially with smaller companies , as these cannot afford safety advisors .    2.3826777561754966
these smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .    1.937415843832591
it is therefore also being requested that UNK UNK certificates possibly include the UNK details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses .    2.2984866548869425
the work is done . all that remains is the business of enforcement .    2.7640816343863857
i would like to mention one final point .    2.583264750702676
with regard to enforcement , proper agreements must also be concluded with the eastern european countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 july 2001 , that is to say in eighteen months ' time .    2.5588532568137516
this gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .    2.2652939036454445
this is not in itself anything dreadful , but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road , rail and inland waterways and incorporate these , as part of the acquis communautaire , as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states .    2.515618279162599
madam president , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this parliament and rightly so .    2.886472993093106
the ever increasing volume of goods passing through europe entails all kinds of risks , known and unknown , for employees and the social environment .    2.0909648771080493
the relevant standards which have been laid down in another directive , 95 / 35 / ec , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods .    2.406735875247761
i am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the council on minimum standards regarding examinations , although i would have preferred it if uniform , set standards and UNK had been established , so that certificates would be of equal value internationally .    2.576208262569641
this , however , does not seem feasible .    3.4545341215199
finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and i can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support .    3.027113840493203
mr president , commissioner , i should first like to congratulate mr koch on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety .    2.1825955995368456
i should like to make just a few comments .    2.9730749590394874
firstly , i should like to ask the commissioner - and i am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety , be it on the roads , on the waterways or at sea .    3.1052631893003344
considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a commission proposal first made on 19 march 1998 , even though parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .    2.8994945693246983
this is not just the fault of the commission , but i believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .    3.7309679724730276
my second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .    2.8495731332469934
in principle , i believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country - specific rules .    3.0318988043200417
however , when it comes to safety , i am rather sceptical because safety in sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in germany , italy or austria .    2.774651571138787
i can live with these minimum standards , but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully .    3.156803941480063
my third point has also been mentioned already .    2.9147074527439125
as you know , like mr rack , i come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .    2.2976974269732953
we do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as austria or other transit countries .    2.6106775131588047
but i believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not .    3.197160304215668
mr president , i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr koch , on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal ; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the UNK examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterway .    2.5755904235377205
we understand that it is important that the two institutions - parliament and commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the committee on regional policy , and in particular the transport group , is magnificent .    3.53854304063222
very briefly , i would like to thank the various members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the commission ' s priorities in the field of transport .    3.460519645982301
as mr UNK has said very correctly , this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end .    2.9652035984323666
the process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day .    2.5665274216711405
in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .    2.5256779937117115
UNK and a few kilos of paint which , in principle , do not present risks , led to a genuine disaster .    3.0319278581803855
therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .    2.980901372736683
this week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport .    3.6578440340921996
but i would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the commission .    3.255069713748919
as i will say in the debate on the erika disaster , we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem .    3.414035053173493
i would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , mr koch .    2.92497785267683
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.6677986406930794
transport of dangerous goods by road    3.2391733039942
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0104 / 1999 ) by mr koch , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 94 / 55 / ec on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [ com ( 1999 ) 158 - c5 - 0004 / 1999 - 1999 / 0083 ( cod ) ] .    2.0396896156402233
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered into force on 1 january 1997 , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the cen , that is the european committee for standardisation .    2.5019620955127224
delays in the cen ' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive .    3.016914501018917
in particular , annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments .    2.4977754469641873
i regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .    3.0251806632775553
in this respect , i accept this proposal to amend directive 94 / 55 / ec which has been tabled for discussion today .    2.5869429646424447
the amendment to the directive on today ' s agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the community .    2.794901467834084
the amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the member states obtain more powers .    3.163595404004943
the commission decides whether the member states may impose certain rules of their own . in so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure .    3.04137502726343
the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the commission were laid down UNK in the council decision of june 1999 .    3.144415928186669
the proposal to be discussed today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road , dates from may 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure .    2.921030070771197
two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure .    2.8610393908364937
we would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months .    3.614368143105029
in addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .    2.942825724684774
a further amendment allows the member states to impose more stringent requirements , in particular for vacuum tanks , if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below - 20ºc . this is in the special interest of northern european regions .    2.5401260067716778
a final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 january 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it .    2.953593996538333
i do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but i would ask you to endorse this report .    3.1412783970177487
mr president , colleagues , a happy new year and millennium to you all .    2.3387470063594233
i am speaking for the first time in this plenary part - session , so this is quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that did last longer than two minutes .    2.521189058828253
i would like to briefly comment on the commission ' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .    2.8680481138641643
it is good that this directive should be established now , as , otherwise , member states would have to amend their national acts for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to eu bureaucracy .    2.8711573020767718
the commission ' s proposal , however , does not take account of all the facts , such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions .    3.3662371971472167
consequently , i have tabled some amendments to mr koch ' s intrinsically excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .    3.1011084581736568
according to the commission ' s proposal - 20ºc would have been sufficient . on the shores of the mediterranean , it is hard to imagine that in lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that .    2.8685968427528943
there is support for the eu in lapland also , so let us remember them .    3.0402264665341114
this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .    2.603182265272689
i hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow ' s vote .    2.82115119614896
mr president , with your permission i should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the UNK just now during the debate .    2.63581329750376
i thought that it was quite superb .    3.115643275308402
on the subject at hand , i think that the people of europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on europe ' s roads , railways , and so on are as safe as possible .    2.872426954753464
this directive is a contribution to this .    3.1872891736095808
what we are doing today is essentially a nuisance .    2.689439728684852
the rapporteur , mr koch , to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this , has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the UNK on the part of the cen , which has been very UNK in drawing up and adapting the directive .    3.270086045117949
that is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that , in 2001 , we will finally have community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer .    3.1016470619447616
mr president , the report we are discussing here does not , in itself , entail any major changes .    2.9380637636916678
most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature .    2.9840976703705477
it is nonetheless worth emphasising that , each time we make this type of decision , it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market .    2.5789691326019524
very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the eu , both on roads and railways and by sea .    2.7225800024350244
this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind .    2.561729113312723
in area after area , we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the member states .    3.0628805871911626
this is extraordinarily positive , and there is cause to thank the rapporteur , mr koch , for the work he has put in on this issue .    3.206564049131658
this is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned .    2.922809120740702
if we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running , it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also , as far as possible , apply to every country .    3.010413917830032
i should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance , namely an amendment tabled by member of parliament , mr UNK vatanen .    2.724712345684642
in many ways , the prerequisites differ from one member state to another .    2.6057599125189546
by approving this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the european union .    3.377820568991269
this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind .    2.541966773294052
it is good that , in establishing the present regulations , we can also be flexible .    3.409966566627577
i hope that the commission is able to accept the present amendment .    3.083878444092504
mr president , i would like to thank not only mr koch , but also the vice - president of the commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority .    2.9892693776506793
the reason mr koch produced his sound report was because the work in the cen and within the united nations economic commission was proceeding none too expeditiously .    2.4831529250684716
i would like to ask the vice - president if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations , and whether the eu is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts , in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible .    2.7804551489691356
for one thing is clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the european union , traffic does not stop at our borders , it goes beyond them .    2.9427614989145967
hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far - reaching regional provisions .    2.452556104523454
if the commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the cen and the economic commission are at ?    2.6010748808591195
mr president , i would once again like to congratulate mr koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplements the debate which we held in october on rail transport .    2.5203333068908007
we all regret that the european committee for standardisation ( cen ) has not been able , in the required time , to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the european union .    3.0905626841642504
a moment ago , mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures , not of 20 degrees below zero , but of 40 degrees below zero .    2.3705444563661224
of course , we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and i believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the european union , which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and UNK of a technical nature .    3.2598897498627837
i would like to say , with regard to mr swoboda ' s comments on the activity of the cen , that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if , despite the new deadline , we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded .    3.0829031440720245
lastly , mr president , the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out . we have referred to the delay by the cen , the amendment of certain provisions , the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific .    3.5357197782754697
the commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , mr koch , which are contained in the various amendments , specifically four .    3.492256878995186
we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .    3.1248687121206764
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
structural funds - cohesion fund coordination    2.9738568195079154
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0108 / 1999 ) by mrs schroedter , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the communication from the commission in the field of the structural funds and their coordination with the cohesion fund : guidelines for programmes in the period 2000 - 2006 [ com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - 0122 / 1999 - 1999 / 2127 ( cos ) ] .    2.104389522915033
mr president , it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the european parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the united kingdom that i represent in this parliament , namely wales .    3.5371166357804453
a major part of wales , as you know , has been granted objective 1 status under the structural funds programme .    3.2207992772051655
it is quite clear that many people within wales are looking to the european structural funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face .    2.8820607932270255
we have seen poverty growing in wales ; and growing still further since 1997 .    2.195177633571051
we have seen the gap between rich and poor widen .    2.5816623292803813
we are looking , therefore , within the structural funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the UNK .    3.6454342332946243
what is , however , deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of structural funds assistance is something that has been , in a sense , a success of the government . it is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that wales faces .    3.2395371275704368
that is why i want to highlight some of the issues that i believe the commission must have at the forefront .    3.7597547807304625
we look to the commission to deal with points in relation to additionality .    4.230736113710181
we are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within uk figures .    3.125263688217906
we look to the commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects .    3.7479773273848105
we look to it to challenge the uk government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be providing the major impetus for structural funds expenditure , is involved in the planning stage .    2.650256670082358
finally , we ask that the commission ensures that structural fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent .    2.873797108625814
too much of what takes place within this parliament is not transparent .    3.589218831961406
this is one area in which i believe the commission can be a very great friend to wales .    3.691583591068087
mr president , our committee views these issues very differently and , to start , i will speak from the point of view of research .    2.694745843692133
we see it as a very positive sign that , in her own conclusions , the rapporteur has taken account of our committee ' s proposal that the cohesion fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by UNK universities and UNK in such a way that they would serve those who live in UNK regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts .    2.721541889693896
this will be possible with action on the part of governments , and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development .    2.579255533569547
another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , is that we would have liked the commission to pay more attention to the effects of services , electronic commerce and the growing use of the internet , when they were planning the coordination of structural funds and cohesion funds .    3.464164820076623
poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood .    2.350998156781266
the rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry , but today those areas might have become a burden , and they may well be poor , meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production , as i might call it , and the production of services , because they are the industries of the future .    2.6858337349091332
in my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this , so on behalf of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , i would draw the commission ' s attention to this issue .    2.8678355812253473
finally , as the committee representing energy , we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from cohesion and regional development funds to have been emphasised still more , thus , through a process of coordination , increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums .    2.94467176976104
mr president , i would very much like to thank mrs schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that i am speaking for my colleague , mrs flautre , who followed this for the committee on employment and social affairs but who is unfortunately ill .    2.635119262494851
i would like to draw people ' s attention to amendments nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the committee on employment and social affairs but not accepted by the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .    2.6197524867730646
these amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion .    2.7439169032048545
in the past , this parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .    2.881422420936611
these amendments also fit in with this parliament ' s view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action .    2.9450125314829343
we hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment .    2.1336666404838076
in her report , mrs flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is UNK lacking , yet desperately needed .    2.3214696667801054
the commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the european social fund .    3.287477111959806
but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking social fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000 - 2006 programme .    2.9050470975385707
it could be said that the omission gives the impression that the commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between european social fund assistance , which is subject to review after three and a half years , and the member states ' annual national plans for employment .    3.146437168320195
we hope that the commission can reassure us that this was an UNK which is now being dealt with constructively .    3.8462430374050123
mr president , commissioner , the proposal presented by the commission , in accordance with its mandate , is a reasonable starting point for the committee on agriculture and rural development .    3.125977242543712
i would like to point out , however , that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us : maintaining a population in rural areas , given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture ' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society .    2.349045469199775
the consequences do not inspire hope .    2.492545053382433
it is the young people who are disappearing , who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas , all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas .    2.7391414450760423
this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .    3.2484534698982364
we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the european union .    2.224866301422593
agriculture only provides 5 . 5 % of employment in the union .    2.9529836921127566
furthermore , three quarters of our farm workers are part - time and require supplements to their incomes .    2.2380400132797496
for this reason , one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the european union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas , outside of the agricultural sector , in sectors such as rural tourism , sport , culture , heritage conservation , the conversion of businesses , new technologies , services , etc . however , even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive , it is still essential , not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of UNK towns , but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land , in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment .    2.990281745697903
therefore , we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set . we want rural areas , at the dawn of the 21st century , to be competitive and multi - functional , both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non - agricultural activities .    3.3445928306426604
it is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the committee on agriculture and rural development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up by the committee on transport , regional policy and tourism in its points 16 and 17 .    2.8003777140216934
in conclusion , i would ask the commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because i believe that , for the european union , maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives .    3.431094289594361
mr president , commissioner , i would like to begin by thanking mrs schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work .    2.6848641506323303
i think that this work has been carried out extremely well .    2.587129814202482
i would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing .    2.6678546020406237
we feel that it is important that the commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this parliament , at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air .    3.1142275591407085
the truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the commission must take account of what is adopted by this parliament , particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives .    3.9136513277166607
in our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the structural funds , the cohesion fund and community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , in the best and most profitable way , by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are , when all is said and done , the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing .    3.1151132865848967
in order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives , we think that those who generate employment , the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment , that is , businesspeople , must participate in this initiative .    2.72198655694371
small and medium - sized businesses , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these funds .    3.380316859262684
if they do not , if businesspeople feel marginalised , if entrepreneurs cannot take part , not only in managing but also in receiving these funds , we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly .    2.743557403033754
also , in order to attain our objectives , to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment , it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies , to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies .    2.8554220509091763
all of this must be done - i repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by UNK its efforts with those of public administrations , but UNK them , never obstructing or excluding them , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs .    2.820499004180902
mr president , it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , mr evans , of why wales actually achieved objective 1 status .    2.4878971311878906
it was because of the UNK policies of his own conservative party .    3.135528694169761
let me also remind him that when his party leader , mr hague , was secretary of state for wales , he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a UNK letter from commissioner wulf - mathies regarding regulatory requirements .    2.1400689554632626
i can tell you that the british government is aware of its regulatory requirements on objective 1 additionality .    2.6167005371121124
i suggest mr evans goes back and reads the regulation .    2.3170752950323332
my group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .    2.208029556716202
i want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .    2.9077327654849148
the objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration , to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life - support machine .    2.511735322463887
it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi - tech sector .    2.5491522694302504
it is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that europe is rapidly losing ground to the us in the hi - tech growth industries of the future .    2.5284694488100006
the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about .    2.844893031828131
they should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape .    2.468087946203443
they should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development , resulting in inevitable delays and UNK , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement .    2.8339710493805255
the implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the commission or in the civil service .    3.2894220268778107
there must be an internal coherence in the commission directorate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of commission programmes .    2.5518848552880287
the conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund - users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration .    2.3959656887633316
if we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success .    2.28164809998616
this is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines : whether eu regional policy with a good , solid , enabling guideline , can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the eu .    2.3113943532613987
mr president , commissioner , i would like to thank mrs schroedter for an excellent report . she has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report .    2.676765507259848
the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .    2.3046795135889013
hopefully , the stands parliament has taken will help , however , in the mid - term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation .    3.1142282239267445
for the time , the report grew too large when it was being debated .    3.3551115545732086
it contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports .    2.2923876494279534
at this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer union regional policy , bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality .    2.9470259232466844
our group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of member states and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes .    3.2057057709591854
it is especially important to get smes involved in the planning and implementation of programmes .    2.5218565209446577
our group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas .    1.9707023298920912
we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the union and its member states exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes .    2.850560711457896
projects implemented with support from the union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes .    2.3186234884679475
funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned .    2.707849605099673
projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be made more productive .    3.795355433032051
while the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the union ' s regional policy in general .    3.4368051753015827
for us new members , it was the first time , and this was a very interesting process .    4.107987282592948
this report is very good and our group supports it .    2.92400224796782
mr president , commissioner , as proof that this parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my group , UNK schroedter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000 - 2006 for objective 1 regions have been sitting in the commission ' s offices for several months .    2.5179346908890854
bearing this in mind , this house should , in any event , demand that , before the community support frameworks for the period in question are approved , they be studied and submitted for debate in this parliament , specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today .    3.225837374704212
this is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least - developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in european society and to the move towards a fairer europe .    2.740886990826528
mr president , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the structural and cohesion funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion .    3.0178663197733413
we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results .    2.719159643019504
we are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a europe of citizens and not just in a europe of states and of regions .    4.046677523365039
we feel that the funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .    2.674684123153658
we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole UNK .    2.2975093140723777
some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population .    2.758634257425008
we will have to study several indicators , which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others , and how they are evolving .    2.922990355819154
it is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to parliament ' s plenary sitting today that europe ' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions .    2.788833239661162
this fact means that the european parliament , the commissioner and the commission must act decisively and strategically .    4.080061060467341
i agree that the european parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity , as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives .    3.873675631475413
i do not think , however , that this report has come too late .    3.134227323954618
we all agree that we should ask that , halfway through these programmes , when the assessment of the directives is made , parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens ' representatives .    3.326502754946877
our citizens cannot accept that the european union takes decisions in a way that is , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .    4.093785090440877
they need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .    3.483517941837536
this is what we are today asking the commissioner for .    3.1949989638929113
mr president , i support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the structural funds and the cohesion fund for the period 2000 - 2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following : there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of eu structural and cohesion funds .    2.8675524389945375
this means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent .    3.459721857455573
member states are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for UNK relations between towns and rural areas .    2.2284113670434293
this latter point is of particular importance .    2.5912712017723445
while urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city UNK .    2.413436698417578
we do not want to build a europe of cities alone .    3.1619442878871653
the structural funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgrading of roads , water treatment and related transport networks .    2.4564392620675544
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the eu leaders at their berlin summit last year , which were supported by parliament at its last may plenary part - session .    2.540604966084514
key eu programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and objective 1 regions within europe .    2.3861065513074515
the key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date . this would ensure that the peripheral countries and the UNK regions , the poorer regions in europe , are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone , as well as within an ever - expanding internal market where the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital exist .    2.7164482294358434
in conclusion , while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the european regional development fund and the cohesion fund , we should remember that the european social fund has played a very important role in helping the less well - off in our society .    3.400640908464248
the social fund has certainly improved our third - level institutions , financed our post - leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long - term unemployment , assist early school UNK and promote higher standards of UNK UNK .    2.0650646635646503
mr president , on numerous occasions in the past i have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues . this time , however , i actually agree with her .    2.8972839478875043
whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path , i cannot say . nevertheless , i would like to commend her on her work .    2.663333652730322
the second point i would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex , as we and mrs mccarthy , as rapporteurs for the general regulation , had asked .    2.870443891983999
unfortunately , this did not happen . mr UNK is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee .    3.107431347690759
i am raising the issue just to reiterate parliament ' s position .    2.9103687381861425
thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far .    2.7548521880581314
they are particularly beneficial to the member states , and i would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development , job creation and , more particularly , on equal opportunities and transport issues .    3.3239391743126974
personally , i at least am totally in favour of the guidelines .    2.8231300900802965
this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves . this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that i have been a member of this parliament , and i have raised the issue time and time again .    3.5677257326600036
commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the treaty of amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands .    3.3951953255736687
therefore , the commission should address the issue once and for all .    3.359621569793956
the time has come to implement the programmes , and so member states should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly .    2.746993270249788
as for us in parliament , i would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the commission and parliament which was signed in may .    3.2625005975665147
i am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that parliament will keep UNK of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes .    2.6974714911230904
mr president , commissioner , in this minute and a half i should like , first of all , to congratulate mrs schroedter .    3.338711353004226
i know many have already done so , but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides , and i think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today .    2.466014932549047
i share the regrets she expressed , namely that parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines , since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that i cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect , which in my view is a pity .    2.559024317216866
consequently , i feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid - term review in 2003 , and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003 .    2.654444272132482
in brief , i would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000 - 2006 , which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face .    3.243473958143197
the first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies .    2.7621554162021322
subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking .    2.793671495673715
we must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that union policy UNK with the subsidiary national policies for regional development ?    2.499900236940961
the second challenge is that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical terms .    2.951371278274349
finally , in this time of natural disasters , i would just like to mention the issue of the use of structural funds .    4.17513833458499
as you know , it is up to each state to redistribute part of the total appropriation .    3.294455390338938
europe should not be completely absent , as the states tend to want .    3.2333062051443733
i think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear .    2.6204325070942884
i also think we should ensure , or ask member states to ensure , that there is some publicity given to european aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents .    2.720601761007067
mr president , the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form .    2.153188278889501
as far as french planning experts are concerned , for example , the most probable scenario today is that of the UNK of regional disparities within each country .    3.475272806733331
well , the structural funds have helped to apply a brake to this process .    2.9081773390664964
our project of a europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator .    2.2165570519869306
its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the structural funds .    2.8066904644587094
what we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at european level .    2.831427291617855
the commission , however , though bound to issue guidelines , does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner .    2.6838170131486354
the report put forward today re - establishes its place in the political sphere .    2.6622780155324333
it is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .    3.2309942920236887
this is what UNK us to vote in favour of it .    2.72466797814706
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .    2.2675032264864994
over the coming years , faced with the challenges of globalisation and UNK enlargement , europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy .    2.5187616769649366
to this end , europe as a whole , and each member state individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the structural funds .    2.855331626054731
for this to be possible , what we need from the european commission are not just good intentions , but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the member states .    3.1833473190799797
for example , in recent years italy has had problems in utilising the structural funds , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level .    2.684541949650839
there are , therefore , two points to which i would like to draw the commission ' s attention . firstly , we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision - making , precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided .    3.0188762809787626
secondly , a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent , since , they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated , to the point of hindering access to the funds . this is something about which european small and medium - sized businesses , in particular , tend to complain .    2.9537426080215967
i will conclude , mr president , by saying that the failure of the commission ' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and , especially , methods of combating unemployment among women and young people , is cause for serious concern .    2.995998807675189
mr president , like my colleague mr evans , it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this house on this very important issue , especially since i represent a part of the united kingdom , the west midlands , which has hitherto benefited from objective 2 funding in particular .    3.012649807532731
but the report before the house tonight is a prime example of how , if we are not very careful , we can produce very UNK - sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them .    2.850695131918078
the report itself is well - intentioned but , as so often when we deal with these issues , lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for UNK .    2.659432080762379
that is why i and my group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text , not to take anything away from the proposal , but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide .    2.882667524982241
i would like to explain our thinking here .    2.4937739073987792
firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the structural and cohesion funds .    3.5305602070009128
past experience dictates that , as the elected representatives of the european taxpayer , we should , and indeed must , demand financial UNK and transparency in the UNK and auditing of this money , hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as " value for money " indicators in the grant - giving process .    2.8209413308119866
next , we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period .    2.425354458834209
but at the mid - way point or end of that period there is no effective way of UNK the project if it has not proved successful .    2.8261451949859975
our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable UNK strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer , but we also avoid the well - UNK syndrome of throwing good money after bad .    2.308488256136345
finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed .    2.7895572020241852
there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation .    2.3866365507329834
also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small - scale revenue - based projects , which are hard to monitor , towards capital schemes where , in the majority of cases , the benefits are there for all to see .    2.8134299220607693
that way the much - UNK need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the european parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform .    2.695347099627996
if these changes to the report are supported by the house today , i believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about , namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the european union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living , not by giving a hand - out but by giving a " hand - up " .    2.9888502251117073
i urge the house to support these changes .    2.9932689467468467
mr president , commissioner , i too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work .    2.8198160663554805
the european union ' s structural and cohesion policies are , without doubt , essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions .    2.633345676938919
despite the steps taken thus far , these levels are still very high , and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment .    2.318972911472739
these policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought - out and sensible guidelines .    2.548496586447098
let us not forget that when these policies are effective , they also benefit european citizens by directly improving their quality of life .    2.063337432266277
let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the european union because their geographical location is a UNK to their economic and social development , unless of course the commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the european mainland .    3.04598883441248
in closing , i would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium , for which we all hope for the best .    3.249171863354791
mr president , mrs schroedter ' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations , and i would like to congratulate her on that .    2.8352587484451215
however , i feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the community ' s regional policy .    3.6968355951111884
quite briefly , structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it aggravates it .    2.6426512087051517
the agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been UNK damaged by the existing regional policy , which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers , particularly in the south .    3.269176119099784
if we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report , we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities .    3.0430416435854104
little consideration , if any at all , has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the union whose shortcomings as regards UNK structure , transport , communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation .    2.889191118750781
the union ' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .    3.1839603199437194
a large section of the union ' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass - roots .    2.702173805959129
unfortunately , the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented .    3.3647003419013624
mr president , i would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the union .    2.798905993659344
the first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .    3.0718017610621335
we are concerned to hear news that the commission is taking this objective less seriously .    2.9744508425381313
we still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the union ' s fundamental objectives .    3.615654850136744
secondly , i agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and i would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention .    3.6334239760000577
in future , we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as , in my country , the islands of the azores and madeira .    3.6245024516258857
i would like to ask if the commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the commission ' s report on the outermost regions , which has been long awaited by parliament ?    3.5081547322472555
mr president , first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made .    2.5867688276829535
mr president , commissioner , the guidelines are intended to help steer the member states towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes .    2.8888300826472864
however , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the commission ' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a UNK of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas .    3.2036480363792093
nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities .    2.8157302680268272
i agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the member states on simplifying administration , and i support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour - intensive , small and medium - sized enterprises , on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing , and on start - up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields .    2.237933331797681
i am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my group to paragraph 10 , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects .    2.9294712972266654
i should be very grateful , mrs schroedter , if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations .    2.5966258264297664
mr president , commissioner , in the committee on employment and social affairs , we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the structural and cohesion funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women .    2.5662784355745782
unfortunately , the excellent schroedter report did not take account of this criterion , despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the berend report - how , in fact , these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from europe ' s most highly - developed regions .    2.7471132827979017
they are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions .    3.103300004628115
commissioner , please read the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs and treat it as a matter of priority , because this is our citizens ' greatest problem .    2.7739903466274476
please take account , in strategic terms , in the revision and in the allocation of reserves , of employment needs , because this , fundamentally is what the structural funds and the cohesion funds require .    3.15671048163035
mr president , it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven - year period 2000 - 2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation , particularly for women and young people , and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy .    2.866584121620094
it is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas , employment in rural areas , aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the european union and for the greek islands which , of course , comprise half of the islands of the union , as stipulated in article 158 of the treaty .    3.0137521458561274
cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a europe which totally UNK the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable .    2.4345183316583077
everyone understands , mrs schroedter , ladies and gentlemen , the reasons and the time limits involved - and i shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays , since we are discussing this report right now , as the representative for the commission , i consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000 - 2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming .    3.6170455415059375
mrs schroedter , you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the member states and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters , european union cofinancing of the programmes requires , and is the justification for , a situation where community priorities as debated and approved in this house should also be taken into account in order to promote this community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out .    2.9846220102423175
so , ladies and gentlemen , i should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you , mrs schroedter , and the various members of this house , have made .    3.339396072197671
regarding the role and structure of these guidelines , mr hatzidakis , mrs schroedter and mrs mccarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of structural fund objectives 1 , 2 and 3 as well as their links with the cohesion funds .    2.6631867940413474
this means putting forward the commission ' s priorities , based on past experience in implementing the programmes , as well as current community policies relating to structural operations .    2.929512656168724
the objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use , to the optimum and efficient use , as some of you have wished , of community involvement , including , mr UNK , using , if necessary , the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of european public monies .    2.6177692955337544
when i speak of optimum utilisation , i am referring both to the national and regional levels .    3.2238974841726318
and so , mr UNK , i shall also mention at this point , speaking of the national level , the link with the cohesion fund .    3.974146356262012
this is the purpose of these guidelines .    2.9461003972226103
regarding their content , as you know , ladies and gentlemen of this house , they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but , at the same time , very passionately , as i understood her presentation just now .    2.741040276807508
the first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create , in all sectors , but especially in the private sector , as mr berend said , the maximum number of serious , worthwhile and permanent jobs , the competitiveness of regional economies , all regional economies , and in particular , mr evans , that of wales , but not only of wales .    3.283413868282178
and , because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission , let me also add the regional economies of the european regions handicapped by their distance from the centre , be they remote regions , island regions or , of course , the most remote regions which are , naturally , the most distant .    3.2243223637251304
perhaps i may inform mr UNK e castro , who asked me about this , that , as i wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions , the commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report .    2.7345486846566707
concerning the most remote regions , it was only quite UNK that we received the memorandums from the various governments , but this is not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation .    3.062992410186493
we must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .    2.1679317441607098
i myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 november and , within the college , we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions . i would thank you for your understanding in this matter .    2.7207601285480956
so that is the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economies .    3.1878463341450627
the second priority , which several of you have stressed , mr puerta in particular , but there were others , not that i am mentioning them in any order of priority , is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment , particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past .    2.8615657311239078
ladies and gentlemen , we now have a european union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great , proving the effectiveness and worth of the cohesion fund , but where , at the same time , in relation to unemployment - as you wrote , mrs schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions . this is a situation which is , as it should be , unjustifiable and intolerable .    2.720019573168985
as far as i am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which i find unacceptable and i have every intention , as far as possible , with your support , of UNK all the appropriations for which i am responsible to this improved social , human and territorial cohesion , particularly in order to prevent what i once called in this house a two - speed europe , a europe of wealthy districts but , at the same time , a europe of impoverished areas .    2.986936678961935
in fact , the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account . the first is rural development , and let me say , mrs schroedter , that i am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport , an issue i have been involved in personally for a long time .    3.052407970099301
i particularly remember the time when i was minister for the environment in my own country . the second principle is that of equal opportunities , particularly for men and women , as well as the european strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary union .    3.4056166720420644
finally , and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this house , particularly yourself , mrs schroedter , in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies , for development or UNK , which , of all the priorities , offer the maximum opportunity to synergy , to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership . you expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership , yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines .    3.2048258087205275
however , i do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that , as far as i am concerned , this partnership - and i spent long enough as a regional UNK within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool , one used to involve local UNK , be it in the public sector , in the form of elected representatives , the social and educational sectors , associations , or in the private sector ; a decentralised partnership , and let me mention in this connection , in response to mrs angelilli , the territorial pacts , which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership .    2.8601000336970426
these are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities , since they must be taken into consideration , under each of the objectives , to different UNK in accordance with the specific situations of each of the member states and regions .    3.030236650604688
i should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made , ladies and gentlemen , and firstly on procedure .    2.7895649503237205
it is true that consultation with parliament has only come about at a late date .    2.1211292354987554
due to the elections to the european parliament taking place around this time , however , parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted , in july 1999 .    2.9536185133667776
here in this chamber , ladies and gentlemen , among you , i wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - mr hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as member states are concerned , your observations will certainly be taken into consideration .    3.2747567706072527
and let me assure you , furthermore , that when the commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid - term review in mind , in line with the regulations , then the point of view of this house , as expressed in this report , will also be taken into account .    3.4174814233743556
now to the form . on the subject of the role of the guidelines , mrs schroedter , you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of european objectives , often very precise ones , should be provided .    3.420063939212228
drawing to a close , i should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated , mrs schroedter .    3.1391211276047852
i am thinking , for example , of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations .    3.1179883241609394
this claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring ' s negotiations .    2.7572803447311256
the commission kept to the actual text of article 10 of the structural funds regulations , which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide member states with broad , indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed community policies .    2.561810716296983
i actually quoted the text itself , in UNK marks .    2.575605313507774
moreover , the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes .    2.5191546524825092
you then mentioned , mrs schroedter , the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development , pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration .    2.672190459791313
i find the opposite the case .    2.7768743545294403
i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .    2.59011039860413
indeed , i had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in tampere .    2.715019442364099
as regards rural development , which a number of you brought up , particularly mrs UNK UNK , the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur : a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas , but also protection of the environment and europe ' s rural heritage .    3.3625405823400225
it must , however , be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the structural funds , whose objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority .    2.853779439624697
and indeed , on the subject of the balance of rural society , let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the eaggf guarantee section , aimed at promoting reform in european agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture .    2.729019586994303
at this stage , i would simply like to say that i would like to see it integrated into the programming for objective 2 rural areas , in the way that the eaggf guidance section is for objective 1 regions .    3.547500344582231
in any event , i appreciate the vigilance of your committee on agriculture and rural development in this matter .    2.3361908482369356
before concluding , i should like to tell mr UNK that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck france , austria and germany , in particular , in the last few weeks , and at the same time we shall once again be discussing , together with my fellow commissioner , mrs de palacio , what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of france .    3.0729079810348456
i shall therefore reserve the right , if you permit , UNK , to give you my own opinion , which , to a great extent , matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using objective 2 .    2.9383351677102905
i shall remind you that the commission is going to be approving the objective 2 zoning plans for france , sweden , austria and luxembourg tomorrow .    2.8558007420688516
we shall then have an appropriate tool for working , particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms .    3.1269252831745065
indeed , this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the french departments which have been severely disabled by the storms .    2.86543848550866
in conclusion , with thanks for your understanding , mr president , i should like to thank you , mrs schroedter , for the quality of your work and that of the committee , and to tell you that i am very pleased , apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines . we have discussed this and i have attempted to clarify my point of view .    3.6776851637584995
this can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994 - 1999 programmes . i feel this UNK well for effective cooperation between our two institutions , at this time when programming for the period 2000 - 2006 is being undertaken , good joint working practice , which is , mr hatzidakis , backed up by something i am very attentive to : observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions .    2.5216354802406586
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.6677986406930794
social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union    3.8978936577318484
the next item is the debate on the report ( a5 - 0107 / 1999 ) by mr berend , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union [ sec ( 99 ) 0066 - c5 - 0120 / 99 - 1999 / 2123 ( cos ) ] .    2.4369030073165105
mr president , commissioner , this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report .    2.6954404858080347
the commission report generally UNK this observation , particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the union in which i have a special interest , by which i mean the french overseas departments and , more generally , the most remote regions .    3.1101685687555953
in this respect , i am pleased to see that the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and , more specifically , to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new article 299 ( 2 ) of the treaty of amsterdam .    2.74478656044297
finally , in my view , this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of europe , particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of europe and its more remote regions .    2.8942645629464456
even if the commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion , its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the community area through the union ' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the sec .    2.6862812735767134
mr president , the group of the party of european socialists in this parliament agrees with the report that mr berend has just presented and congratulates the author , both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility , which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee .    2.2783589128411212
it must be remembered that , currently , the european union ' s overall competitiveness is , in general terms , 81 % of that of the united states of america and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units , that is the regions , also improves . furthermore , this is at a time when technological development , economic globalisation and our problems , which are enlargement and the single currency , demand that the regions , as well as businesses and individuals , make more of an effort to be competitive .    3.0702337970897693
the european commission ' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .    2.6590731011965096
i shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .    2.623640100068963
the first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the union and that the community funds have been a major , although not decisive , factor in reducing regional inequalities .    3.1266621907662415
it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .    2.134211079214045
this , commissioner , is the first UNK for the coming period .    4.966715258348644
thus , mr president , i ask my fellow members to approve this report and i ask the commission , as other speakers have done , to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000 - 2006 .    3.202455875509662
mr president , commissioner , i would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it .    2.8215430108048865
the sixth UNK report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the union ' s regional policy aims .    3.134766127235007
very rapid growth is continuing in central europe .    2.4019186146122995
the strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general european average , whereas many southern european and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly .    1.9274890001846094
we now require an in - depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .    2.4074969901048333
is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences , long distances , UNK that are too cold or too hot , UNK populations and austere conditions ?    2.218313463979608
how can the union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development ?    3.0726372318462833
it is also important to discover what the effects of union enlargement will be on structural funds and the development of the union ' s more remote areas .    3.1168945671968156
the member states must also bear in mind their responsibility .    3.1203965636210964
some member states have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the union has been increased .    2.8231190672392916
this has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced .    2.3942407011921873
in the future , we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place .    2.861836711566478
for example , uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration .    2.7302122237802386
in this connection , too , weight has to be given to the decisive importance of smes as employers and forces behind regional development .    2.621392181882043
it is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know - how .    2.2549514223381864
our group is in favour of adopting this report .    3.502631331912777
mr president , commissioner , the european union ' s regional policy has , until now , not been able to interpret , in any significant way , the existing differences in our inhabitants ' incomes .    2.769514500403856
we have a serious situation in which in the european union today , there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached , on average , 23 . 7 % in the regions worst affected , regions which also happen to be poor areas , whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment , corresponding to the richer areas , unemployment stands at just 4 % .    2.4352944487086163
given this situation , the report approved by parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment : measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes , which are often UNK , with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems , with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the trans - european rail networks , which are due in UNK .    2.787296505676835
there should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries ' agriculture and fisheries , which are often UNK by the european union ' s own insensitive policies , as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs , particularly for women and young people . only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality , which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects .    2.8940734442642726
mr president , commissioner , mr berend ' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the european commission UNK as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore .    3.2300043631160307
the overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation , boosting equality of opportunity , increasing the sustainability of employment and development , are only mentioned in passing .    2.873708530492301
this attitude appears to me to be unjustified . i would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report .    2.8886703465691554
this does not mean that i do not see the need for competitiveness , particularly as i myself am an entrepreneur in an objective 1 region , that is in brandenburg in the federal republic of germany , and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium - sized enterprises .    2.779890783992955
it is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the objective 1 regions , that is to say job creation measures , special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business .    2.30818184936804
they are supported by appropriate european union structural fund activities .    2.364393900760895
supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there is no basis for a self - supporting upturn in these objective 1 regions .    2.938025867532753
after all , the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment UNK the fact than an increase of at least 3 % in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all .    2.425646561418941
concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand - orientated economic policy is not the answer .    2.8227221055602305
and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a lesser extent , in rationalisation .    2.4565455642245984
it is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand - orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas .    2.651163808064719
the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .    2.2752013724069533
in other words , what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there .    3.0706298126666307
for example , these would be measures for vocational training , for further education , for re - integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process , for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements , in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again .    2.664530085509423
mr president , my compliments to the rapporteur for his in - depth report .    2.604475768038509
the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the european union .    3.091805866165465
by stimulating a diversity of investments , the european union is endeavouring to increase the gdp per capita and to boost employment .    2.9307646927873896
from the sixth periodic report on the regions , one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect .    2.5906847538291427
the efforts made in order to drive up the gdp per capita in objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase , not really a satisfying result over a period during which , certainly over the past couple of years , there has been economic growth .    2.6080446913680864
as indicated by the rapporteur , the effects of the structural measures , on the other hand , are minimal as far as employment is concerned .    3.420983134019738
some reservation about the effectiveness of community aid is therefore called for .    2.562533414105051
also , the observation that the disparities between regions within member states sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions .    2.256141047971454
mr president , it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities , especially in connection with boosting employment .    2.5444329503654304
it is , after all , they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit .    2.1874324719730383
by allowing them to develop tailor - made plans for the relevant regions and , if necessary , tying this in with financial aid , a higher return can be achieved .    2.4636566572036225
surely this must be the ultimate goal .    2.9574765986376588
i am therefore in favour of the commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the member states and regions .    3.370447395606033
following on from this , it is probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to regions , to give member states more say anyway .    3.327249642022674
by shifting the criteria from the regions to the member states , we can avoid a great deal of problems later on .    3.1567764532782316
finally , i would like to draw attention to the position of the central and eastern european countries .    3.3277793008927397
the report shows that , in general , they are a long way behind eu countries , especially in terms of gdp per capita .    4.074285621979937
with the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future , it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy . i would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later .    3.2765763843712166
mr president , commissioner , following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part .    2.644498356459677
for example , whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased , there has been a certain amount of convergence between the member states themselves in this respect .    2.995289228113213
equally , unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some cases .    2.6039599852430495
i wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently .    3.81384956958299
even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries .    3.1612763120873555
since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout europe to reduce unemployment , then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development , improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training .    2.712244049450826
genuine structural reforms and a competition - friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base .    2.141812464174182
if we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost - intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed .    2.646440506497433
we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate .    4.260653621320981
mr president , commissioner , my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report , because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of europe will judge that we have been successful in our work .    2.9757937403001153
this issue , which has an impact on their everyday life , is a key issue as regards eu credibility .    3.2830270424481776
it has to be conceded that the eu has already aided , i would say quite UNK , the development of poor countries .    3.531859592233031
i remember what portugal and greece used to be like when i UNK through those countries for the first time twenty - five years ago .    2.299015079063773
in this connection , french speakers would speak of a " coup de UNK " : in other words , i take my hat off to the eu .    2.357287708352749
the eu really deserves such a gesture , but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great .    2.1090537996854737
what is the result ?    3.4621201384550098
people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a UNK .    2.1080758193876306
consequently , we have to build schools , hospitals , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over .    3.5856464801157504
this is very costly and it also causes very great social problems .    2.4530383387637036
most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised , if they were given the chance to , in other words , if there was work there .    3.9341960383283237
we must give them this opportunity .    2.6735427615385743
this is a moral obligation the eu and all of us have .    3.238390759456741
the solution , as i see it , lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship .    2.802084990904104
by entrepreneurship i do not simply mean the ownership of business , but creating will .    2.8805600973289365
i mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life , whether he or she is an employee , the owner of a business or an official .    2.1341622026053693
what is a fair society ?    2.9195644111735795
one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children .    2.2991330798767073
in this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance .    2.6237775764098945
finally , i would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from america , where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of UNK , as it often is here in europe .    2.666891237437463
mr president , commissioner , as my time is limited , i shall get straight to the point .    2.63185491591672
firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fruits of growth are not distributed UNK within the union .    2.6386539059074923
the most remote regions , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates , offer one example of this .    2.16713142284149
in UNK , for example , the rate is 37 % .    3.45110801957625
this is not a situation related to the economic climate , however ; rather it is a structural problem , created by our remoteness , our UNK , in short , our own specific personality .    3.0069779222758566
the principle of specific , exceptional treatment was envisaged in article 299 ( 2 ) of the treaty of amsterdam in order to deal with such cases .    2.8342661143297265
it only remains to put this principle into practice .    2.561893247862022
the commission document expected to be ready in december 1999 was delayed until january , then february , and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism .    2.3008529348535696
i therefore appeal formally to the council and the commission .    2.7077999858311594
as regards taxation , state aid , the structural funds and defending our traditional products , practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency .    2.2791642741409044
if these do not materialise , then , unfortunately , convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us , and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions , despite the size of the amounts committed , will end in failure .    2.9614921099954374
mr president , as all the previous speakers have done , i should like in turn to thank mr berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report .    2.9078355638779394
just like the previous report , this extremely competent and precise analysis , the recommendations it supports and your own comments , ladies and gentlemen , shall prove useful to the commission in general and to the commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000 - 2006 .    2.8918481464516357
i should also like to make a few comments , firstly , mr berend , regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report .    2.887689816616955
you pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote , if i am not mistaken , that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports .    3.1448004190699765
on behalf of all the officials of the commission and my predecessor , mrs wulf - mathies , i must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this house and by yourself .    3.2655389616512975
the commission was certainly very anxious to ensure , mr berend , that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you .    2.883359574584733
i am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2 . 1 of this report , where the commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported , improved and influenced by factors which some of you - mr markov , just now , and mrs UNK - stressed very forcefully .    2.3083886567182597
i am thinking of technological research and development , infrastructure provision and quality , human resources potential , small and medium - sized businesses and direct investment from abroad .    2.1199589474759195
so much for the quality .    3.2586138178029653
i do not wish to spend time right now , mr berend , going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your house has already endorsed .    2.5552013683086288
secondly , partnership , a subject which a number of you stressed , the role of local and regional authorities , the private sector , both sides of industry , associations and local community action groups .    2.9842481592567314
regarding this problem of partnership , i shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations are applied properly .    3.1375276973537707
thirdly , the need to develop the employment side of growth , even though i am aware , as mr van dam just said , that the prime responsibility is that of the member states , and that , when we speak of the responsibility of member states , and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy , we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in .    3.8051871349793434
mr fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed UNK .    2.5686937258803453
you will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike .    2.1418970331321625
i agree with your analysis .    2.777530842001961
when there is growth , it must be better distributed , but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness , be they the most remote or island regions , is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades .    2.846167512005028
fourthly , a point which mrs UNK UNK stressed just now , the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people .    2.748260596986134
fifthly , the importance and role of small and medium - sized businesses . mr vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now .    2.3263795024446994
finally , the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the structural funds , the motives of officials in managing these funds , even if it is occasionally complicated , and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation , follow - up and supervision of the commission .    3.0702219540492277
in relation to this , i must inform the european parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of structural funds .    3.1624636261361294
i should like to mention a few specific points .    2.4104969633300817
mr berend , you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly .    2.4461025567367076
well , we are coming to an end of the zoning phase .    3.6724726913882884
you may therefore be satisfied on this point , since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by objective 2 .    2.749217825369269
regarding the informal economy you mention in your report , i am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and , as mr UNK mentioned , there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data .    3.1871464268699623
to a certain extent , they are taken into account in the statistics on gdp and labour force surveys and , in any case , i wish to point out the efforts which eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics .    2.9608338827301126
mr berend , you also mentioned , as did mr UNK sánchez , the lack of reform in the fisheries sector .    2.9032668734854488
on this point which is of personal interest to me , let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context .    3.0598868937462784
this type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the directorate general for fisheries , under commissioner fischler .    2.370856682575932
nonetheless , i must assure you that the commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which , no doubt , will respond better to these concerns .    3.0188105992977565
several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion , and your rapporteur mentioned some of these .    3.3918244469936165
i wish to assure you , firstly , that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is , as far as i am concerned , mr berend , an extremely important instrument , not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner , so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated , but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of europe and , furthermore , with the elected representatives , i . e . yourselves , on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a european regional planning policy .    3.2099043079483494
in any event , i have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report : the definition , compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of central and eastern europe ; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned , particularly mrs sudre and mr fruteau ; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of central and eastern europe . this will constitute a great challenge to us all , for you and for the commission , in the next few years .    3.0793403239369375
and finally , there are the cross - border aspects . i shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points .    3.0277049862296894
finally , i should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are , in any case , familiar with , but whose main elements i should like to reiterate .    2.9950988429649392
ladies and gentlemen , considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence , particularly for the four cohesion countries , but also frankly , mr UNK , for the objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development , especially regarding infrastructure .    2.9718861365740845
this is my first point regarding the policy .    2.8211249505005562
my second point regarding the policy is as follows : the structural funds have made , and continue to make , a significant contribution to the convergence process .    3.1351514557126348
all the macroeconomic models we are working on show that , over the last decade , more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the structural funds .    2.7265983985567415
i have , however , taken note , particularly with regard to the most remote regions , mrs sudre , mr fruteau , and mr nogueira román too , that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take - up aspects , the fight against social exclusion , which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions , and the integration of women and young people into the labour market .    3.301141580603398
now to my fourth point regarding the policy ; enlargement of the union , the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions , the major challenge , too , for the european policy on cohesion , a point which mr van dam highlighted .    3.2100833750558695
i shall say that something is already taking shape in berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us .    3.3628216251680687
i am thinking in particular of the pre - accession structural instrument , which i shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks .    2.948438500777563
you see , ladies and gentlemen , we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the union ' s enlargement on our structural policy .    3.08782272792843
this sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole , mr berend , is a good basis for our thinking , for us all and for myself .    2.8941146066647367
i should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines , as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000 - 2006 .    3.608874844400275
thank you very much , commissioner .    1.9725151098002782

mr president , i respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the president of the house to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the minutes .    2.7544917156307847
i refer to item 11 on the order of business .    2.3162554706399288
firstly , i believe the issue raised by the president of the socialist group yesterday about the UNK of the debate with the president of the commission on the five - year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated .    3.2635079378550484
i wish to express that view even if i respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the president of the socialist group .    2.7716480170837183
the second point i would like to make - and which i would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this parliament , as other speakers remarked yesterday , can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the european commission .    3.017346115048871
we should also have the UNK to recognise that , if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and UNK by the president of the commission , but also by a five - year programme , we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this house , so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the commission what our wishes were .    3.5199357750352136
there is one basic lesson i would like us to learn from this .    3.048403611470569
when there are major set - piece debates scheduled between this house and the european commission in the future , we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance .    2.9293985991248483
there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this house and then between this house and the commission .    3.2134076175865927
we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary UNK in institutional relationships .    2.247955155707094
looking at some of the press reports of last friday , i believe that the commission and its president exercised commendable self - restraint in the way they commented publicly .    3.3035419335007075
that is something for which i have a deep appreciation .    3.4735236876111
i hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which i believe was founded on a UNK as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions .    2.606665031211656
it should not be UNK into something more than that .    2.9672002132663136
thank you very much , mr cox .    2.2119994277477217
i understand what you are saying .    3.0813617217023896
we have taken note of this .    2.70528142376902
mr president , concerning item 11 of the minutes on the order of business , we agreed yesterday to have the bourlanges report on today ' s agenda .    2.4966279214244795
however , it was withdrawn from the committee on budgets last night without being discussed or voted on .    2.8357893925003457
it therefore needs to be withdrawn from today ' s agenda .    2.9458968823294676
mr UNK , that makes sense .    3.4469202003308665
the report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda .    2.592498993350889
mr president , regarding mrs lynne ' s comments yesterday about health and safety in this building , i presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the tower .    2.3532053625910687
i do not want to UNK up the issue of this building endlessly , but this is a serious problem .    3.4327839395612556
mrs ahern , we have taken note of this .    3.6565282746571914
i would ask you to bring this specific case , which has to do with the UNK on a particular floor , to the attention of the quaestors , who are , in fact , responsible for the matter .    3.8193597239749724
we will also pass this on to our services , however .    2.59809188612847
thank you very much .    2.353503084677091
( the minutes were approved )    2.0038305127267746
reform of european competition policy    3.813848945943322
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :    2.0795770254299333
a5 - 0069 / 1999 by mr von wogau , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the commission white paper on modernisation of the rules implementing articles 85 and 86 of the ec treaty [ com ( 1999 ) 101 - c5 - 0105 / 1999 - 1999 / 2108 ( cos ) ] ;    2.2143720220352656
a5 - 0078 / 1999 by mr rapkay , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the european commission ' s xxviiith report on competition policy 1998 [ UNK ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - 0121 / 1999 - 1999 / 2124 ( cos ) ] ;    2.3722295069920776
a5 - 0087 / 1999 by mr jonckheer , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the seventh survey on state aid in the european union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors . [ com ( 1999 ) 148 - c5 - 0107 / 1999 - 1999 / 2110 ( cos ) ] ( report 1995 - 1997 ) ;    2.2555467519480605
mr president , commissioner , today we are engaged in an important debate about the european union ' s competition policy .    2.7931221647996325
we are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for european monopolies law , that is mr von wogau ' s report , and it is far more controversial than the vote in the committee on economic and monetary affairs may have given us reason to believe .    2.8797635711619107
i want to make it quite clear that in this specific case i personally consider the commission ' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term " modernisation " to describe the content of articles 81 and 82 of the white paper , or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression " retrograde step " .    2.976993353389122
however , we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter .    2.851742409421294
but , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this white paper .    2.805610472351087
it is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy .    3.393036164720268
on reading both commission documents , one UNK that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed , which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us .    2.3567384972287932
allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture . as the competent authority , the commission , with its logically consistent approach , has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition , not always to the delight of the member states or enterprises concerned .    2.930336677095737
it should continue along this path .    2.7070515127107737
but , commissioner , none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the union , the deepening of the internal market , technological progress , globalisation .    3.012346186241062
indeed , it is not just about modernisation of community law , more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases , about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions , for the european competition policy will be dependent on the population ' s acceptance , together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned .    3.2530817992350074
only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .    2.4928272436981618
the competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there is nothing that could not be further improved upon .    3.4136554484871113
our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , commissioner , but there is one point that i would just like to go into now . transparency and accountability belong together .    3.358854997916653
i do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the commission and parliament into question .    2.842116878164608
here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensifying it .    2.415061694224732
there is one thing i would like to make quite clear though . parliament is a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law , of all things , is truly scandalous .    3.6074180216362866
therefore , i would urge the council and the intergovernmental conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .    3.829451823132642
i expect the commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve parliament in doubtful cases , even given the treaty status quo .    2.276461695066534
i also expect the commission to be pro - active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures .    2.4648664468363974
this will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions .    3.296286618104722
with all due respect for the principle of competition , competition is not , however , an end in itself .    3.8877471622155513
competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions .    2.6858546709832796
at the end of the day , one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an UNK .    2.7686994854006515
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts .    2.2830521518407685
but optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord .    2.513031132906129
framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses , monopolies law being one example .    2.3592505249191054
but on the whole , this only serves to prevent abuses ; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation .    2.2318991751820167
competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .    2.2150802747082086
however , since state aid forms the lion ' s share of the competition report 1998 i would still like , regardless of mr jonckheer ' s report , to say one more thing about it .    2.4227539117828
it is certainly possible , indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium - sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy .    2.8097710523317807
indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes , provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .    2.9852326451269953
this is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible .    2.9829418224596025
it is not just that we should UNK state aid ; rather our approach must be one of drawing UNK and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above - mentioned objectives .    2.978214041523542
my last comment was intended not so much for the commission as for the members of the group of the european people ' s party .    3.3824991025195983
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report which i have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the commission ' s annual report on the state aid in force within the european union and for which the community is authorised under articles 87 , 88 and 89 of the treaties .    3.220182608077805
the commission report is essentially a UNK report UNK the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors , according to various UNK , such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued .    3.142656249776649
let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid , on average , for the period under review , is in the order of eur 95 billion , corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993 - 1995 , a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the federal republic of germany .    2.8388740583497505
to put it plainly , the level of state aid declared , roughly speaking , is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1 . 2 % of community gdp or more or less the equivalent , UNK , of the community budget for one year .    2.897476667995224
this being the case , there are considerable disparities between states , which may be measured in various ways , such as , for example , as a percentage of added value and per wage UNK .    2.967009886338842
i think it is also interesting to add state aid and community aid , which may be UNK in some way into state aid .    3.0960213227953646
this clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the cohesion fund , among other things , which come at the top of the list .    3.098714834786278
this being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .    3.604517158636366
we note , first of all , that the committee considers the data , as presented in the commission ' s annual report , to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in - depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate , sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition , pursuant to the actual terms of the treaty .    3.2230434736794007
the commission can only UNK and analyse the data provided by the member states .    2.4905412748242832
it is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided , and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect .    3.142506447636418
it is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , has championed the UNK idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the internet .    2.7109195280134237
having better , more detailed information available , particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded , must make it possible for the european commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies .    2.901646968518254
and insofar as such studies already exist , to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the treaties , which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the european economy , but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion .    3.490526661125547
by stressing , primarily , the quality of the information provided , our debate in committee , and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you , avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was , in absolute terms , either too high or not high enough .    2.7785819629554136
most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between , on the one hand , the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and , on the other hand , acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the treaty , particularly , as i have said already , as regards sustainable development , research and development and economic and social cohesion .    3.4090717505125836
this being the case , various amendments to the rapporteur ' s initial draft report were adopted in committee , particularly highlighting the need for effective UNK of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results .    2.8823208886554057
seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting .    2.6960677552137247
there is in particular one amendment , let me point out , concerning the energy sector , which , in my capacity as rapporteur , i see as particularly important .    3.349658235388663
i should like to conclude this presentation , commissioner , by stressing two things : firstly , a concern of the members of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee .    3.0997988553378546
the concern involves the pre - accession process for the countries of central and eastern europe , in terms of competition policy and state aid .    3.1127463274213785
this is undoubtedly a complex issue , and one where we should like to see the commission informing us of the latest development in the matter , particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and , as far as state aid is concerned , the need , in all UNK , to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors .    3.5620367211572272
and finally , in conclusion , our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the european parliament in the matters we are discussing , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the intergovernmental conference .    3.4507341023781457
as you know , commissioner , our report UNK that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .    3.061276727088209
mr president , commissioner , my contribution to today ' s debate concerns the steel aid code , that is the state aid in europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the commission .    2.880206352402771
the ecsc treaty is due to expire shortly .    2.8515938786792665
hence , what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future .    3.666549275622633
the european commission ' s decisions , which feature in the report , are welcomed by the european parliament , as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases , thus applying article 88 of the ecsc treaty .    3.051175452446394
the competitiveness of the european steel industry also forms the subject of the commission ' s most recent communication , which we have not yet debated in parliament .    3.881516351137492
as in other sectors , the general ban on state aid according to article 87 ( 1 ) of the ec treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry .    2.8334013640907942
according to this article , state aid is irreconcilable with the common market , in principle . exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases .    2.619940211415275
under article 88 , the commission is obliged to supervise state aid .    3.2253664757010676
in 1998 , the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling eur UNK million to the UNK in germany .    2.687244768401296
furthermore , the member states must give the commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid .    3.0182824568179285
these stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular , precisely - defined cases i . e . those involving aid for research and development , aid for environmental protection , social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non - competitive enterprises cease trading altogether .    2.4095374329328667
however , there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report .    2.673691027609054
as far as parliament is concerned , it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired .    3.036551884461921
there must be no watering - down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code .    2.4004246493632726
no one wants an UNK subsidy competition in europe .    2.3773447415888422
this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years .    3.3295284334628312
consequently , parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry ' s claims about unequal treatment , and for the commission to provide the council with follow - up regulations .    3.2256347191665276
we all know that so far the council has dragged its feet with regard to follow - up regulations of this kind .    3.1007232693011946
the reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires , they will be able to do their own thing again without the UNK of the european commission ' s supervision .    3.686016849056589
we therefore demand that once the treaty expires , steel aid must be regulated by a council regulation according to article 94 , for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .    2.7409354828368415
this is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code .    2.338189274759259
a council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments .    2.890111164310679
what we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets .    2.8005702364553398
we also need to criticise the commission ' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view , do not fall within the categories of the code , even given the fact that the european court of justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned .    2.478380074934001
the commission will be called upon , in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999 , to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the UNK of restructuring plans and approved exemptions , thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made .    3.0403447448249294
once the committee on economic and monetary affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions , i would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves created , in plenary sitting .    2.794659155902776
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the internal market is not complete .    2.666827425035791
subsidies , monopolies and barriers to competition are still UNK markets and development alike .    2.3629411103630105
national governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time , but then it happens again .    3.195033920190371
a successive phasing out of state aid is required , and more and more markets must be opened up to competition .    3.072802422195688
this applies to those which have been turned into monopolies , both private and public .    2.6567668547585717
public monopolies are , more often than not , phased out reluctantly .    2.246806771626212
increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare , including within the spheres of education , health care and social services .    2.614844019763611
public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures .    2.53308231543341
europe must be modernised , made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies .    2.281730193970768
effective competition UNK prices down and raises standards of living .    2.30117071854245
it is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently .    2.398727169114961
in fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .    2.9431946072111193
the internal market is the basis for our work .    4.003982807390065
its legislation is to apply equally to all , to large and small countries alike .    2.7046772769597345
a systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled .    2.8307086589030273
the eu ' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed .    3.2094656631225935
the new model now being tested by the commission ought not to lead to a process of UNK pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy .    2.8435280649797314
in order to be effective , it must be well anchored in the member states ' national authorities .    3.1583942920465335
in six months ' time , it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation ' s effects upon the commission ' s role .    3.3206658106677236
the question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter - institutional congress which will open up an UNK debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests .    2.263743247446655
this will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed .    3.4687135316460407
there will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate .    2.856432162530089
the law must be correctly applied in matters of competition .    2.648422945557377
wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership , which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for .    2.665097550829315
we have a quite exciting debate in front of us .    2.481254741106291
a conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to UNK out misunderstandings , at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points .    2.515679504056704
parliament and the commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens .    3.047823604150439
in fact , in my own constituency of stockholm , we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies .    2.454479815773737
we would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by mr von wogau and mr rapkay .    2.7982452481763125
we hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law .    2.8618205380828217
mr president , as a new member i am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today , even though there has been a delay .    3.337682501354003
i would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs mr von wogau , mr langen , mr rapkay and mr jonckheer , as well as the commission , for their excellent cooperation .    2.971872225350925
competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and european competition policy is a success story ; take the energy and telecommunications sectors , where there has been a UNK lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service .    2.5887786865459823
all this is to the good of the consumer .    3.410228639492677
but we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further .    3.2000896207178617
the commission has put forward a new white paper on this containing two key points : dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement .    2.1226296313754784
dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate .    2.3287330821980023
at the same time , this change of system will also lead to more UNK being placed on the individual in the business world , of course .    2.6329060789747167
it will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved ; for one thing , each person will have to take responsibility themselves , and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters .    2.6555367562240093
however i believe that we should use this opportunity for europe to set down a UNK for less red tape .    3.061903431492809
the second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement .    2.218802103353937
if we are to create a culture of law in europe , then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the commission , by central bodies , but also by national authorities , by national courts .    3.534182606480383
the way to a european monopolies commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .    2.6226335190545877
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .    3.5364856989704267
parliament must have more involvement and i also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted , then this would encourage the member states to be more disciplined .    3.5177848237299476
however , when it comes to what the future holds for competition , there are two issues dear to my heart .    2.9718507365642326
one is subsidiarity .    2.8629729032969684
we all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency , and i believe we should also permit competition in the regions .    3.4261439724124796
competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the european union .    2.7869688065929545
i would cite , by way of example , the issue of job creation schemes , savings banks and regional banks , and UNK .    2.805630371335994
here , a region has , by its own efforts , created a means of marketing its own products .    2.512352056656946
this own initiative must not be destroyed by european intervention .    2.778629910256221
i believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation .    3.081469827300743
we should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other .    2.7632999657746105
my second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although i am not going to talk about market failure just now .    2.796950359619421
i have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector , but i would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters .    2.9310490012925836
these days , someone who lives in an old people ' s home is accommodated within the social field .    2.5780664823044894
however , i could also regard them as a customer , and i believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field , that is UNK structures , stifle competition .    2.834693071161579
apart from that , i could refer to any customers , any sector , as customers , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields .    2.260021749505559
to conclude , i would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity . i believe it to be of vital importance that where member states allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes , they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across - the - board regulation by europe .    3.1052952239287044
thank you very much , mr radwan .    2.381313752165935
i would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in german parliamentary - speak , UNK in your case , as a maiden speech .    2.57186790811188
mr president , commissioner , i am speaking on behalf of my fellow member , robert goebbels , who is unable to attend due to a political commitment .    2.7280893446513104
within the committee on economic and monetary affairs , the jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market .    2.8507807459531196
a slim right - wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures .    2.311217160967756
even if the majority in this house were to adhere to this UNK idea of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world .    3.093394948535268
economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources .    2.2918488058007136
while , since the dawn of time , the market has been the key forum for human UNK , it has never been perfect .    3.4730644916997955
the market favours the short term and immediate profits .    2.5411853511428935
on the market , the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties , consumers and workers .    2.5833976865162906
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be UNK by a sense of responsibility towards society .    2.8228779848186836
we european socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .    3.066787172692849
the market is not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .    2.971514765061045
the european union or individual states must not take over from economic operators , but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion .    2.427296169070753
finally , aid can enable restructuring , offer training , save jobs and thus know - how .    2.0888457620919527
the main objective of the union ' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid .    3.195584238188555
this aid must be aligned with the objectives of the union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .    3.2274402043278236
the commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market .    2.3624968571471623
it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .    2.414641313960885
the internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research financed by the american army .    3.8133840486723263
the world wide web , which has enabled the UNK development of the information society , was developed by UNK in geneva , once again with public aid .    2.936810623176726
president duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism .    2.4282139199097768
i did not hear mr duisenberg criticising the intervention of the american monetary authorities to save the hedge fund , UNK .    2.199724288619341
wishing to save 60 000 jobs is , apparently , a sin against the market , but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market .    2.34635519302359
public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation , as was the case in mexico , asia and brazil .    2.7286518954444756
human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equation .    3.298696415790794
we socialists reject the liberals ' naïve optimism on this point .    2.3942006757724807
we want a true culture of competition in europe .    2.567651191812131
the state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the commission must act as judge .    3.0551384019780596
mr president , commissioner , i want to begin by thanking mr rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation .    2.6142766763235445
i want to thank you , commissioner monti , for your outstanding cooperation and i want to tell you that , as we enter the new millennium , you have an especially important role .    3.450308552213027
it is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments . these may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy , but their capacity to UNK havoc seems UNK .    2.305417993991208
let me mention the latest examples we have seen : holzmann , a company which receives considerable aid from the german government ; UNK in former east germany ; and , especially , aid to shipyards .    2.1672514401396237
these are three areas in which many danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being UNK out of their markets .    2.527184983448229
i want to say to mr poos that i very much agree with mr duisenberg that these examples show that some eu member states are not in a position to restructure their economies and , to that extent , are helping to undermine the value of the euro .    2.6671451743560084
the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee , all concerning state aid .    2.3929596577478423
these are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which is very important with a view to making the internal market work .    3.641752307615579
i should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party .    2.2547957515337935
as i say , our amendments concern transparency , and i should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful , specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be .    3.0275736380071323
another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful .    3.616767875961896
how do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back ?    2.686995123398325
at present , there are no common rules in this area , and we vigorously urge the commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment .    3.7607091693087327
this is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition .    2.8763648432862876
finally , we propose keeping both a register , as mentioned by a number of my fellow meps , and also a scoreboard showing where the member states at present stand with regard to state aid .    3.0362845367724685
you have shown us the way , mr monti , with the single market scoreboard .    3.3319804019947035
it was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .    2.8194679370201183
i very much hope that you , commissioner monti , will support these amendments , and i look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter .    2.917170638338751
to conclude , i want to welcome the commission ' s UNK report on competition policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work has been done .    3.9176722275243154
but , as i have already mentioned , our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness .    2.8873886334459122
there is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned , and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid .    3.1481077924786116
this is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the union , and i should like to thank mr jonckheer who , in his report , has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria , as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition .    3.1747640417918506
as liberals and greens , we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look , but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives , and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems .    2.857150258856451
mr president , commissioner , there are just two questions which must be answered .    3.047288560918938
are state aid to business or inter - company agreements legitimate in a market economy , and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy ?    2.6610067248024065
regarding the first point , we say quite clearly that , in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the european union has endorsed , it is essential that , in some instances , there is state aid to businesses , be it in the form of tax exemptions , special taxation or even direct aid .    3.6111699578499534
so our clear response is that , yes , such aid and such agreements are legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified .    2.709257746196785
the von wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level .    2.477646473072111
we feel this is relatively dangerous , but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the commission cannot do everything .    3.272376012603196
we demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact .    2.9765630316814295
mr president , once again we are debating the european union ' s competition policy .    3.082766835860532
but let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us .    3.0028348562340974
the overriding features of today ' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of UNK powerful multinational groups .    2.2657844772770055
should we not be discussing this issue ?    2.821775300251406
we need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private - sector monopolies .    2.3540623245615633
certain sectors of european industry , such as the shipbuilding industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have been hard hit by existing competition policy , have suffered UNK .    2.7917966134938523
they have lost their status , and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant .    3.28325761432754
when will we debate that ?    2.6850000593472476
the scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states , and member states of the union at that .    2.60208553295496
and yet , we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by UNK public procurement contracts placed with public - sector corporations as state aid .    2.2152088645617702
at the same time , unemployment is UNK as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs .    2.7921723508375624
workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights .    2.777812510890678
consumers see their standard of living being eroded , poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the union being dismantled and UNK in the name of UNK and catastrophic competition , in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business .    2.8961372482034227
we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it .    2.978748751380239
mr president , commissioner , in the course of this pivotal year , prior to the changeover to the single currency , the commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment .    3.0522717748148684
the competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .    3.0888331137749465
for our part , we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which , far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency , imprisons us in an artificial UNK , which has been imposed on the peoples of europe .    2.4978452096301367
having said that , governing means planning . it also means being responsible and , in this new context which has been forced upon us , competition law naturally has an essential role to play .    2.7248876453472244
in this area , the commission has given priority to a number of routes of action : acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti - competitive practices , by UNK its departments ' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law .    2.2805999931177667
as regards state aid , it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex , and the introduction of a public register , where all aid would be recorded , does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints .    2.7532205419589157
finally , on the subject of modernising the implementation of articles 85 and 86 of the treaty , we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction .    2.7821543918995055
the commission is , in fact , retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities , but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the commission at all .    2.8104160475179176
national states would thus become the secular arm of the commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control .    3.0189394074897784
in conclusion , i would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction , we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the UNK of federalism which , if it were realised , would be to the detriment of europe and the sovereignty of the states .    3.3346560237863496
mr president , commissioner , we have a basically positive view of the commission ' s white paper on competition , particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation , but we are also UNK by several things .    3.3377350836468107
first of all , there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers , though necessary in many ways , will cause an abnormal increase in competition - related initiatives , and that some people will be tempted to use competition law , not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails , of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets , but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy , planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves , or even for protectionist purposes .    2.447312146269898
in this respect , we should heed the words of von UNK , and doubtless also those of the great italian liberal UNK UNK , who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti - competition policies .    2.684293170899268
state interference in the economy is , even today , still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for european users and consumers .    2.97228116177675
there is state aid for businesses - we have already discussed this , there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the italian treasury controls 15 % of stock exchange UNK ; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions ; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about UNK ' s bid for UNK and the UNK of holzmann .    2.792833357153468
finally , commissioner , we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state , ranging from state television , which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer , and the post office , to some compulsory insurance schemes , including health and social welfare systems , which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no - one but the wealthy user with any other option .    2.683135049740462
commissioner , i am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the treaties , but i believe that , it must be emphasised once again that the european economy is finding it hard to compete with the american economy , especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition .    3.3284018016511303
mr president , a white paper , by definition , is not something you can take or leave .    2.7154420763625327
it is there to generate reactions and the white paper has certainly succeeded in doing that .    2.5042698547824385
it forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense .    3.0272485003069263
i understand where the authors are coming from and i share their views .    2.3161541323767216
i also assume that you , commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective .    2.6611488077891297
i cannot imagine the commission taking initiatives in order to de - UNK or re - UNK in a thorough manner , but i have my concerns and questions nevertheless .    3.039474639332086
firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy ' s application .    3.0447847452666292
the internal market needs a uniform competition policy , not only in terms of concept , but also in terms of application .    3.804536156374566
it is true , there are some european regulations and UNK statements on the way .    3.1269245792937324
the commission is also said to have the right of UNK and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities .    3.407839316479607
but i still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of UNK UNK where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward .    3.023270204214691
so , i would like to hear more about how the commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the white paper to be feasible .    2.520492058709702
secondly , i understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty .    2.5630010491458957
many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern .    2.3540484286291488
this instrument will fall by the UNK in future .    3.119393656915926
in the white paper , you state that the commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines , but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next ?    2.8523596571678387
thirdly , i would like to know whether the commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy .    2.6683141736393337
i have particular concerns regarding the fate of smes which will lose part of their legal and financial protection , as is already the case , one has got to admit , within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector .    2.369719227268425
fourthly , i would like to be informed of why the commission does not choose to apply the UNK penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules .    3.164548164619432
fifthly , with the pending enlargement , i wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game .    2.9949233605100485
they are still in training , as it were .    3.378725281478788
what guarantees do we have that they will grow into first - class players in the league of the internal market ?    2.759841348535184
sixthly and lastly , i would remind you of a point that i have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions , namely the legal privilege of company lawyers .    3.12374071359136
if the commission implements the white paper objectives , it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable .    2.5308574523109213
is the commission considering taking any action to allow in - house lawyers in all member states legal privilege ?    2.439600659501961
commissioner , i am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and i hope that , in this sense , we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain UNK but can bear fruit .    3.318922609884025
mr president , i would like , in beginning my speech regarding the white paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , mr von wogau .    2.648484162484546
the fact that the group of the party of european socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure .    2.8973991450591874
we are , therefore , in agreement with the report , commissioner , as well as the broad outlines of the white paper .    4.175854590693366
since the treaty entered into force , community law on competition has been one of the tenets of community policy .    2.8635488629187495
after almost forty years of being in force , these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion . for this reason , modernisation was essential .    2.238463980456472
that modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons . firstly , the authorisation system ; secondly , decentralised application ; thirdly , procedural rules ; fourthly , judicial application ; and fifthly and finally , excessive red tape .    2.2349083917795554
the system of individual approvals needed urgent reform , as was unanimously requested by specialised companies , UNK and lawyers .    2.7696904531563646
i have not attended a single forum of UNK in competition law which has not requested a change to the system .    2.6626014362600174
a system , such as the current one , which is capable of making so few decisions , be they approvals or UNK , is something less than a valid system .    3.2056858400847585
national competition authorities were able to apply articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 for some time .    2.7684512094743745
however , they could not apply article 81 ( 3 ) , which , to a certain extent , prevented the coherent application of article 81 ( 1 ) .    2.635397230683218
you will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the court of justice , both brought by german courts , which question the feasibility of applying 81 ( 1 ) without being able to apply 81 ( 3 ) .    2.5277519023061714
a reform of this point was therefore also necessary .    2.7696440881609203
the procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in regulation 1762 .    2.6120195573547966
the voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous .    2.9466817819419036
the fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure , that it did not establish time limits , that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files , or that the right to defence was not properly recognised , were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform .    2.58076419964029
it was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .    2.4977705640229315
one of the most frequent criticisms of community competition law is its excessive red tape .    2.2963617875852043
as a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreements are anti - competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market .    2.1510102033708463
it was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .    2.5287997109363327
the white paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals .    2.9172040707581077
it is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report .    2.4799949563550445
amongst these , firstly , is the fact that , despite trying to modernise articles 81 and 82 , article 81 and not article 82 carries exclusive weight .    2.713136387314581
at the moment , with inter - company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them , the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important .    1.9851493838210614
secondly , regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation .    2.3082649365956973
for these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .    3.6553411705039416
however , if some of the amendments are accepted , particularly those presented by the ppe - de group , we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document , lacking in rigour and , in that event , we would reconsider our support .    2.839281695175852
mr president , amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate , i would like to comment on the one mentioned by mr berenguer , that is to say , the modernisation of competition policy , which is the subject of the commission ' s white paper .    3.7037750449225633
frankly , i believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .    3.235221003120266
through his management , commissioner monti achieves good results , as did his predecessor and , clearly , he has established a guarantee which , in parallel with the creation and development of the european internal market , has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the union may work adequately , without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged , as has happened in the european union since 1993 .    2.921221716957982
if it functions well , if we are satisfied , if the commission has basically acted correctly , why the need for the modification ?    3.3692023609420327
various arguments have been presented in its favour .    2.8656183960524264
because , if this is not the case , we will be faced with the paradox that the commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the european internal market .    3.956120928505141
in that event we would not have moved forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the union .    3.957739938538707
i would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur , mr rapkay , who has UNK this UNK and comprehensive text in such a concise way .    2.7242596745569987
i would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the basque country , which i represent - a margin for action , by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity .    3.158607372895123
the only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval , through individual cases , which will take more than six or eight months to resolve , an excessively long period , which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility , affecting the generation of wealth and employment .    2.2895091959453007
i therefore believe that something is missing and i suggest that we establish more regulations , lay down clear rules , which will benefit all of us : businesspeople , investors , workers and the citizens in general .    2.4888608401737025
mr president , i would like to stress that , in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future .    2.5396797509902997
this is why i give this report my full support .    2.369085829245594
recently , i have noticed that the commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner , precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility , both for products and for services .    3.19376738517141
i would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future , for europe ' s economy , and , above all , for the protection of our wealth and technological development in europe in general .    3.8570244448391713
mr president , for british conservatives the efficient and uniform application of european competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the european union .    2.3687885528732333
it therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined .    2.1821801225380684
the truth is that the single market is not yet complete .    3.621907033875321
during my six months as a member of this parliament , i have become acutely aware of the determination of many members to drive forward what is described as the european project .    3.2592500996624816
we daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper europe .    2.9407412198713816
but all this , in effect , is so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true european single market .    2.7731406429057364
that is the context in which i want to consider the commission ' s proposals .    3.811808454159341
i should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for commissioner monti .    3.103133111301074
we look to him as the man to root out UNK .    2.2577547968151515
but he would recognise that , as for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination . that is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the committee for economic and monetary affairs , mr von wogau .    3.220440444214096
i want to congratulate him , sadly in his absence , for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side !    2.6492344047526117
he mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .    2.577600719570815
so although i may not share his conclusions , i believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the commission must address .    3.348219297558799
the first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .    2.398129314967317
i know that the commission is set against this , but the potential exists .    3.480747540093227
i remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities .    2.6603120564211764
i remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .    2.6413145414039576
i asked commissioner monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation .    2.6750525132372838
mr von wogau said we can look to the european court .    3.393636077257866
well , we in britain are looking to the european court at the moment .    3.3046072089172696
we find that the european court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with france at the moment , in which we have the support of the commission .    4.1623209199194395
unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point , in the UNK case , in which the british government was the defendant , it took ten years for the european court to give a ruling .    3.883382221967666
so , judicially , something needs to be done .    2.7195142579518063
i ask the commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area .    3.088403446610086
in relation to legal certainty , i endorse the point made by mrs thyssen .    2.903285299465107
it is important that business has legal certainty .    2.155403051624823
i mentioned this again to commissioner monti recently .    2.6046186112072025
he said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .    2.781627337673177
i must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the united kingdom .    2.534441622348892
we all have , as it were , our histories to live with , but it is important that business has legal certainty .    2.8328602005157357
i would also ask the commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business : a cost - benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more european policy .    2.278590215766812
i know there has been an analysis of the implications for the commission of the change .    3.8490267794446327
we have been told how , currently , people ' s time is being wasted and that the changes , therefore , could be beneficial .    3.3425527089590608
but i really feel that , in the circumstances , we want to know what the implications would be for business .    3.5889888116927633
finally , we , as british conservatives , are looking for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority .    3.0325909113157756
i would like to hear what commissioner monti has to say about that .    2.333490964881654
mr president , the european union ' s competition policy has been of central importance since european integration began .    2.6027574872127497
it is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies .    3.0169682739110772
we can be proud of a european competition culture , for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality .    3.31093981178977
we can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision .    2.5423894091927846
however , we must be vigilant in the face of global operators , against whom nation - states are no longer able to impose limits .    2.577849370477267
that is why we should bear in mind what was said by the french UNK UNK UNK , who described the state of the world in terms of the economy ' s UNK of terror .    3.7113443680224094
society is surrendering itself to the economy .    2.850107666463515
that is precisely what we do not want in the european union .    3.1693740808868016
we are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 usd 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take - overs - restrictive practices are being held in check , not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the usa or japan , or others , until we get the international competition law we so badly need .    2.2041545983734916
european competition policy , as we very often forget , is not just important for fair competition as such , but also for prices , growth and employment , and hence for the public .    3.639361847724905
in common with the other members , i call for parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned .    2.865833477220991
it is essential that this long overdue step be taken .    2.2586680081887542
it is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .    2.6915335900806197
i welcome the fact that commissioner monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the european parliament , as he does in the dialogue with non - governmental organisations , consumer protection associations and the public .    3.226093888016332
greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy .    2.4962434941218774
then it is possible to understand that , for example , lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to european competition policy , and brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are , of course , bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context .    2.896078863006351
it is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of eu enlargement .    3.0367578728345137
emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis .    2.8087121832635105
at the same time , it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to UNK the deficiencies of the market and furthering community objectives .    2.8258672235228297
a word on the white paper : the revision of articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy .    2.6144965202210644
i am opposed to this , unlike the majority of this house and indeed the majority of my own group , because i believe that , in competition policy terms , the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met , and i believe there is a threat of renationalisation .    3.1687645797503423
the problem of UNK highlighted by the commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system .    3.67338262419984
indeed , it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the treaty .    2.558237857037724
mr president , i am very glad that mrs randzio - plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so .    2.174343759454376
the UNK of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within european business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions .    2.5349700885212942
for example , the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the european area was eur 1 . 4 UNK , which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last european merger boom in 1990 .    2.696289469870902
this poses enormous challenges for competition policy , which i hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale .    2.5016288947994383
commissioner monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the eldr group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices .    2.205423097495952
delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what mr von wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the european element , and , particularly would ask the commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that .    3.4397097424361833
mr president , in the limited time i have , i would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here , in particular by mr jonckheer , who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio - economic balance in the granting of aid .    3.1568506141610455
i also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of article 82 , especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration .    2.712884124241138
as a member for the basque country , i would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market .    3.3356615467534527
i say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the commission in general , and mr monti , in particular , for its persecution of the incentives to basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid .    3.347304308776474
our discrepancy stems from the fact that the commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co - responsibility of our arrangement which gives our basque fiscal rules the same nature , foundation and aim as the rules of the member states of the union , and that they are applied in a general way to all tax - payers who , by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law , are subject to those rules .    2.610645797994955
mr president , commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .    2.9408502809034576
we need competition if there is the least unemployment , for a smooth - running healthcare system , for social justice , for high social standards , and , of course , we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest - quality products , equal market access conditions for all enterprises , and environmentally - friendly products .    2.5861915951895047
in other words , we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics .    2.588343232561518
i often have the impression , unlike the country i come from - former east germany - where economic competitiveness is UNK above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded , that very often the reverse is the case ; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics .    2.144142290909155
i say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this .    2.609171501526746
but a system cannot function in this way : it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand .    2.5646250438875553
i will give you an example : the european union was right to support the UNK steelworks in brandenburg , although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained .    2.5988645357149274
but these are competitive jobs , for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the federal republic of germany .    2.2796429532069937
anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle , by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time , would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region ' s employers that small and medium - sized enterprises are , of course , dependent on too .    2.3844261867106114
it goes without saying that that is not what the european union ' s competition policy is designed to achieve .    3.5217059733313616
if we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre - UNK of managerial economics .    3.1702902650143154
indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under - developed regions that will protect people ' s social welfare and boost purchasing power .    2.6167070246767246
to that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of demand - orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply .    2.5454946729171195
mr president , ever since i was elected to this parliament in 1994 i have never witnessed a report which had such anti - irish sentiments and UNK as the jonckheer report which we are debating today .    2.451890174858994
i would like to quote UNK from the report : " state aid per capita is highest in italy , germany and ireland . ireland clearly is in the lead when national and community regional and social funds are put together . "    2.387667545930358
i believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .    2.747750260332827
i find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation .    2.340585704009373
i should like to remind the member that the european union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus . this was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within europe .    3.2845031832207248
regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper .    2.6377737731099646
i welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top - up of 15 % for smes for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in objective 1 regions in europe post - 2000 .    2.2910625693663595
i remind mr jonckheer that irish companies or foreign companies in ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland european marketplace .    1.9277085532379385
no other member state is at such a disadvantage .    3.1083617647165522
mr president , the monopolies ' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in europe .    2.2366037480836987
the commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies ' ban to be unsatisfactory , something i would wholeheartedly agree with .    2.286364468171171
but opinion differs as to the solution .    3.0304461926171706
the commission ' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation .    2.1463504140584426
in other words , we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse .    3.3640711944623574
both i and other meps utterly reject such a drastic change of system .    2.303862621845835
i do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law .    2.4700273769414003
we would be changing the law to make it UNK again , which is something i consider to be unacceptable .    3.452870794989993
the commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions .    2.5018844868682133
competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , insofar as the provisions of article 81 ( 3 ) of the treaty on european union allow .    2.5542498925938135
the requirement to lodge applications in brussels will be dropped ; in other words , the commission will be completely in the dark in future .    2.751818297957963
this is unacceptable to my mind .    3.026621932674047
the commission ' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow - up supervision of the national authorities and member states ' courts .    3.5430091612435333
but if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a UNK UNK of competition policy .    3.7827808410372348
this is unacceptable in my view .    3.1608719208452007
it would weaken a key element of european policy .    2.582697670606056
the change of system in european monopolies law that the european commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned .    3.282200726703585
there are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition .    2.51384782301638
in any case , the commission ' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and UNK .    2.435428714321126
there was no majority for this at the time .    3.160557264416363
since france laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy .    2.6203742760694393
forty years on , this proposal has again been placed on the table and i am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies , to the detriment of europe ' s consumers .    3.298966143017321
i consider this to be unacceptable .    2.709158667154049
as the court of justice recognised in 1996 , the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition - related disturbances .    2.657702600781896
indeed , several years ago , this was the conclusion of a report that i compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the european steel sector .    2.9275842715389677
this is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses , even if this was in contradiction of article 4 of the ecsc treaty .    2.662581849662656
this indeed , is the aim of the sixth steel aid code , but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .    3.039192072020289
it is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and cases of company closure .    2.5170884006000023
in the same category of ideas , it is essential that member states fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the commission for the aid granted to their steel companies .    2.999631953824081
the commission suggests shorter deadlines .    2.497828631615136
i agree with this request .    3.0723706817191334
like the rapporteur , while i am pleased with the commission report , nonetheless i deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid .    3.5605895570264616
although the steel aid code is expressed in a very clear way , the commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the code .    2.717233737151471
in the interests of equality , either the code must be applied or it must be modified .    2.9565738809095854
finally , and in conclusion , mr president , with the expiry of the ecsc treaty , the regulations will have to be reviewed since i think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002 , and in that case i am in favour of a council regulation which will ensure security in this area .    3.6027270016434776
we therefore await , and i await , the european commission ' s proposals on this matter .    3.8059420426907082
mr president , i am also going to refer to the report by mr langen , which concerns aid to the steel industry .    3.1868755645972184
i agree with the rapporteur on two issues .    2.9951809928387028
firstly , i agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all member states and , secondly , on the need for transparency with regard to this aid .    3.9736271348811885
we agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that , despite the rules laid down in the sixth steel aid code , the commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that code .    2.9049307717979107
however , the thing that worries us most , mr president , is the decrease in prices , by 30 % , owing to imports .    2.704938485306196
the reason for this decrease is unfair competition from south korea and UNK , in the case of steel , as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid .    2.8299905720835437
orders in the steel industry and the ship - building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically , resulting in a loss of jobs .    2.258806676160947
i live in a region where the ship - building industry now has very serious problems : UNK .    2.4308828569115675
with global markets , we need global employment laws and global subsidies .    2.607478292583948
i know this is difficult to achieve now , but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers , here and elsewhere , and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries , here and elsewhere , it will be difficult to preserve jobs in europe and outside it .    2.8932581307023506
mr president , commissioner , director - general , i would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von wogau report : i welcome the commission ' s open - minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules , and to propose practical reform measures .    2.836800072502597
i congratulate the rapporteur karl von wogau , who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification , indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken , and UNK no UNK when it comes to the problems currently under discussion .    2.4715385253427713
the white paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection , discussion , and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves , the judiciary , the member states , and above all the smes concerned , that need to be clarified .    2.8055396075028565
competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be UNK because this would jeopardise the internal market and europe as a business location in a global economy .    2.9726981605262583
however , it must be " UNK " taking into account the principle of subsidiarity .    3.2243262196012954
i also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the commission giving up any of its responsibility .    3.178194245845501
in practice , only 9 cases were rejected , 94 % of the cases that the commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of UNK , non - legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines , which clearly shows that the work of the commission is subject to time - related , staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and eu enlargement    2.889589600974946
to conclude , i would like to tell you what i am expecting from this reform : fair competition and equal competition conditions , legal certainty for all enterprises , consistent application of competition policy , procedural simplification according to the principle of the one - stop - shop , coordination of the national - and to me , independent - competition authorities , close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the commission , along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of european competition and monopolies law , and i expect the commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the UNK of its tasks as the UNK guardian of the european competition policies .    3.1888197212433913
i am in UNK as to how the discussions , which were broadly based , will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal .    3.349778568884875
the commission report confirms that , with the exception of germany , state aid to businesses is increasing .    2.9454061405084575
the commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .    2.62470457977594
as far as we are concerned , we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes .    3.323995458890352
society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business .    2.2889106044011998
take , for example , the car manufacturing sector , where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24 % during the reference period .    2.284717969036197
with what aim ?    2.963247236153649
not to save jobs .    2.876978678613394
all these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies .    2.1492683096414593
not to improve working conditions , for in increasing production with fewer workers , working conditions are made worse .    2.275963896621276
did these firms need state aid to survive ?    2.7968838650660066
no , car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years .    2.5234555266724685
state aid is not only counterproductive because , as the jonckheer report acknowledges , it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another , but it is unacceptable because it UNK public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders .    2.9239107877661614
it is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout europe social protection is being reduced , public services are being abandoned , hospitals are being closed .    2.1024638434923744
in voting against the jonckheer report , i wish to assert the need for another policy , to wit , UNK all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff .    2.4874031884380203
mr president , today ' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market .    2.8024116269793917
in accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation has implemented articles 85 to 94 , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition .    2.6759555551858343
firstly , fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently , thanks to commissioner monti , there have been direct provisions , the code of good conduct in particular .    2.467205417895921
this has worked fairly well , but , as in the famous film UNK ' time goes by ' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances .    2.970893991985423
in this respect i have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions .    2.5113237979659186
firstly , it is necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rules .    3.6109514714449276
it is probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there are confused rules , regulatory UNK and rules that only lay down UNK legal concepts .    2.5085281060785465
this is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities .    2.6837693430003484
fourthly , and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed .    2.7249106173559987
we have seen this in the UNK seattle conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world .    3.411673459787091
the principle of competition must now be universal in its application .    2.7952447076437936
we must monitor compliance with environmental standards , employment standards , in order to prevent dumping in this area , and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid , which in many industries - as has already been said - UNK competition and destroys jobs within our own territory . to sum up , we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid , internal distortions by other countries , from being transferred to the international arena , in other words , through UNK .    2.785423611461545
mr president , commissioner monti , there is much that is good in mr jonckheer ' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors .    2.6773286992588154
first of all the report reveals parliament ' s single - minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions UNK .    3.288660855575474
many of the report ' s conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .    3.6119715423641847
for example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from member state to member state reveals the need for surveys such as this .    2.610826629044755
aid that is based on the self - seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages , thus UNK competition and leading to an ineffective , UNK division of europe ' s meagre resources .    2.377128625531688
the form the aid takes is important .    2.5208893249319417
forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported .    3.0416875833556842
for example , state guarantees , on which the commission has just publicised its position , must naturally be considered state aid , but they are , in my opinion , a better option than granting aid directly to companies .    2.9491648763168894
the report on competition policy further stresses the commission ' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency , which affects competitiveness .    2.4834459801259317
the european economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets .    2.788020584270737
if competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .    3.1316250269348234
competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non - material rights : we should not just be emphasising its social dimension .    3.761945865976548
the aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth , not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy .    2.829354326334402
mr rapkay ' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .    3.5693331797910712
in my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law .    2.3482809036249805
aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator , which will water down all the aims of competition policy .    2.5157754059582866
mr president , mr monti , the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the european union , not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years , but also with a forward - looking view to the union ' s enlargement .    3.7285155197980075
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr von wogau , for his commitment and i welcome his thoughts .    2.562864452770757
moreover , i would like to say that i appreciate the remarks and observations that professor UNK , chairman of the italian competition authority , sent me , and which i am sure mr monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration .    2.703128199249137
our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market , and , above all , to achieve consistency between the different national markets . as things stand , there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the english , italian and french markets .    2.7594614016952983
there is a large degree of state protectionism in the french market which is not found in the english market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in italy .    2.500004725867716
another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement , which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment .    2.273230306879989
in my opinion , we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed : small and medium - sized businesses , which bind the european economy together , and social protection , which europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy .    2.4477125863486187
safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade , pure and simple , and a system for improving people ' s quality of life .    2.934568261708795
a point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands , all of which must be protected .    2.8283873499239687
i hope - and i thank mr monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed .    3.108247444630896
mr president , competition is at the heart of the european internal market policy and is also its driving force .    2.8590184644467334
a free and open market can only exist by the UNK of competition , marked by clear , uniform rules .    2.893198494774666
in his report , karl von wogau manages to capture this very well .    2.5156980563734423
but europe is changing .    2.8964268467433065
the economies are growing , we are enlarging to 25 - 30 member states .    2.6051096947409262
the european commission will become UNK if it UNK its current policy .    2.8213898714560477
it is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy .    2.4668641214917724
this is not in question .    2.955042048105282
having said this , i still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation .    2.674929209144658
how will the commission , as keeper of the treaties , guarantee that decisions are taken UNK in matters of competition in london , UNK , helsinki and , soon , budapest and ankara ?    2.964131990329321
this is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented , and issues of competition will UNK towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given .    2.318646003051348
it is not enough to say that , in the member states , there is already 40 years ' worth of experience .    3.8701619151190356
in the netherlands , the competition authority is still in its infancy .    2.7351912276781483
this country has a very small market which , unfortunately , is often at the same time defined as the relevant market . this in contrast to germany , where a very experienced UNK is exercising its powers within a gigantic market .    2.460366955323854
the european commission ' s belief that , in all quarters of the union , legislation will , almost as a matter of course , be interpreted in the same way , is what , within catholic circles , we term " UNK , " and this is not allowed .    3.29973449813999
uniformity needs to be worked on .    3.4187129863522725
think of specialist , national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the european court .    2.46361662394797
this special court in luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise .    2.975202620070879
moreover , due to the immense economic and social interests involved , we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event , as is now quite normal .    2.9184419587395225
what is the commissioner ' s opinion of this ?    3.2518183951470174
i would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium - sized businesses .    2.2395866593034963
through cooperation , small , independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains .    2.905248978864363
it cannot be the aim of european competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses .    3.2283406806739365
moreover , regarding these small businesses , we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in , the UNK card , instead of an immediate red card , which will be a large fine and will threaten the company ' s very existence .    2.899425876785104
mr president , being the last to speak gives me the privilege , commissioner , of telling you that the majority of this house supports your initiative and has expressed a total , and , i believe , justified , confidence in you at the helm of this boat . but we all want to be UNK on it .    2.849516670546117
we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .    2.264391022564917
i therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform .    2.5712879959015402
the many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories .    2.944553776319483
firstly , there is the concern that some have expressed , in particular mrs randzio - plath , president of the committee on economic affairs , of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the treaty .    3.1011980479046164
i share that concern and i believe that this issue should be addressed .    3.048829078205092
secondly , we have the issue of companies ' legal certainty .    3.674965233122812
it is true , commissioner , that the commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty .    3.6188111867430584
we all agree on this .    2.662514771896895
but it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this house - that the european industrial fabric is composed of small and medium - sized businesses , and that the commission often plays the role of UNK , of legitimising the nature of the internal market .    3.314414823808219
on this point i will give my opinion on something which mr karas said .    2.6699733159830767
there have only been nine UNK .    2.515986157540314
but here i would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .    3.1527411737069144
how often has a lawyer with two companies and one project , in the face of a commission guideline given ex ante , changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules !    2.7115553099857577
this is therefore an aspect to be considered .    2.7256356117858305
thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of community law .    3.21592903729858
in this respect , the excellent speech by mrs thyssen cannot be improved upon .    2.331121275561222
i believe that biodiversity is good , as is cultural diversity , but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market , that is to say , competition law .    3.21862538746141
here improvements should be made .    3.0987099679459127
only in certain countries , germany for example , is there specialised jurisdiction .    2.8939179020819026
perhaps this is a promising UNK to explore , but we must also explore others .    3.24792695966168
what we cannot do , commissioner - and i would like to end on this note - is to give way , and give ammunition , to those who regard the european institutions as the property of the great and the good , of the rich , and not of the citizen , or the small and medium business , which , in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements , very late , with no real possibility of control apart from what the french call " le UNK du UNK " , that is to say , after lord knows how many years , when the court in luxembourg passes judgement , a court which we know to be inundated at the moment .    2.6442418517471262
commissioner , it is impossible to UNK the importance of this reform .    4.475671500323542
it transcends competition , it transcends the cohesion of the internal market . i believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of european integration , the meaning of the legitimacy of european integration .    2.8852848001027107
therefore , commissioner , we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation .    2.9006724040303844
in my opinion , mr president , this joint debate fully bears this out .    2.9744041882994967
we have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order .    2.5426313242854226
our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of european construction .    2.9745543035074467
i , personally , would sincerely like to thank mr von wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the white paper and for the quality of his report .    3.0367802228508136
i would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von wogau report into four groups . i do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the commission , but , on the contrary , fundamental contributions , since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome .    2.5983014683205026
the groups are : the efficiency of the rules , the risk of renationalisation , consistent application of the rules and legal certainty . i will take these very quickly one at a time .    3.3268321961152374
efficiency : i am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it .    2.948490572913154
the current notification instrument , ladies and gentlemen , no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - i would remind you that , in 35 years , there have only been nine cases in which the commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which , in the majority of cases , receive a simple comfort letter .    2.8553372083122057
the proposed system will improve the protection of competition , primarily because it will allow the commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions , also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in UNK out infringements , and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges , whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals .    2.7955245505271495
the question of renationalisation : first of all , although it is not really necessary , i would like to point out and stress , several times if i may , that the white paper does not affect mergers or state aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that , as far as regulation 17 is concerned , there is a risk of renationalisation .    3.347650986331535
of course we have UNK this issue , and we are still studying it extremely carefully , and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced .    3.6349226373044665
at the end of the day , i honestly do not believe that this fear is justified .    2.8437077366591894
the commission proposal accords the commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy .    2.483126940302657
the reform does not entail any reduction in the commission ' s activities , but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers .    3.3068198999213436
the reform will lead to a gradual development - i stress this because i was particularly taken with this term , used by mrs randzio - plath , and , moreover , i fully agree with it - of european competition culture .    2.792677825671975
so , the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being UNK and taking root in the european competition culture - where today various small plants thrive , and they are certainly not all the same .    3.193711190027286
the fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned , permitting greater use of community law , which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply .    2.4697801394994863
allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation , not renationalisation , of competition law .    2.8555041561746077
the question of consistent application : the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind , but i do not believe that it should be exaggerated .    3.3903687391432173
as with many other provisions of the treaty , articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 have , after all , been applied for decades by national authorities and judges , and i do not feel that this has created serious problems .    3.015988508800194
in a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules .    2.214489337418951
the commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provisions and through its decision - making practice .    2.5437770334873226
secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes , and the white paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation .    3.3494160193890674
in this respect , i would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by mrs riis - jørgensen and mr huhne of monitoring implementation .    2.411970083703288
this then is the idea of monitoring implementation .    3.0324752992377437
i must say that i find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .    3.2169982021473693
though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on , it is evident that we will watch very carefully how ec law is applied by national authorities and courts .    3.4891514454749055
that is why the commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application .    2.860551629372446
this goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns , mrs peijs .    2.4568933216586526
concerning mr evans ' point regarding the implications for businesses , it is important that the cost - benefit analysis should be seriously conducted .    3.0054476372036145
we have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost - benefit assessment for business .    2.4205867648541566
we will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation .    2.8045937278568296
there is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance . this was raised by mrs thyssen , mrs peijs and mrs palacio vallelersundi : the issue of smes .    2.6460590346318993
many speakers have underlined this .    2.830649418421395
the commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for smes .    2.7240126227838886
we are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for smes .    2.623904995539794
why ?    3.470363309296441
is this simply a political gesture ?    2.6857902215870557
no .    3.4048496541533226
in the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most smes will be covered by block exemption regulations , as in the field of vertical restraints .    2.5417882963474074
most smes have in fact less than 30 % of the market share .    3.1947535761671437
we have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since smes are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under article 81 ( 1 ) .    2.15595221419995
we are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of smes , and our white paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of smes , first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system , and secondly , by making article 81 ( 3 ) directly applicable , which will benefit smes in particular .    2.4317835446190426
the fourth group is legal certainty .    2.6106350469830257
mr evans , legal certainty is , of course - and i am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses , not just for the legal professions , although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of europe .    3.253876804110546
legal certainty is important for businesses : this is a subject , the importance of which the chair of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , mrs palacio vallelersundi , emphasised in her last intervention - and i am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market , including , in this case , competition .    2.8241001433478945
i am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons : by virtue of the direct effect of article 81 ( 3 ) , it will permit authorisation , without a prior decision , of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions ; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions ; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty .    2.3447334931689108
let me simply remind you that the court of justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982 , as you know better than i . this ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any UNK thereof .    2.5960151031750365
the white paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re - examined : the exchange of confidential information .    2.724514173770615
the guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion .    2.627417541698058
( it ) i shall now quickly turn , mr president , to mr rapkay ' s report , and i would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the commission ' s xxviiith annual report on competition policy .    3.4900838163805417
we share the same basic views but the rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully .    2.3226893647881477
i will mention only two , in order to be brief .    2.888151851981372
the first is greater transparency .    2.7255709722693537
as regards the international aspect of competition policy , i can confirm , mr rapkay , that the commission is willing to provide parliament with a report on this subject , to which mrs randzio - plath has also drawn our attention . we have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant american , canadian and japanese authorities as regards competition policy , and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the world trade organisation .    3.144652701457341
mr jonckheer , i would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on state aid in the european union .    2.843989597833426
i will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly does not mean i do not consider it important .    3.173933743266172
it has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition ; i am therefore not qualified to give an opinion , and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the intergovernmental conference .    2.664352074608739
with regard to your suggestions , mr jonckheer , you already know that my staff , who , although short - handed as usual , are fortunately highly qualified , are working hard to produce the register of state aids and the state aids ' scoreboard ' .    2.3062700643907528
i am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey , which , according to the scheduled timeframe , should be being drawn up by the staff now , in january , and for adoption by the commission in march 2000 , to see whether the latest trends are confirmed .    3.1678431007501873
mr jonckheer , mrs thyssen and mr UNK raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of state aid .    3.5685440452144728
i can only say very briefly , that we are actively working with them on a practical level : they are making preparations , they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities .    2.4475635716680726
i can also say , in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which , as you know , i share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental state aid .    3.408577694177191
in connection with the issue of state aid , i would also like to take up one of the points raised by mrs riis - jørgensen , among others regarding repayment of illegal aid .    3.578240428422795
in the near future - and i can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules .    2.968903072547411
i would like to say that , as we know , the commission report on state aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure , pursuant to article 95 of the ecsc treaty , but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector .    2.920271918782212
in respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector , which will come into force in july 2002 , we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied , and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this .    3.3464870728749228
when we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form , i will be happy to present our viewpoint to you .    2.76685142620618
so , mr president , i will walk away from this debate , for which i am very grateful to parliament , in the knowledge that we have the european parliament ' s intellectual and political support , which appears to come from all sides of the house , for competition policy , its basic appreciation for the work the commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future .    3.5999890075070926
i am especially grateful for all of this .    2.988032760633283
we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the committee for economic and monetary affairs , and , at a more general level , with parliament .    3.156149259808602
in this regard , i liked your term , mrs palacio vallelersundi : we must all pull together , UNK in the same direction .    2.807284951293679
competition is not an end in itself , as mr rapkay rightly pointed out , but it plays an extremely important role in european integration .    3.418094992250785
as mr von wogau said at the start of the debate , at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept : it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy .    3.5194508444858896
i would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social , as well as economic , role in the european integration process , as it has done in the past .    3.364551423667013
thank you , commissioner monti .    2.5703670415414965
the joint debate is closed .    2.607557207215761
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.6677986406930794
protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests    3.4392407398699434
the next item is the report ( a5 - UNK / 2000 ) by mrs theato , on behalf of the committee on budgetary control , containing parliament ' s recommendations to the commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests .    2.712789082704331
mr president , year after year we learn , mainly from the european court of auditors ' test reports , that money is lost to the budget of the european union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage , mismanagement , and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud .    2.2988895484924123
for some time now , these abuses have meant that parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the european taxpayer ' s money , which , when all is said and done , is what sustains the union ' s budget .    2.692627436045162
particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud , to detecting it , punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening .    2.5287795842312115
creating uclaf by means of the task force and setting up the anti - fraud office olaf were important steps , as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the community and on local monitoring .    2.8395669476412717
the union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed .    2.4588813960445606
so far , efforts on the part of the commission to ask for UNK obtained money to be returned only had limited success .    2.838038456245546
it is for the member states to undertake criminal measures .    3.234891498921847
since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross - border violations against the union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the member states .    2.4215758555854805
then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual member states , together with protracted or even UNK requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement .    3.1707688686439415
what is more , the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the european council in 1995 did nothing to change this .    3.03233890077219
for it to enter into force , it must be ratified by all 15 member states .    3.404843477001366
after five years only four have done so .    2.682635137587566
this state of deadlock , which threatens to undermine the credibility of the union , has inspired parliament to initiate the setting - up of a european public prosecutor ' s office .    2.648158189587833
there is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority , rather the aim is to equip the union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests , that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity .    2.697059919508782
we are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised .    2.6545265997741985
the concerns of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , as UNK in its position , together with those of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , will also be taken full account of in this process .    2.8251409330131905
we would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of olaf and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the rights of individuals .    3.1929149055306723
in addition , we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the union ' s financial interests , and in which main principles are firmly established .    2.898340596674997
i support the proposed deadline for the commission being 30 september in a proposed amendment .    2.8336017522398453
the second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings .    2.413780391687076
the commission ought - and i have also amended this deadline to 31 may 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the commission , for coordinating and UNK the legal investigative body olaf .    3.0203385212762166
the existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the director of the agency .    2.2496177541124625
the proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks , which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by olaf into activities which are to the detriment of the union ' s financial interests , and to olaf ' s relationship with the national authorities .    2.6910118576127955
there is no question of this UNK the administration of justice in the member states .    3.012517431537918
the court of justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts .    2.938615715563432
in addition , we call upon the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to take up debate on the establishment of a european public prosecutor ' s office for the protection of the financial interests of the union , where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well - known experts , the so - called corpus juris , and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared .    3.0290622112180365
further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so - called five wise men .    3.086223704417671
the commission , mr barnier , mr vitorino and several member states are equally receptive to the idea .    2.9132458778199264
i call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote in favour of this report , which the committee on budgetary control adopted with a large majority .    3.2247409832197307
we can set another example here , to the effect that parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular , fraud , and to UNK out punishment where necessary .    3.4284224813165123
mr president , i am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and i congratulate mrs theato .    3.750299952870635
i believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well , and the result , which we have received today , is moderate and UNK in a very delicate area .    3.6020724230567427
this moderation and UNK is particularly necessary in the implementation of article 280 ( 4 ) .    2.709002412051426
if we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand , least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought . the treaty is a collection of complex articles .    2.3494791227800333
however , this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm UNK to win such a prize .    2.5772817423170586
at the same time , it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the community ' s financial interests , as mrs theato has explained very well .    2.977156777167921
we are all aware - and this parliament has been the UNK champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the community . but be careful .    3.99628986822267
as the french say , " UNK UNK pas le UNK UNK UNK ' UNK du UNK " [ let us not throw the baby out with the UNK water ] , that is to say , in the protection of the community ' s financial interests , we must respect , on the one hand - as mrs theato has said - the competences of the member states , but also other matters which affect the citizens , which affect the essential guarantees .    3.4773268448879517
the conclusions of the theato report safeguard them perfectly .    2.5864159090500944
therefore , in my capacity as president of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , and , of course , as an mep , i hope that a large majority of this house will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the commission .    3.85744139140866
mr president , this , as mrs theato said , is a critical report .    3.2449467063502015
it is a report that has been proposed by the committee on budgetary control and it is an own - initiative report .    3.60767090692682
we need to do something about it .    2.9417849479445075
some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the member states - and let us not forget that the member states are responsible for implementing about 80 % of the eu budget .    4.434083362928535
a lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the convention on the protection of financial interests , and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done .    2.984331467751109
we need to take this responsibility seriously .    3.1225424547731575
we need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the european union .    2.7952184302442737
the question is : who UNK ?    2.714744595490925
that is where we really get into difficulty .    2.5406246406609596
whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that UNK so many frontiers ?    2.534017254208795
the proposal to set up a european public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one .    3.3097406745086237
we are all aware that an all - out federal approach and a situation where a european judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people .    2.2116312690352746
but the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the igc to start discussions .    3.128063052656347
of most importance to parliament , as the guardian of the budget of the european union , is how to deal with people who work within the european union institutions .    4.008640301468297
at a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal .    2.696271113246791
people need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted , and that is not the case at the moment .    3.3635774157727996
the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by mrs palacio .    3.3146952812459443
i should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the commission should tackle this question .    3.1330965682905907
we are aware that it is a delicate debate .    3.576911803040653
we know that the commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties .    2.896565691018948
can i just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here , no commitment to a federal european public prosecutor .    2.9251639603335677
but there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable .    2.985895498665243
mr president , i would like to start by congratulating mrs theato on her report .    2.152884386814771
i just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage .    2.2928700090467946
judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months , this could well be the case .    2.882812065363529
we all know that , in 1995 , it was agreed that the union ' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law .    3.3270737184261105
but the member states failed to cooperate .    3.5013195293440638
this is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , i think .    2.90425450707979
it is now possible , on the basis of article 280 of the treaty , that the commission will take new initiatives , and i would like to suggest to the commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity .    3.643098603080621
unlike the previous speaker , who has now disappeared , my group is strongly in favour of a european public prosecutor .    3.361027463636381
my colleague jan - UNK UNK , will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter .    2.8170531716539458
i think what we need is , at european level , to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible .    2.67732818786902
i myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .    3.5191482647550343
this , i thought , is no longer permissible , certainly not at the moment .    3.159118927808274
i would like to make one general point on politics . whatever we may say about the european elections , the low turnout is a fact .    2.404540617687913
we can improve on this by punishing crime in europe quickly , and this must be done at european level .    3.0179206784558694
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur .    2.4210725289969206
mrs theato ' s report may help to restore confidence in european institutions .    2.8604760070207633
i believe that is something we are all desperately in need of , bearing in mind the results of the last european elections and of the level of turnout .    3.4325705517409735
yet , every year we have the same problem .    3.3016629110974236
the court of auditors UNK its report , which UNK the member states on account of various incidences of fraud .    3.4104996488781025
so far , however , the european institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here , to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied .    3.069480164109904
it is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year .    2.321715827054797
i believe that mrs theato ' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the european institutions take steps to ensure that european money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here .    2.7232417581653072
it is important that after the first step , which has already been taken , i . e . forming olaf from uclaf - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for olaf , in order that olaf too might operate within a secure legal framework .    2.531774081437285
we will need the european public prosecutor ' s office for this , which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees , also for UNK .    3.3437333985480477
having said all that , i must say that unfortunately , my group will not be voting for your report as a united front .    3.3550483221116396
i hope that the debate will convince a few more people .    2.536557893382835
unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of european institution that undermines subsidiarity .    3.0537712290456165
but i will do what i can to see that mrs theato ' s report receives more support .    3.180908987178677
mr president , we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled , even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by parliament to the council to amend the treaties , so that effective protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests can be guaranteed .    3.6875905761160936
the establishment of a european public prosecutor ' s office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the union is doubtless a good idea , but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a european legal system .    2.667913248379471
reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are .    2.464595220236605
in any case , this idea must be encouraged , and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a community corpus iuris in the treaties .    2.6735839567708997
therefore , on behalf of my group , i would like to say that we support the theato report ; i nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the igc agenda .    3.267051108373121
mr president , mrs theato ' s report on the protection of the european union ' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a european public prosecutor .    2.824997251551122
this proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state .    2.8494495877367836
but the idea of a european public prosecutor , on the other hand , aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters .    2.729499635901496
moreover , this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally UNK reforms .    2.4280444241427306
according to the theato report , the european public prosecutor is needed , in particular , in order to better support the inquiries of the anti - fraud office , olaf .    3.484605890361977
at the same time , however , we see from the van hulten report under discussion today that the european public prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a european union court .    3.1156270433665543
in this way , a small european reform may hide a medium - sized one , and a medium - sized one may hide a large one .    2.8151816688999065
not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one , as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a european criminal law and then , why not a european minister of justice , supervised by an extension of the powers of the european parliament ?    3.127325286475612
i therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform , which appears to be quite specific .    2.883846954306786
in the final analysis , we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a european public prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form , organised around a superstate .    2.436472616831119
the union for a europe of nations group , on the other hand , wishes to see a polycentric europe with nations linked in a network .    2.502009593100523
and such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities , for example , and the creation , if necessary , of national teams UNK in offences involving community finances .    2.812650275654976
so the legal framework , mr president , is already in place .    3.8715760019987515
it is fine , in principle .    2.807077263175412
it need only be fine - tuned .    2.4262727316429284
mr president , mrs theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason .    2.119306910476095
public opinion , although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows , is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution : a european criminal code with crimes against the community and a european prosecutor - general .    2.2000953546573196
mrs theato probably forgot to include a european prison now that we have the fbi , the european police , in the form of olaf .    3.470339686919951
all this would be established by two regulations , one for the public prosecutor and another for the criminal code . the regulations would be adopted pursuant to article 280 of the treaty , i . e . based on secondary law , whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible .    2.3782159393354596
and indeed there is a twofold shift .    3.4678572935885756
firstly , the classic eurofederalist ideological shift , a single market , a single vat , a single diplomatic service , a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor .    2.398931321693701
all this to combat fraud worth less than eur 1 billion , while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the generalised system of preferences , free trade areas , customs presents to UNK and the billions lost to the fourth resource , gdp , as a result of the budgetary UNK pact .    2.22107410134809
next we have the UNK shift : the UNK europe of the north , the europe of the UNK , UNK and UNK , wishes to inflict its moral order on us .    3.4529364178193713
mr president , it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the european union , more so these days than there used to be .    2.9778652631651275
the fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of europe ' s citizens .    3.1529534813735154
the credibility of the efforts we make here in parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future .    2.3128656187607635
this does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes ; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law .    2.289400004640253
the intergovernmental conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this .    2.7537179730723436
now it is , of course , possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the member states and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity .    3.253958744846553
there is no doubt that i myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at european level .    2.8347303224711315
when it comes to the demands made on the intergovernmental conference agenda , it is the call for there to be clear UNK of competences that should take centre stage .    3.0716753984915455
now that is not a contradiction , since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law , as detailed in recommendations i and ii of the report , is actually about taking action in the eu ' s own interests , which , as far as that goes , does not damage the legal interests of the member states ; on the contrary , it protects them , at least indirectly .    3.533479911708136
the compatibility with the various national systems of law , as confirmed by experts , shows that criminal law is another area where europe has a great deal in common , for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned .    2.861281370809498
taking these aspects into account , i consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as proposed , and i also consider it necessary to the further development of olaf .    3.3610835852100758
mr president , will a european public prosecutor be able to abolish UNK fraud involving eu funds ?    2.681059177123539
i do not believe so .    2.5270521254924483
on the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .    2.7834486503755604
an alternative to the european public prosecutor could be eurojust , as proposed at the last summit .    3.2866045472044236
in the way it is structured , eurojust should correspond to europol and support investigations into crimes .    2.3410143807485984
it is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .    2.9372521759595216
olaf , europol and the treaty on UNK and mutual assistance in criminal matters should be used fully and , when the fraud convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the member states , we can also achieve a lot with this .    3.0094283970056113
i nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most member states should still not have ratified this agreement .    3.072437236053346
it is simply too bad , and i can well understand why people are becoming UNK and demanding that we have a common european public prosecutor ' s office instead .    2.927731942457732
however , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an office .    2.5580156853652376
it is , after all , only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law . UNK per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence .    2.4054419353727283
instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .    2.8227203346741403
we should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and , especially , change our practice .    2.3591106538165256
at the moment , article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used .    2.2155469234899154
should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we UNK into constructing grand new institutions !    2.2584709432936765
mr president , we all want to do something about combating european fraud .    2.898568759051545
but the question is now : is the european union doing anything about it as well ?    3.4191499961456593
the answer to this is that we know very little about this .    3.500310456450841
the tampere summit was about combating crime .    2.452862380284062
everyone was supposedly pleased about it but , in reality , we have made little progress .    3.2460452980170746
there is no european anti - fraud legislation in force because the member states , as was stated before , have not ratified the treaty texts submitted .    2.7656077362070093
so a great deal has to be done in this area .    3.9715204859748967
and what exactly should be done ?    2.943568033581669
two things , and mrs theato ' s report clearly spells these out .    2.6870099509243266
firstly , the same penalty clauses regarding european fraud must apply in all member states of the european union .    2.4765436089609936
so , unification in this small area .    2.4274916068372656
secondly , we should indeed set up a european public prosecutor ' s office with two tasks , firstly to assist the national public prosecutors , helping bring criminal proceedings in european fraud cases and , secondly , to supervise europol and olaf in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision .    2.233862451041715
the european public prosecutor ' s office is nothing to be afraid of .    2.770993241709769
i feel there is a lot of UNK going on .    3.291495184081076
it is , in fact , something very positive .    2.8769282850662368
just like europol . europol , involving police cooperation , does not UNK above the national police forces , but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces .    2.5429884276055237
this is exactly the task which a small , limited , european public prosecutor ' s office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosecution stage .    2.5688603799995935
parliament supports this .    3.0667749920286025
the committee of wise men supports this .    2.7003713853971494
i urge the council of ministers and the european commission to do the same .    3.814203440508577
mr president , i want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris .    2.860745893268824
i would very much like to support what mrs morgan said on this issue .    2.384897505335454
corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .    2.708699164305195
the idea of a european public prosecutor on the continental UNK model with overriding jurisdiction throughout eu territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in ireland and the uk .    2.431160959908773
the idea of a single criminal code and the european public prosecutor is something which member states have a right to be informed about .    3.7099809817027527
indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the eu budget .    2.5273999684897808
but when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in san UNK - to a very select UNK of 140 jurists , with no media invited - the president of the european parliament at the time , mr gil - robles gil - UNK , said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend eu competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity .    2.6345495145556774
we need a public debate on this .    3.019146627592211
we need the member states and the citizens in the member states to be properly informed .    4.119121691012223
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in ireland and the uk needs to be addressed .    2.9233794589958175
there needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .    3.5869591779029117
it is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the member states of the eu without any proper public debate .    3.068786029199327
mr president , on behalf of the italian radical members , i abstained on this text in the committee on budgetary control , because i share the concerns that have been voiced , in such an authoritative way , by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important : common law .    2.6927108639626245
with this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue , since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for community fraud to be UNK , to be crushed .    3.776924880469998
nevertheless , the way in which our committee intends to see this text through , with the drive and UNK desire of its chair , mrs theato , will not be without its critics .    2.9077817082698094
another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law .    2.696692556158137
article 280 of the treaty allows the council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud .    2.718701249163611
nevertheless , we are left feeling slightly UNK that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality , without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this . that is to say , they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system .    2.6762454134796587
we wanted to express our UNK as regards these points by abstaining in committee .    2.7218451007444218
mr president , we need to speak our minds on this subject in the european parliament , during the plenary sittings and in the committees , even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture , the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed .    3.3469440034705036
we find ourselves dealing with some very serious events , which in the past seemed to be the norm .    3.263584824477123
today , something has changed , at least in terms of mechanisms , and especially as regards monitoring , but we are still not satisfied , particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a european public prosecutor , crimes , fraud , the UNK of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one ' s office at european level .    2.884976307902234
i feel that we must clearly safeguard the community ' s interests , its image and its relationship with taxpayers , who are an indispensable and essential part of community life .    2.669077511186661
for this reason , it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests , and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual states .    3.388353603061761
in this respect , we are faced with the most sensitive issue : what role would a european public prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems ?    2.738185525174865
this issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms .    2.586831053998065
today , we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country .    2.1312878030189104
mr president , i would very much just like to add to two particular points .    2.614648433430744
firstly , i would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of member states , although i am very much in favour of having such a debate , for my regular viewing of british television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are UNK up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home - grown legal system .    2.7370931575262234
sometimes it is worthy of UNK and merits discussion , but i UNK .    3.430936169612109
the point i want to make relates to mrs theato ' s report .    2.861837626214286
i believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the european union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences UNK as european criminal offences - we have become UNK in UNK .    2.9922921139754344
i am referring to recommendations 1 and 2 .    2.5538950602301433
after all , there is no longer mention of a european public prosecutor , rather , for legal reasons it has now become an independent , european authority , or " body " to quote mrs theato .    2.5577528318114133
we obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .    3.2068532570418053
we also face difficulties with regard to offences .    3.055097769782221
nothing has changed there .    2.83882743327762
as has always been the case , there are offences that transcend european offences , as it were , or at least there is the potential for them to do so , and these might include money - laundering , receiving UNK goods , and forming a criminal organisation .    2.8262069150877402
as far as that is concerned , i believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome .    3.192642888955562
what parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the commission and council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this UNK state of affairs .    2.890435981698698
mr president , for years , parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests .    2.5996798970940627
frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the convention ( and of the protocols relating to this protection ) which , five years after being signed , has still not been ratified and has still not come into force .    2.484837316863357
on the other hand , more pro - active attempts , such as olaf , which is currently operating , have not UNK legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights .    2.8727130187014662
the proposals in mrs theato ' s report seek to encourage the commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection , under criminal law , of our financial interests , which would criminalise certain activity , specifically fraud against the community budget . these proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently - needed uniform criminal law for the whole community .    2.833365661765852
at the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by olaf , without UNK the administration of justice by each member state and under the supervision of the european court of justice .    2.8634737798548335
finally , following on from what was agreed in tampere , the report UNK the need for a european public prosecutor . this issue has been brought once again to the fore by commissioner vitorino ' s timely decision to ask the igc to include in its agenda the creation of this new role , which everyone considers vital .    3.0208527851453746
we should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions , by protecting the union ' s financial system with a substantive and procedural european law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the community ' s economic life .    2.7706691757833317
nevertheless , it raises some very basic questions .    2.260960882344153
is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying , in legal terms , the creation of a specifically community - wide criminal law which , although it might be called subsidiary , will always clash with the practice , and in certain areas , with the traditional , separate criminal law of the member states ?    2.760352783350666
as there are doubts , would it not be more advisable , from a political point of view , to put the reform of the legal system on the igc agenda , and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the union ' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the european public prosecutor ?    3.43938076559736
surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ?    2.818698998034357
mr president , the eu is now exposed to tough scrutiny .    2.7215151048294137
confidence in the european union has been seriously damaged .    3.6767900212758025
to remedy this , vigorous efforts are required .    2.436053958827876
we therefore welcome increased resources for olaf so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently .    2.3772880894722612
it is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the union ' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few member states .    2.841967727778751
we therefore think it only right that the commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework .    2.8668909552114688
on the other hand , i am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common european legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime .    2.638245610020229
in the present situation , i am therefore sceptical about the idea of a european prosecutor , which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty .    3.6931545727806423
we have more confidence in eurojust , where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate .    2.1407058842744684
the major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the union but , rather , that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered .    2.5423922893918443
the challenge for the commission and for ourselves is , however , to find the right mix .    3.8387288528845045
the mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old - fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which , through an exaggerated supervision of detail , prevents the development of a modern administration .    2.3274225834777837
we therefore welcome the aggressive approach of mr van hulten ' s report .    2.400090050646414
the main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision .    2.737259058844129
our experience of modern administration tells us that openness , decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision .    2.0528732237193967
the major challenge is , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law .    2.6365133086698975
this requires staff training , more modern recruitment methods and , above all , openness and public control .    2.328301316642666
being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities .    2.7724265819463727
mr president , rapporteur , restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the european institutions and in european politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us .    3.4201164894873863
the commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this .    2.3485137152901285
parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .    2.8902263836991717
on behalf of the commission i am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do , in terms of creating legal bases and UNK institutional change , to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the european union .    2.7976238514732645
on ratifying the amsterdam treaty , all member states stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the european union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment .    2.5817076412406808
yet as things stand , only the first four member states have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995 .    2.5471280117585557
the commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation    3.721618803140825
a legislative act , a directive , in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money - laundering or UNK , and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective , may enable us to take a major step forwards , and i will therefore advise the commission to examine this step with all due haste .    3.2978360247412972
olaf , the european anti - fraud office is one of the most important instruments the commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud .    3.239817683422197
accordingly , the commission refused to put up with the fact that both european banks , the ecb and the UNK , contested the right of olaf to include these two institutions in its investigations , UNK their independent status .    2.997479471978692
this is why the commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting , and i hope that parliament approves this step .    2.406680854520939
the second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by olaf in the various european institutions .    2.4645780806241753
it is the task of the monitoring committee for olaf , which was set up at the same time as olaf , to safeguard the independence of olaf , however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by olaf .    2.862701758564215
i am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .    3.5879158684439556
in other words , there is a loophole here which must be filled and i will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on .    3.0830361557258
there is one thing i would ask though : i believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for olaf from leading to the UNK that olaf does not now have enough authority .    2.9517100546910733
no , there must be no undermining of olaf ' s authority , and neither do i think this was the rapporteur ' s intention .    3.1403419943548023
as such , i would ask you to give olaf ' s work your full support , also in its present form .    2.885013194111996
thank you , commissioner schreyer .    2.2997364261725206

heaton - harris ( ppe - de ) .    2.6147545326219896
mr president , on a point of order i should like to ask you for clarification of the rules of procedure : namely rules UNK ( 2 ) and UNK ( 4 ) . these are both about voting .    2.5212055747633553
is it not the case that on votes other than roll - call votes , the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then , if there is some doubt , should we utilise the electronic voting system ?    2.3883986153428034
that is quite right , mr heaton - harris . i put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call .    2.2670600548994866
you know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if members of the house request it .    2.323775124184613
in this particular case , i can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on .    4.420403573240999
mr president , i was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general .    2.1925041721014553
it is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system .    2.2867298352429293
i was wondering whether this is the correct procedure .    3.5591981242146744
i know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ?    2.5632190114859403
mr president , as far as the second reading is concerned , the commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by parliament .    3.2623957401061427
the commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it .    2.1853053522357357

explanations of vote - own resources    2.8524856816510957
. ( fr ) the european union is apparently financed through four own resources .    2.626358476836235
since then , community vat fraud and distortions in the calculation of gdp , the UNK basis for the fourth resource , have had a UNK effect on the yield and justice of community resources .    2.7160150629251403
since then , of course , this europe with UNK to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is , but which it refuses to see itself as .    2.283642938164476
this can be clearly seen in the regulation before us .    2.804178028643279
it shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources , the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the commission .    2.5650162890131454
furthermore , the new advisory committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the UNK member states .    3.419095423582412
this is a long way from UNK such as the " community criminal code " , the " european public prosecutor " or a european police force , with olaf .    2.7213649072541353
there is as yet no federal european tax .    2.366975111636674
all the same , a europe with 25 members will be wanting a european tax on income , if not on profits , or the tax on co2 to finance the budget for 2025 .    2.6714648257322655
koch report ( a5 - 0105 / 1999 )    2.7421552610321664
- ( fr ) it is with great satisfaction that i welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods .    2.0628053122102767
in recent years , the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably , increasing the risk of accidents .    2.832517229627042
some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation .    2.4826114984980223
it therefore proved necessary , in the context of establishing the internal market , to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention .    3.0478267324694484
directive 96 / 35 / ec was a response to this requirement .    2.585973358212964
firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the UNK and UNK operations related to such transportation have been obliged , quite rightly , to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention , whether road , rail or inland waterway transport is involved .    2.599130859256494
in order to facilitate achieving this objective , directive 96 / 35 / ec provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training .    2.256377256201617
this professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation , regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport .    2.5024986509356957
while this represented significant progress at the time , the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem .    3.012813674834372
it therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised , high - level training of safety advisers , but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training , with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different member UNK .    2.8566406975259566
the commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised .    2.8515818995207107
it outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies .    2.3971694337860323
parliament voted in favour of this text .    3.2589202194719538
it did , however , table a number of amendments , most of which were adopted in the council ' s common position , particularly regarding the need to draw up a UNK and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the ' specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body ' .    3.411171990326318
in order to be realistic , i further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force .    2.460035037157822
i shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users , to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods .    2.3230241514279792
koch report ( a5 - 0104 / 1999 )    2.6076691454456244
last october i expressed my views on the hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail .    2.6666053149720796
the views i shall express today are not far removed from those i had then .    2.1747251388776805
essentially , my opinion is as follows : i deplore the fact that , in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods , we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment .    2.7150722273520125
i shall point out that a directive on the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 january 1997 .    2.636533593954075
this included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 january 1999 .    2.6243642990561415
in line with the usual procedure , it is the european committee for standardisation ( cen ) which puts forward standards in this area , and they are then integrated in to the european agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road signed in geneva in 1957 ( known generally as adr ) , applicable throughout europe , whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the eu .    2.473058277315707
the cen has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted .    2.9282599240695397
consequently , the commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short - term solution to these problems , rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements , as should have been the case !    3.481748142094627
this is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail , except for the fact that a time limit had been decided .    2.870253132236443
right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the cen will be in a position to put forward practical proposals .    2.83387993710827
until then , there is really no point in member states amending their national regulations .    3.201785122946822
the report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted , and grants states the option of adopting or applying alternative standards .    2.1576366204795914
they may , therefore , continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation , where there are no applicable european standards .    2.608264313290231
in offering this explanation of my vote , therefore , i wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern .    2.549348833973625
schroedter report ( a5 - 0108 / 1999 )    2.7850387115779136
mr president , i wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the schroedter report with regard to regional development .    2.4442205272270314
i would urge both the member states and the commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in europe .    3.0328492597586125
not only the difference in income per capita but , above all , large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern .    2.5295978258580187
despite the fact that the community , through the structural funds among others , UNK considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in europe , these disparities continue to exist .    3.0924870086608625
i therefore wonder whether the community should not have a more drastic change of tack and , based on very strict evaluations , change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively .    2.460981811426438
mr president , in relation to the schroedter report , i am aware , and have had it confirmed to me by mr barnier , that the rules on additionality concerning structural funds apply only at the level of member states and do not apply in a UNK and transparent way inside member states in favour of self - governing regions such as wales or scotland .    3.217609436668836
i regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs .    2.77238847186877
i hope we can revisit this issue at a later time .    2.737716508271551
- the schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of eu structural funds in europe for the period 2000 - 2006 .    2.974123403160847
i believe that this is particularly important as eu structural funds are always spent in a manner which UNK the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision - making process for the spending of such funds .    2.7240777785358365
as a member of the european parliament for the constituency of leinster , i have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom - up schemes supported by national eu funds .    3.2525142433781236
i believe that the irish government and the european commission and different eu governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities .    2.7382014306603457
i believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision - making process for the spending of european structural funds .    2.6794104486305694
for example , we have seen the success of the leader i and leader ii schemes in ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of ireland and within europe .    3.180859266294549
the leader iii scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year .    2.4587288087049792
the leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public , private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long - term and sustainable jobs in small and medium - sized enterprises in rural areas .    2.3324579604504483
this is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit .    2.3682551250396497
the european peace and reconciliation fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in ireland .    2.5374789519548915
once again , there is active participation from groups from the private , public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region .    2.1520989633560728
during the next round of eu structural funds 2000 - 2006 , other eu initiatives such as " equal " and " urban " will be operating .    2.3686033752380937
these initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best european structural funds should be spent .    2.6692964314368255
the rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new eu structural fund plans and programmes .    2.799872456146025
they must promote a decentralised , efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities .    2.5897759637008373
this is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national , european and local funding .    2.351757335938103
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) this report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .    2.8460911101226634
in order to reduce disparities between regions , of course .    3.3805160310393
but more especially because , even though at first sight the european market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy , it may also be a source of inequality .    2.9698661289314416
it is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the european social model , which we are all in favour of , and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .    3.5908758738802384
this is a real political objective , alongside economic and monetary affairs , drawn up in collaboration with member states , regions and local communities , with the commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show member states what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming .    3.095785092924321
this is why i shall support this report , despite regretting the fact that , for UNK reasons , the european parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist member states , regions and local communities in the programming of objectives 1 , 2 and 3 .    2.8444865429616804
moreover , i would also urge this house to take into consideration the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs , adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion , support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy .    3.066437998506734
mrs schroedter ' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid .    2.8424232088242065
it highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved , chiefly those involved at a local level , who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems , hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships , which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned .    2.690890560211609
this is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the member states , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid .    2.8889807057654817
in order to do so , the monitoring committees must be opened to include members of the european parliament , associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society .    2.874431106421775
these guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of community structural aid .    2.4987646906747827
amended again as such by the schroedter report , they are a step in the right direction .    2.541150978958104
they also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006 , but that is another subject .    3.4972698289672954
in the meantime , let us support this first step .    2.780665109717784
- this report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid UNK out by some member states .    2.5612005470419383
although i wholeheartedly support this aim , i would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .    2.6775820317368177
in my mind , illegal state aid amounts to little more than state - sponsored social dumping .    2.2839691666340376
we all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by UNK UNK industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments .    2.643568589134772
if we are to have an effective single market that makes european industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all europeans , then we must have a level playing field .    2.5171665680401145
illegal state aid , by contrast , destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment .    2.5334828715266333
there are , of course , cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping companies restructure .    2.7162876947472525
in all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the european commission gained .    3.0671129432546027
whether we are talking about beef to france or about UNK to industry , eu member states must not be allowed to flout the law .    3.084375957000402
i enthusiastically support the report ' s proposal to publish a " scoreboard " showing the amount of state aid per member state .    2.6228827249004243
countries that claim to be at the heart of europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and UNK and their hypocrisy revealed .    2.6346187481101526
member states cannot be allowed to proclaim european solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private .    2.500398728795486
i take some UNK encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in europe appear to be falling .    3.0637626491341132
much remains to be done , however , and i call on the commission to be far tougher in UNK the subsidy UNK of europe .    3.725203729980772
.    2.489189446364389
( pt ) the commission ' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the structural funds and the cohesion fund . it is therefore crucial that the european parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity , given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective member states .    2.884106317094971
unfortunately , the european commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and parliament ' s position on the programmes for 2000 - 2006 does not carry much weight .    2.9966958498960294
it is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions , of which the portuguese regions of the azores and madeira are examples . this must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion .    3.4555710973968967
the truth is though , that the commission ' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives .    2.994553994530348
on the other hand , it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity , and supporting the social economy and solidarity . there must also be support for rural development , for small and medium - sized enterprises , for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas , specifically in the field of social housing , with a view to achieving sustainable urban development .    2.4954701054671435
.    2.489189446364389
( it ) while article 158 of the ec treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the communities , we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled , or rather in some cases , as with italy ' s objective 1 zones , paradoxically , disparities are being exacerbated , particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural UNK to community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures ; despite the changes to the rules , the community structures have not yet been streamlined .    2.7531796935914024
in the first place , if administrative procedures are not simplified , it will be hard to attain community objectives on reform , with a view to greater efficiency and concentration .    2.640915392306624
in this respect , the commission document has shortcomings , as it makes no recommendation to the member states to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities , and for their funding , execution and monitoring .    3.017821071227094
smes , micro - enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still " weak operators " , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some member states , including italy , are major obstacles to accessing structural funds .    2.363025284342673
a considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time .    2.611121754670852
in view of this , in accordance with the decision on the 97 / 99 guidelines ( UNK report ) , the commission should have consulted parliament in time . in fact , it found a sort of convenient excuse in the UNK of the programming stage in the member states , and it published the guidelines back in july 1999 , even before the new parliament had taken up its legislative duties , thereby preventing parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines .    2.821019367039506
this is why the mid - term review , provided for under article 42 of regulation 1260 / 99 , will be of considerable importance .    2.3312000909458894
in general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent .    2.633876895253665
they merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely UNK with the strategies followed in community policies , and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement , so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities , or candidate countries .    2.8878514346285584
that said , the differing approach adopted in the guidelines , which are not geared to geographical objectives , but rather to policy areas , can be considered as positive .    3.265767159297631
while in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions , we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the objective 1 zones allows , in practice , a policy of integrated interventions , for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary .    2.7843860115667542
we could then , theoretically , also support the commission ' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the member states , with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there , provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level , but guarantees real help for those zones - and i stress this once again - which , owing to a whole string of converging negative factors , have not yet harnessed structural funds to sufficient levels , with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could , in fact , amount to a negative intervention .    2.5488051811948234
the guidelines , as adopted by the commission , are very limited because , instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance , they are providing a shopping list of possible measures , a shopping list which , as it fails to set priorities in UNK order , could even put the member states on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration .    2.8293224285065595
we could say that , in this state of affairs , we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring - UNK ever - increasing urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .    2.9756149810585786
there has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument , which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and , moreover , would accord proper status to local bodies which , being independent , could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly , and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the structural funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency , concentration and administrative reform .    2.8112273604282842
rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in , by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration .    3.1706414157140523
it is now a fact that in order to attain this goal , rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs , which are no longer solely connected with agriculture , in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also , for instance , in rural tourism , sport and cultural activities , environmental projects , smes , services , and so on .    3.1710526009186775
a genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the UNK of coordination between the esf and employment strategy . the fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000 - 2006 programme period implies that the member states really do need " guidelines " .    2.8871644465814037
i must also stress that once again the commission is , in fact , UNK the issue of practical action on equal opportunities .    3.613093318325849
in conclusion , the document is not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspects is disappointing .    2.6088341015155065
berend report ( a5 - 0107 / 1999 )    2.849109421012132
. ( pt ) we basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union .    2.5309731334011856
we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues .    2.3405306808318356
firstly , and as the commission itself states , it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita gdp between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new german länder in calculating the community average from 1991 onwards .    2.817866055523058
this obviously caused a slight reduction in the union ' s per capita gdp level .    3.0782533763248154
we also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment . this consequently imposes the need for new development strategies , with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area .    2.4955423296055192
this situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the member states , which is what the report proposes .    3.210340226304458
finally , but no less importantly , i would like to refer to the rapporteur ' s proposal that , in future , this type of report should also include , amongst other issues , an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each state .    3.2357670149322617
the huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same state mean that there is a need for an in - depth assessment of this issue . this kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee UNK to regional ( and other ) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each member state .    2.3479244209883166
. ( fr ) considering the employment situation in the community and the european union ' s declared ambition to UNK attack unemployment , the analysis of mergers carried out by the commission should take elements other than competition into consideration .    3.1985754566289755
as an example i would give the restructuring of abb alsthom power . a sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout europe is visiting strasbourg today .    2.134375942976185
the management of abb alsthom power , following a merger carried out in june 1999 , announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries .    3.0399470863165994
this damaging situation for employment raises many questions , particularly regarding the information given to the european works council , in existence since 1996 .    2.6997152947371936
it suggests that the community directive on european works councils must be updated and strengthened .    2.3622084746386904
it also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment , the environment and consumers into consideration .    2.8032161305428405
since the report of the committee on economic and monetary affairs did not go far enough in this respect , i abstained .    2.932209529958183
.    2.489189446364389
( pt ) by proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in community competition policy , the commission is UNK to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion . issues of mergers and state aid however , still remain within the notification system .    2.752737187088283
the position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy , moving towards applying community law in national courts rather than at the european court of justice , and even aims at having specialised courts .    2.489960325464714
this partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for member states .    2.4183297890397464
- ( fr ) the commission ' s white paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing articles 85 and 86 of the ec treaty ( now 81 and 82 ) certainly does not propose any " renationalisation " of competition policy , as some members of the european parliament fear .    2.6098800968843827
but it does , at least , make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the european union .    3.024877807005204
in fact , taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade , and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new member states , the commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements , and to apply competition rules at member state level in a more decentralised fashion .    2.5774510840570586
the most remarkable thing , in my view , is the message conveyed by this proposal : that the commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and UNK that this necessarily , and virtually automatically , requires reform of the centralised system .    2.902622366684339
admittedly , this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling .    2.68749534496229
indeed , the white paper envisages that the commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .    3.2414559169619146
moreover , the von wogau report , which the european parliament has just voted on , supports it in so doing .    3.1653703941830904
but at the same time , one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended .    2.3538207837927585
it is a quite different europe which is taking shape in the long term .    2.8616787314838206
is this not , indeed , what is so distressing to some socialist members of the european parliament ?    3.2547017758741346
the german social democrats voted against the von wogau report because , in their view , it might break up european policy on competition , which is to say , in plain terms , attacking the UNK superstate .    2.9361284847953435
curiously , a number of employers agreed with them , preferring the european " one - stop " system , which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally .    2.6585985735139235
indeed , this is one advantage of the present system .    3.8011277582593594
but , on the other hand , the wider view must also be taken , namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may , in the long term , lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account , and this will be of benefit to everyone .    3.408595320859051
rapkay report ( a5 - 0078 / 1999 )    2.9157915153228604
the members of parliament from the UNK UNK party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on european competition policy .    3.3735724446248607
competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other , which constantly takes the form of layoffs , factory closures , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity .    2.418470605361333
we see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in europe proposed by the corporation abb alsthom power .    2.6304886713037745
eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the european union , despite its being one of the UNK regions in the world : these are the results of this competition which the european institutions intend to promote .    3.6804331524472906
the commission ' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the european market is ridiculous , for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful UNK or devour the weakest elements .    2.6498813573180366
this is UNK most of all in social terms .    2.828250375152711
the european commission ' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes .    2.661713529373889
there is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment , nothing to protect employees , nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still !    2.8546036549001292
we acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the european institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions , and still less of improving them .    2.692996903697984
- ( fr ) in voting against this report , we are acting as UNK for all the men and women who in seattle and throughout europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic .    2.725771050358606
we are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services , in memory of the victims of the paddington rail disaster , killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations .    2.536144467355197
whether it is a matter of the balance of the UNK , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity .    3.4695538198581506
do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy ?    2.381709092745582
we are convinced that the opposite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive .    3.5252953755615755
excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criteria of efficiency ?    2.3971536081620064
finally , after seattle , do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the wto ?    2.7047082745520306
only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such UNK .    2.249635599744154
jonckheer report ( a5 - 0087 / 1999 )    2.9339606925642974
i am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the eu , and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report , and also that the directorate - general for competition will be making information , both general and specific , publicly accessible via its website .    3.061477593294914
i am happy with the rapporteur ' s treatment of state aid and i congratulate him on this .    3.25471114418728
there is too often a tendency to criticise state aid UNK as a measure causing distortion in competition .    2.340086169388296
admittedly , an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union .    3.044063506922453
however , as the rapporteur pointed out , such aid is occasionally essential and may , in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm , make it possible to contribute to sustainable development ( article 6 of the treaty ) , services of general economic interest ( article 16 ) and economic and social cohesion ( article 158 ) .    2.661031836854486
clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the european commission .    3.3490006305275846
the aid which union member states allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of eur 95 billion in the period 1995 - 1997 , including 40 % allocated to the manufacturing sector .    2.269061611211283
this aid is considerably less than the previous period , 1993 - 1995 ( a 13 % drop in the total amount and a drop from 3 . 8 % to 2 . 6 % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) .    2.4307937367871144
this downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new german länder .    2.871461821944499
like the rapporteur , i deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid .    3.071376543440792
the european commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible .    2.365412513957726
it must also cooperate with the member states in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which is to say in time for the UNK report .    4.259296671334909
i think it would be a good idea if the commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per member state .    2.704138964191585
i also deplore the fact that the european parliament has been totally excluded from the advisory committee on state aid .    3.104211555102417
in order to compensate for this situation , the european commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us .    3.205273452546955
i shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which i feel is particularly dangerous : the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one member state to another , with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the eu .    2.9469971810565467
this is why i should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries .    2.8216677278378266
langen report ( a5 - 0073 / 1999 )    2.869354864564047
in the important debate on competition this morning , i expressed my views on mr langen ' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth steel aid code .    2.437663563860664
just as the court of justice recognised in its order of 3 may 1996 , the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation .    2.2579852507937197
establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable , even though article 4 ( c ) , of the ecsc treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry .    2.8566454451484335
this , indeed , is the purpose of the sixth steel aid code .    3.14943912047924
it is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure .    2.6727298435944413
in the same way , it is vital for member states to fulfil their obligation to report to the commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings , as stipulated under article 7 of the steel aid code .    3.1441156784830113
the commission suggests that member states submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six - month period or , at least , annually , without the need for UNK .    2.84404658833702
like the rapporteur , i am pleased with the commission report , but i did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid .    3.9298483579727748
although the steel aid code is expressed in a very clear way , the commission has , on a number of occasions , authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code .    2.890645651378586
in the interests of equality , there are grounds to either apply the steel aid code strictly or UNK the code if the commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment .    2.608339864544938
finally , we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ecsc treaty .    3.1016017570982632
the aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002 .    2.3662877149095785
my feeling in this respect is that only a council regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code .    2.5649591114515653
for all these reasons i voted in favour of the langen report , and i now await the commission ' s response to our requests and demands .    2.88574364676159
( the sitting was suspended at 1 . 05 p . m . and resumed at 3 p . m . )    1.7551858440363792
oil slick off the french coast    3.0906202500428237
the next item is the commission statement on the oil slick off the french coast .    2.4164103333204405
mrs de palacio will open the debate on behalf of the commission .    3.183723035735456
mr president , i shall be speaking on behalf of the ppe - de group , but also as an elected representative for brittany , and i am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events .    2.8910533255682083
together with mrs grossetête and the ppe - de group , we tabled a motion for a resolution .    2.3918303813846284
i am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion .    3.1355395491830387
the erika shipwreck is a truly european issue , firstly because it is UNK and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in europe , with extremely serious consequences for tourism , people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists , and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a european scale .    2.5894884615645486
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the american coastline , and why ?    2.3284142741341913
because the americans managed to learn their lesson from the exxon valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the oil pollution act , which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities , as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable , and is more restrictive , and , more especially , more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and , in particular , the existence of the american coastguard .    2.572897875758997
if , i repeat , we had had regulations of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occurred .    2.9832943896718174
this is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed , particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners , in this case the oil tanker charterer , from any liability .    2.635229219381498
well , if the charterer is UNK , then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for .    2.8615667004934626
the regulations must therefore be reviewed , and i thank you , commissioner , for highlighting the inadequate features of current european regulations .    3.1304598477417866
you told us that rina was an italian classification register recognised by the commission .    2.4615199036920234
what are the conditions for this recognition ?    2.891881689098419
what guarantees are there of its reliability ?    2.416974583082084
you are going to commission a fact - finding mission .    2.811956110797078
we await the outcome with great interest .    2.6457425488472888
inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within european ports must also be UNK up .    2.6250438067651225
there is a paris memorandum in existence , let me remind you , which stipulates a minimum for inspection , that is , one in four of the vessels putting into european ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned .    2.534796134299438
this obligation is not respected either in france or in many other european countries .    2.538458249188709
why not ?    2.9864373439465504
what conclusions has the commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw ?    2.374273279319788
i also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for , in this case , the oil company .    3.197903428201405
if the charterer ' s liability entails a financial commitment , then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent .    2.2002562522064824
finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of european facility comparable to the UNK who supervise the coasts of the united states .    2.8685152396479316
firstly , i would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team .    2.2100169221314085
this disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area .    2.572778132158818
here we are here again in this parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster .    2.716963402647521
i could UNK off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this parliament but i only have three minutes .    2.478329047175622
how many more UNK do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the european union , not just certain areas of it ?    2.8131394138504526
how many more UNK are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which , as our resolution points out , causes far more pollution than any erika - type disaster ?    2.0678039549295817
while i recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal UNK standards , we are still faced with what our late colleague UNK UNK used to call ' ships of shame sailing in and out of our european union waters : rust UNK badly UNK ' .    2.297204714171812
we need the member states to act quickly and decisively .    3.1857766234909004
we need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety .    2.5170295296029748
the erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods . just as the sea UNK , just as the UNK did .    2.5820718713441444
it is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .    2.485176120140039
my group ' s sympathy goes out to the people of brittany who have seen their area UNK by this disaster , just as my group ' s sympathy went out to the people of west wales and to the shetland islands on previous occasions .    2.610235142193735
is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement UNK to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again , later on this year , discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag - of - convenience tanker sadly goes down UNK its crude oil all over the sea .    2.2359175378971026
the time for resolutions has passed .    2.6896949637566006
sadly , i fear , the council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster .    3.324940277596879
mr president , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .    2.7818431214520656
in reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea , but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future .    2.375719533364516
the " erika " incident was serious especially for the people of brittany most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of europe .    2.496806067614211
some say that it is the worst accident that has ever UNK the bird life of this part of europe .    2.9046557659740704
the royal society for the protection of birds believes that as many as 400 , 000 birds , perhaps mainly UNK , may have died .    2.362875755369482
the pictures many of us will have seen of oil - UNK birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic .    2.1539434735408705
we all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying .    2.4626644746788346
we need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the " polluter pays " principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced .    2.4280135779334513
i agree with every word the commissioner said in her remarks , but the question is , how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes ?    3.300836276049079
as a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this parliament in a year , were a similar incident , just as devastating , to take place , if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice .    2.7092493419836043
the thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully .    2.2702467943007165
mr president , commissioner , i have brought you a small gift . here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the french island of UNK who wrote to me as follows : " with every tide , the UNK is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the erika .    2.28419417360277
with every tide , the volunteers , members of the armed forces and UNK remove great UNK of this UNK , UNK , black tar .    3.2739094953747316
when will we see a return to UNK and the end of this devastating accident ? "    3.3111958201535683
indeed this disaster involving the erika , like that of the russian vessel in turkey , moreover , is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi - tech technology is available .    2.5339494987723357
it is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the amoco cadiz disaster , despite our saying at the time and many times since , " never again ! "    2.362684092541309
it is , of course , the responsibility of policies , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .    3.1976758235482685
we absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again .    2.461419005595688
but , listening to you , commissioner , we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992 , i believe , the commission and parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee .    3.1062441840190935
indeed , we must say and keep saying that the erika is one disaster too many .    2.8498609028828805
this is why it is essential , as a matter of urgency , for the european union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes .    2.680411787385883
we should be aware , for example , that shell and british petroleum refused to use the erika to transport their oil .    2.807221089330615
why , in these circumstances , is the liability of total as charterer not recognised ?    3.18210378588676
your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance , at last , of the ban on degassing at sea .    2.4901608632155106
a european inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently .    2.1750377036930555
in addition , it is also essential for the european union to undertake to reform the imo , as a matter of urgency .    3.6184201697546747
what point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?    2.21379140995502
finally , a UNK thought for all the volunteers , nature lovers and bird lovers , who UNK and UNK are coming through to the aid of the oil - covered birds , organising rescue operation with the means available .    2.5246743556817774
i can testify to this remarkable work .    2.409399710864149
you are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick , which is a major ecological disaster , practically unprecedented in scale .    2.871649243363389
in relation to this , you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces .    2.729937076687212
and , on this subject , commissioner , you did not mention how the commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats .    3.9415145657171515
once again , there will be no clearly defined party responsible .    2.7452999764334205
in the meantime , it is nature that is taking the UNK , as always .    3.481974827971564
mr president , my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster , affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment .    3.0430378092516985
let me , in this connection , welcome the presence in the visitors ' gallery of mrs UNK - le UNK , spokesperson for the oil slick action group " UNK UNK " , made up of men and women from the french department of UNK .    2.5847214595128625
many volunteers from france and other european countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field .    2.7784976556367504
as the european parliament , we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and , at the same time , demanding tightening up of the quality criteria , on the european and international scale , of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport , stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders .    3.022353016396978
our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers .    2.8967108233069885
among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year , 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more .    2.481440281155806
this is no longer tolerable .    2.749939041649481
next , we have flags of convenience .    3.492656186899512
according to the international transport federation , over 40 % of the ships UNK in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience , the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety .    2.5745452660007184
this is no longer tolerable .    2.749939041649481
finally , there is the lack of transparency .    3.8617846268890346
everything is done to make the lines of responsibility , the identity of the owners and real decision - makers as UNK as possible .    2.6899429116634552
this is no longer tolerable .    2.749939041649481
in all these respects we must ensure real , significant change , including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards , including the mandatory double hull , on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of member states .    2.2540683331543017
we must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea - worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels .    2.0358446735837847
finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused .    2.9996009739484046
i am thinking specifically of total - fina in the present instance .    2.5367458449712683
this is an approach , mr president , which the european union can develop with regard to the international maritime organisation .    4.162685400485768
in so doing , it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which , in this instance , is awaiting clear , tangible action .    2.9319380546138807
mr president , commissioner , as a member for the french atlantic coast , for vendée , i should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the erika oil slick in the face of these disasters , caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us , but by a crime .    2.7843223314343364
in this emergency , in this ordeal , we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity .    2.538933694061347
what the stricken populations are waiting for now , those who have lost everything , particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism , those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come , is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused , but for the UNK to now be set in motion to ensure that their present UNK serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future .    2.4679703475674835
quite clearly , we are now paying the price for our lack of concern .    3.260567101060835
because our states , with the blessing of the community , did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know - how to disappear , we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships UNK our waters under flags of convenience , UNK according to the short - term interests of the multinationals .    2.667469002790603
it is absolutely essential to put an end to this UNK of irresponsibility , irresponsible charterers , UNK shipowners and lenient certification companies .    2.1864228640295744
obviously , such matters should be handled at world level , but the current international regulations of the imo are far from adequate and are far too loose , and neither our own countries nor the community have tried UNK to make them stricter , despite previous disasters .    2.2882690298178145
admittedly , there is the international oil pollution compensation fund , UNK , but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be reviewed .    3.267263513049962
the question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the imo .    2.7738354522563697
it is up to the members states and the community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this .    3.510369474102878
let me remind you that the erika was sailing under a flag of convenience , that of a state applying for membership of the european union .    2.570713709899454
in addition , there are community directives , but they are seldom applied , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspectors .    2.7415856568107313
this omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency .    2.5571988016939238
a directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years , but it is making very slow progress .    3.234023994772164
the commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings .    2.3073785677958245
the date when the commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again . it is now scheduled for july .    3.078829642426248
this must be brought forward .    3.47127725108429
the terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict .    2.805355055637028
i shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities .    2.425153974395441
firstly , the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally .    2.482533452070779
the best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil , criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select .    2.5290002938655074
secondly , the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely .    2.2857912876561857
thirdly , a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to community waters must be established in the near future .    2.4975161185697288
this could be of a maximum of 15 years of age .    2.6926985199802393
if we do not obtain a framework of community regulations which is sufficiently clear , strict and trenchant , then those member states that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory , in the same way that the united states succeeded in learning the lessons of the exxon valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters .    2.510261146469077
thus , the erika was refused access to american waters .    2.47858053080055
if the european community had done the same , a great disaster would have been avoided .    3.265164559412898
let us ensure , mr president , commissioner , that this time we really do learn the lesson , even after the media UNK and the shock of this house have died down .    2.979812048695277
mr president , torrey canyon , UNK UNK , UNK , amoco cadiz , UNK , UNK , so many names we remember with horror .    3.041580475534099
and now the erika .    2.9298342440111864
twenty one years after amoco cadiz , this umpteenth oil slick , the seventh since 1967 , shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers .    2.09279331823225
the atlantic west coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react , for their capitulation to the multinationals .    2.0744711721250613
it is hard to understand why the french and the europeans allow something which the americans refuse to accept , and why europe , normally so quick to pass environmental legislation , has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety .    2.226962963112211
and this is the result .    4.358781107303161
the erika , a vessel flying a maltese flag , a UNK rust UNK , classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers , has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline , a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the amoco cadiz .    2.112096780091289
as an elected representative for the loire - atlantique region , unfortunately , i can testify to this .    2.886523008786009
they are the result of human UNK .    3.52817693354756
what we have here is an ecological disaster .    3.165326837254919
only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that .    2.1749489889406
it is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism , fishermen , oyster farmers , shellfish farmers , people who make a living from the UNK UNK , shopkeepers , etc .    2.6624870894385753
the erika disaster must be the last in the series .    2.992128050008339
first of all , we must shed some light on this shipwreck .    2.6951822684187894
why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get members of parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the commission ?    2.921614560251622
next , as a matter of urgency , we UNK pass legislation , firstly , regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported .    2.527513449610314
in fact , according to the experts , the oil the erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast .    2.5042885622006827
we know what actually happened .    2.5828548445668567
next , reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in france for vehicles more than five years old .    2.1350987764398184
we must regulate the use of flags of convenience , make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials , work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover UNK at sea .    2.519380408669033
this would be a minimum requirement , i believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .    3.717037339982775
non - UNK vessels must be denied access to european waters , the responsibility of polluters , shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the " polluter pays " , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing , thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required , an appropriate " natural disasters " budget line must be re - established for member states and , in the meantime , community aid released on an exceptional basis and the french departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for structural funds .    2.4025144645340344
i have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the edd group .    3.151515916225859
mr president , in the course of the last few years there has been a UNK of serious tanker disasters world - wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning .    2.603472830028759
it is particularly bad this time , not least because it has affected a major european state ; an incident which could happen again at any time .    2.4532304118582715
we urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks . the 15 clearly do not suffice .    2.3555367003479857
these guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things .    2.372552486351019
no tanker or UNK fit only for the scrap UNK must ever put into any harbour within the european union again . all those involved , including the transport UNK , are responsible for any ensuing damage , and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances .    2.507599520273278
this is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation .    2.6039881385974497
however , we must aim higher in the long - term , let there be no mistake about that .    2.5434672292437455
in other words , we need real cost - effectiveness for our entire energy supply system .    2.391881783843679
mr president , may i start by saying that i would like to thank commissioner palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .    2.6306365563649
many thanks for this .    2.9215880511274586
this also means that , in any case , i have a great deal of respect for the UNK note which she sent on 10 january but also for the action points which she announced today .    3.134922156767882
the erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and european level , nature and the environment come off second - best .    2.277783374005606
the damage suffered , also in ecological terms , cannot be expressed in money .    2.4387008149290454
hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management members .    2.528570519819114
what i learned is that , actually , there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision .    3.32980021894204
could i highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the commissioner ?    3.145467056619225
first of all , the port - state control , according to which 25 % of all ships require inspection .    2.7472515020427375
i think that this 25 % should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place . so this 25 % should be increased .    2.531256993106323
furthermore , if a ship is no longer UNK , not only should the facts be examined , but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used .    2.627237438433862
but this is not in place .    3.8319415791096954
mr president , i would welcome some action in this area .    2.5432557574462575
finally , as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned , some members have already mentioned just now that , since 1999 in the united states , ships should in any case be double - hulled .    2.9796044872941954
in my opinion , we should look further into this point , and i also think that the marpol treaty , which comes into effect in 2001 , should be looked at very closely .    3.1246282249737205
mr president , i would like to take a brief , critical look at the accession negotiations with malta and would like to express my gratitude to , and admiration for , the many ngos that have at least rolled up their UNK in order to save animals .    2.8036394558946642
mr president , we have already had this discussion so many times in the past .    2.8732888801750214
we have achieved nothing so far , and we have been unable to reach agreement within the european union .    3.6022101634636576
that is why i will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today , and what the commissioner has announced here , actually leads to legislation being produced ; in other words , if you all go and say to your heads of government and ministers : " you must push this through in the council of ministers " .    2.815633011375692
allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe , which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods .    2.634535291269763
so what are we to do now ?    3.1314170626557805
i have no intention of talking about past events ; rather i want to look to the future .    2.7063026771904113
i will tell you a few things we should do .    2.9729390218173584
of course , we need double - hulled vessels .    3.1092205647709643
that goes without saying , but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term .    3.1936944446226843
so what do we need to happen immediately ?    3.592005396284404
we need technical testing of ships , that is obligatory technical testing every two years , and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate .    2.493834338423397
we need this at european level and internationally ; we need something like a tüv , an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in germany , which is compulsory every two years .    2.39188821005061
if you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle .    3.0262838907614054
this is what we need for ships .    2.928507992123323
thirdly , we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports , that is in every port of the european union .    3.0289284703402553
any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port , regardless of all the port charges .    2.4730206561037797
we must reach agreement here , in all the european union ' s ports , from UNK , through to rotterdam , to UNK , cuxhaven , and wherever ships drop anchor .    2.9279578545303453
fourthly , we need the UNK to bear liability , and not just to the tune of a derisory usd 12 million , but to the value of at least usd 400 million , to be covered per insurance certificate .    3.0762890075694496
we also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability .    2.2781335897354023
we need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability .    2.443034416906777
this would be a marvellous exercise in supervision !    2.809658263600305
i can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability .    2.0857577352631558
in the fifth place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the european union , and incidentally , that includes the candidate countries .    3.023362733232741
last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future .    3.419217080505221
environmental standards will be a recurring theme .    3.311368061645189
i would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports .    2.558723897510485
the unions will have something to say as will industry .    2.513975348414259
a long memory will serve us well , ladies and gentlemen .    2.7094547431724143
i am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement .    2.5684479676217915
just you go home and say : " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date " .    2.4063638740127513
we need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports .    3.1717813382624405
we need to have a long memory when we say : " for once we are united , at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned , and will not play one off against the other in the european union . "    2.8901370905276957
mr president , mrs roth - behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts .    2.509183714402002
we have now obtained a first - rate UNK of a variety of measures .    2.902181330022587
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led ?    2.8525273630386114
i would compare the situation with an earlier generation ' s introduction of the UNK line , a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels .    2.2485129712548266
i consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that mrs roth - behrendt speaks about , the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in europe have brought up for discussion .    2.343198176548898
we must also critically examine the classification societies .    2.5087807780131195
i do not think that we can accept their procedures .    3.037553405672235
we need independent procedures and procedures involving public control .    2.299754875972766
finally , i want to say that , when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment , there are units within the commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards .    2.918026751476099
within the commission , the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing .    4.497097770095272
it is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment , which are in keeping with the commission ' s guidelines , cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards .    3.0848253890678503
mr president , we shall vote in favour of the gue / ngl group resolution because it UNK total - fina ' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and i endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of UNK vessels should be prohibited , or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers .    2.4521002669582246
i shall only add that it would be the least that total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick .    2.898992848148488
how can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations , and indeed many others who , in order to make more profit , take the risk of making the world UNK ?    2.6239965550020137
how is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to UNK the names of the erika ' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality , without governments reacting ?    2.476143765797675
the crux of the problem is that all governments , and indeed all the european institutions , acknowledge the right of major corporations such as total - fina and its UNK to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment .    2.715856771967929
they accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks , even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions .    2.1927921844607736
in these circumstances , even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations ' capacity to cause damage .    2.299104075221245
mr president , i am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies .    2.31259879424344
however , we must stick to the facts .    2.8613388817369136
the ship erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years .    2.760716340246404
the answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken .    2.553236375666768
i have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the member states do not have enough money to undertake the controls .    3.4319197698197876
i cannot accept this .    2.7360944019944706
if the member states decide , in agreement with ourselves , that 25 % of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available .    3.055147722070165
the controls must also be carried out in such a way that the UNK does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire UNK missing , rather there must be materials testing , for this ship obviously broke up on account of material UNK .    2.7072878302174246
this can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous .    2.4019222952837547
it should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial , but include materials testing .    2.53950149950443
if it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies .    2.400380247598637
mrs roth - behrendt , we already have a tüv ( organisation for safety testing ) for ships in the form of the classification companies .    2.261310979459735
you will be familiar with some reputable companies , our french fellow meps will be familiar with some reputable companies , but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements , and these must be struck off the list .    2.3331570490985043
finally , we should make it quite plain to malta that if it wants to become a member of this community then by the time it UNK it must apply a standard in respect of UNK and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements , for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up !    2.9778398753119273
mr president , commissioner , the erika sank near my home and is still there , with 20 000 tonnes in its hold , the fate of which we are waiting to discover .    2.4434533657433732
it could have sunk anywhere .    2.700333566188941
it happened to sink there , and brittany , where i come from , should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula , and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after UNK .    3.027593776700807
my first thoughts are for the 26 indian UNK , who were saved but of whom nothing has been said .    2.4713266664236384
there could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means , above all , men ' s lives .    2.671109527714666
by now they are far away .    2.7334420633815752
so we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the amoco cadiz ; a wreck on the north coast , a wreck on the south coast , a wreck on the west coast .    2.3350782639839456
things could well continue in the same way .    2.674531291775234
commissioner , as time is very short , i would like to pick out the seven points which we feel , and you have already mentioned some of them , are essential to work on : double - hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports . in particular , we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public , as currently , we do not have access to them .    2.84967905975437
then , sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 member states ; they should not be different , but the same throughout the union .    3.052987927612552
we must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience , not because they are necessarily bad boats , but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones .    2.4681867134804762
we must improve information on all of the world ' s ships , but provision has already been made for this . we must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them .    2.9257570781547093
with regard to this matter , i would like to know who owns the erika , because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing , but there are always real shareholders in the background . where are the erika ' s owners ?    2.845135314030485
perhaps they are in lovely UNK by lovely beaches , getting a nice UNK .    2.2128723244615065
we would like to know their names and their faces .    2.6400063868616623
finally , there must be improvements in the training of UNK .    2.9046744800473348
in our society there is no such thing as zero - risk , but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety .    3.0432872923836998
mr president , i welcome the statement from the commissioner .    2.510353681548151
having spent a lot of time at sea myself i am well aware of the sea ' s power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential .    2.3377382577142156
i would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker erika .    2.7577061630274966
this has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources .    2.91884525455405
it should be noted that the oil industry , through the international oil pollution compensation funds , regards itself as liable under the 1969 convention and its 1992 protocol , for over 90 % of the estimated cost of this incident , or some usd UNK million .    2.152020451470392
this suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners , to the flag state and the inspection authorities to UNK their share of the responsibility .    3.2252469422908896
however , before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations , let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented .    2.8207804553775286
better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals .    2.133871924804983
in that context i support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection .    2.250008537333214
i support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels ' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions .    2.4342738340428705
they are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .    2.483843502648644
mr president , i would like to thank my socialist colleagues , mainly in the committees on transport and the environment , who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry .    2.6891221495689646
because , as well as the irreparable damage to the environment , the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry , the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry , to the conservation of marine resources , and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover .    3.09393785464039
it is no accident , commissioner , that the affected areas are always those european regions which are least developed , those which UNK out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which , in the majority of cases , do not have any other resources .    3.0292696526719864
these are the same areas , commissioner , which already have to put up with the UNK activities of certain shipowners who empty the UNK of their vessels off their coasts , without any control whatsoever .    3.0888386665948895
i come from a region , galicia , which has suffered similar accidents in the past .    2.6247962075867743
brittany and galicia , two european ' lands ends ' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks .    1.974569861924989
i therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways .    3.1127218662082554
on the one hand , by asking the commission , within the scope of aid to the fishing industry , to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected , and also by asking them to demand , of international bodies and of themselves , tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience .    2.6973539720619533
in this regard , the current process of negotiations on malta ' s accession to the european union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously UNK the oil tankers which sail under its flag .    2.7320991478471943
on the other hand , prevention is essential .    2.3557448595210952
portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea .    3.087976198620122
i would ask the portuguese presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at european level , using all the means at our disposal - technological , structural and socio - economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future .    2.657877150434974
lastly , mr president , i would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities , who reminded me of old times when , as the then UNK , i lived through similar situations .    2.7021441283080403
we must thank those who , while defenceless and lacking in resources , have UNK UNK against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions , the marine ecosystem and european fishing stocks .    2.3345756844379983
mr president , as chairman of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i should like to congratulate the commission , and in particular commissioner UNK de palacio , for her reaction to this incident , which has really shaken the whole of europe .    2.7903462118987683
we , as the committee on transport , are prepared to discuss the commission communication on the question of safety at sea and , of course , we are likewise prepared to discuss , at a later date , the legal implications of this communication .    3.749037103071634
in addition , i should like to make a number of comments :    3.4205858614161673
first , the commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of rina , the italian shipping register , because we need to know if community law was applied .    3.0875081419856434
that should be the starting point for our efforts .    3.1137075241114465
secondly , apart from the shipowners ' liability , it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers , for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and , of course , for restoring the damage .    2.7701044069543257
once we have done that , our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified .    2.7107095150712053
however , this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine , which is an important sector of the economy , covering as it does 1 / 3 of transport requirements , which is why our reaction needs to be measured : strict , but correct .    2.793127586663014
i have no objection to examining an amendment making community law stricter but , as other members have stressed , we need to start with application , because there is already a legal framework at european union level and we must not lose sight of that fact .    2.793912989968428
this legal framework is fairly advanced , at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the member states , under the supervision of the commission , should endeavour to ensure that community law is actually applied .    3.148888087566785
mr president , commissioner , i believe that the unfortunate incident involving the erika should in fact , as others have said this afternoon , constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the european union where , since 1967 , there have been UNK accidents involving large oil tankers ; more than one every two years .    2.791763834691963
the economic and social damage , which we have spoken about today , in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources , is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the community institutions .    3.0351314168891705
commissioner , i would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented .    2.917893810011198
i trust that these measures will , in a few months , give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive , possibly - which will put an end , once and for all , to these 21st century pirates , who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea .    2.6892331007486154
i would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken , which was mentioned by the commissioner and some of my colleagues .    4.139621682932038
i am referring to the double hull , which consists of two layers of steel , with containers divided into two tanks .    2.1233910999297567
commissioner , there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so - called ' ecological hull ' in which case , in the event of an accident , the UNK UNK the containers and , as a result of pressure , the oil is transferred to other tanks .    2.975862686671264
it is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries .    2.539619182577159
i believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard .    3.050237525818028
any cost - benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm UNK to persons and the environment by these accidents , is bound to support this approach .    2.4070851484621665
mr president , commissioner , i think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us , after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings , finally to produce a joint resolution .    2.519368601760317
i think that given the dramatic circumstances , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill - advised and inappropriate to hold several votes .    2.725012392027012
i think that it is quite obvious , and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the erika disaster , that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport .    2.738360175522326
public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area , common UNK , a common rail area and a single market , but not a common maritime area . i therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms .    2.936837587239637
the commissioner has suggested three main UNK which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation , in which we can set standards .    3.1420163133934436
i have also noted , to my great satisfaction , that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty , or the UNK groups are calling for europe to regulate , and i think that this is in fact the right level to take action .    3.0784990935140804
we sometimes regulate things which could , by and large , remain subsidiary .    2.217485246747468
in this area we must respond to public opinion .    2.9271951109323378
this is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are , when all is said and done , on the global scale merely a peninsula .    2.77269640228763
therefore , once our legislation has been brought into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law . we must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the ' polluter pays ' principle of responsibility which is , of course , supposed to be a deterrent .    2.8698160557203147
i have almost finished and i would like to say that i have personally requested a public hearing of the committee on transport , which would enable us to provide an immediate follow - up to the erika case and to suggest possible future considerations .    2.8618238803964307
i hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing .    2.5275542558206117
mr president , the oil tanker erika , the ownership of which is UNK by UNK addresses on malta and probably in italy and greece and which was UNK by total - fina for the transport of oil , UNK off the breton coastline , with disastrous consequences .    2.4096059644271053
the implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the european maritime environment are enormous .    3.4747874257819067
the cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker .    2.944274105787714
so people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods .    2.285590210941373
the international maritime organisation has issued international rules in this connection .    2.4576108906048932
states can carry out port inspections .    2.6688029870653542
in europe , legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25 % of the incoming vessels according to the port - state control directive .    3.0696086995740446
however , it seems that none of the member states meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors .    3.061531654632273
it is clear that there is no lack of legislation .    3.0095884179986667
in my opinion , the commissioner is quite right .    3.1268114131192797
where the scheme UNK is in the enforcement of existing legislation .    2.8170879039764576
but how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors , esteemed european commission ?    2.6966237722720137
can the commission provide an assurance that directive 93 / 75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all member states ?    2.0393746287857253
should its implementation not be more strictly monitored ?    2.5806559793878923
would it not be beneficial , in the short term , following the rotterdam model , to inspect according to a points system in which , for example , account is taken of the ship ' s age , whether it is single or double - hulled or whether it UNK under a flag of convenience .    2.7696142066927623
in short , to give priority to older sub - standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements .    2.1738636586826585
the erika was built at a japanese UNK and is single - hulled .    2.420701065584211
there are four more UNK ships in service at present .    2.376166357283115
construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of UNK was especially high .    3.010674996643956
some of them also sail under the maltese flag .    2.6208371138379474
would sanctions not be appropriate , as the commissioner stated , for the classification society ?    3.4639548315174973
rina is currently the talk of the town .    2.9066631986482605
malta is entering the accession negotiations .    2.9383038253048612
in my opinion , the european union can only accept malta if it is guaranteed that the maltese flag will sail without an accident in future .    2.6233947476486374
i would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time , and this delay is going to limit the time available for questions to the commission .    2.9154992419329635
mr president , just before i went down into the chamber , i received an e - mail with a quite emotional description from a swedish woman who had chosen to spend new year ' s eve on the french coast in brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives .    1.9307308022803935
like many other hundreds of volunteers , she had seen the destruction , washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and UNK when they really should have been required to be there .    2.1866944134656285
like so many others , i too wonder where the people responsible are .    3.035306327836897
where are the shipowners and those who order the UNK when these disasters occur ?    2.5868948510836036
this is not the first time we have seen oil slicks , whether UNK or UNK .    2.6363347839441387
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.799445241956104
i would like to thank mrs grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before parliament .    2.131772217895097
the environmental disaster of the sinking of the erika off brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the british media .    2.3260508212724678
although britain and france have had their differences recently , i can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected .    2.8925580555444927
tv pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife , in particular birds and the already UNK fish stocks , have brought back UNK of similar british disasters , such as the torrey canyon in 1967 , and have prompted many british volunteers to help .    2.236401124104221
i salute these joint efforts to repair the damage .    2.380115441091052
this is clearly a problem for all eu coastlines which will require imaginative solutions .    2.5871140607736494
instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as UNK of london , we must develop new technologies to UNK from the sea much more than 10 % of the lost oil .    2.7924766038722013
there is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market UNK up the UNK .    2.268010159186535
ultimately , the polluter must pay .    2.9074915748527355
in addition we must build on the council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25 % of ships calling at eu ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered .    2.0614251359908433
moreover , although i am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice , i believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations .    2.8288149679605796
rather than banning flags of convenience , which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet , under the 1995 eu directive on port state control , national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations .    2.445556234545563
i sincerely hope that , particularly during the french presidency later this year , the commission and the council will look carefully at all these options , and i heartily commend this resolution to parliament .    3.243695785807911
mr president , it feels quite strange to be standing here again today , as i have been doing at regular UNK for almost ten years , and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence , and not by force UNK .    2.678486104285459
the victims are waiting outside .    2.6901511274403
they want answers .    2.8816637386362625
they do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep , or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through .    2.646223357886656
the citizens are right to ask : " do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever ? "    2.564560326585064
who will provide us with new jobs ?    2.8636994256519688
when will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun ; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group , rather it is a joint european challenge .    2.6699511213965184
that is why i welcome mrs palacio ' s action plan with open arms .    2.6508925300511943
it is equally important to note that " prevention is better than cure " .    2.377448084693946
but there is an art to that as well .    2.7842079656817935
UNK the german UNK ship " UNK " - it is right outside my front door in cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of european neighbourly help .    2.1592768031240595
we are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew .    2.635853715153656
we are therefore right to demand improved controls , sanctions and preventive measures .    2.2571720787971965
i have been fighting for a european environmental coastguard service for almost ten years , here in parliament .    2.6680560771048136
the issue is as topical as it was before .    2.83672383008033
furthermore , i will not withhold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow meps , to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of european and international cooperation .    2.613667701472289
mr president , firstly i would like to express my very sincere thanks , not only for the initiatives of the different groups , of mrs grossetête and the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and the european democrats , but also for the initiatives of mr wurtz and the confederal group of the united left / nordic green left , who proposed this debate , which has led to a positive and important discussion .    2.7562681362353874
i would like to tell you that , in fact , it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem .    3.7587399771870054
there are men and women who depend on fishing , gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas . they are environmentally sensitive areas , but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium .    2.381869308216149
and therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation .    2.9844689440202052
mrs roth - behrendt said that nothing had ever been done .    2.2309899776722815
in fact , i believe that things have been done by the commission , but there is still more to do .    4.042898059072257
this was demonstrated by the americans who , after the exxon valdez disaster , within one year , adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation , which threatens , as i said earlier , to divert ships unacceptable to american ports towards europe .    2.2143539471108906
in europe , after the amoco cadiz , or the urquiola on the spanish coast , in 1976 , or the torrey canyon , in the same year , or the many other cases there have been , we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995 , particularly in the last few years .    2.959402504717219
during these years , the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of UNK transport .    2.8653663006328314
that is the reality .    2.9464592507380676
in my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems , also deriving from american legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector .    2.3939141994560313
i have referred to a series of issues which i will lay out in more detail , if you wish , in an appearance before a special committee on this matter , or when i present the actual initiatives in the coming months .    2.813194385931186
flags of convenience are one problem , but are not the only one .    3.357979082125807
the romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but , nevertheless , that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections ; more than the countries with flags of convenience .    2.3862078416979022
malta and cyprus have asked to join the community .    3.0477847854787075
we must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end .    3.5510657772234344
this will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the european union , and to deal with the notorious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a community register .    3.6445276582001314
i believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the registers of the european union countries .    3.9594265368522032
as for the inspections , very much a key question , the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked , as mr hatzidakis has said .    2.878086761350405
we already have legislation .    2.7945214060857078
according to the information which the commission services have given me , this legislation is not adequately applied in many member states due to a lack of personnel , means and inspectors .    2.606866087034908
the problem is not that only 25 % are inspected , but rather how we select , how we find , the ships which constitute the highest risk , through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags .    2.2232977996389427
unfortunately , the 25 % often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements : in this way inspections are UNK and the work is carried out more easily .    2.9230633233247687
therefore , more than making amendments , we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done , apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to UNK , especially in relation to the age of the different vessels .    3.3630071659477836
with regard to the question of union inspectors , i believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the member states , which does not mean that the commission does not have to ensure that the states carry out their duty adequately .    3.7517097578938303
lastly , i would like to stress the issue of liability . not only in terms of maximum sums insured , which i believe should be similar to those in the united states .    3.1638565078857135
we have set a figure of usd UNK million ; in the united states they are talking about usd 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments .    2.4808072050369
i believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the united states , but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and , therefore , the liability of shipowners , and also to hold liable those who charter ships , which is to say the owners of the cargo .    3.257958207106711
unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable , we will never , in my opinion , resolve these problems .    2.6785013371814683
i will end now .    2.818902504863465
i will not expand further . we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions .    3.524764704669246
but , obviously , as some speakers have said - and i thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where , within one , two or three years , we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done .    3.713463211882839
as for me , i can say , after having debated it in the college of commissioners , that the commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures , amendments and directives to parliament and the council , in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety .    3.5201598911576952
the political will of this parliament is required - and i can see that i can count on this - as well as that of the council of ministers .    4.482974675558988
thank you very much , commissioner .    1.9725151098002782
we have taken good note of your intentions .    2.924001672433793
i have received 8 motions for resolution , in accordance with rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present commission statement .    2.496501850729278
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.716053081557172
storms in europe    3.8576529635993784
the next item is the commission statement on the storms in europe .    2.4685777519625165
mr barnier has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.7683328302067594
commissioner , i would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward , particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the european union , in terms of the help that we can offer them .    3.143929353027451
in the days immediately following this terrible storm i wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the french authorities to UNK the boundaries of objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in france and elsewhere could benefit from objective 2 .    2.410905317091841
i think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it .    2.9387382421863353
in fact , we all know that anyone who does not live within the UNK of an objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid .    2.727563296872266
we should therefore put this situation right immediately .    2.431140117259923
you also know that this will not only be a short - term problem , but also a medium and long - term one .    3.986811960730304
let me explain .    2.852441212369312
i was in the region of lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20 % of UNK forest .    2.562002009459076
indeed , for some ' forestry ' districts , which have lost 20 % of their trees , this represents a huge loss .    2.4507094966606378
we know , for example , that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity , so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one , two or five years , but over many more .    2.5733869511513507
the towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years .    2.7984911453232093
i think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial UNK .    2.194777789683987
i think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies .    3.2857070744120684
it is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one .    2.8871482694502286
indeed , you spoke of UNK funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not UNK .    2.383158413088314
on the other hand , districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer , as the national forestry office has decided to freeze cuts in UNK for four years .    2.5149844855399612
those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case .    2.387326739824988
i am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is , and i thank the commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could .    3.272602541218626
i would also like to draw your attention to the fact that , although there has indeed been an economic disaster , the real ecological catastrophes are still to come .    2.6425373625407382
as you yourself said , commissioner , these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes , and we think that these are the first signs of climate change .    3.1281474242902725
we should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact .    3.345747683601227
mr president , everyone who has travelled here by car , train or aeroplane , has been able to see the extent of the damage , particularly in france , caused by UNK of a completely unprecedented violence which struck europe at the end of last month .    2.7987090722579073
what can the members of the european parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster ?    3.0614544269074355
firstly , i would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who , on a daily basis , have had to reassure their constituents , organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services .    2.612379927114523
they have earned the confidence of their fellow - citizens .    2.552264759643473
next , i would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the union ' s member states who , in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation , came to support the efforts of their french colleagues .    3.1793183083786936
i would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid .    2.7764482388806497
if this disaster had taken place in UNK or turkey , we could have immediately used the community budget to help the victims , but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so .    2.909575060725602
we must also ask the commission not to prevent local authorities and individual states from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying community competition rules too strictly .    2.563515539893181
i am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies , which have been particularly badly hit .    2.422745347919704
as you said , commissioner , we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced UNK in activity and that appeals can be made to UNK for investments that have been totally wiped out .    3.146546523805834
beyond this , i think that implementing magps in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected .    3.1139102518058057
i therefore ask the commission to stop doing so and , on the contrary , to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments , which they urgently need .    2.796095384578475
mr president , the storms which devastated france during the night between 26 and 27 december have caused , as has been said , 90 deaths and damage to a value of ff 75 billion , i . e . eur 11 billion .    2.1104344099477674
almost three weeks after the disaster , several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones , 500 000 UNK of forestry land , or 100 million cubic metres of forest , have been ruined , and our historical heritage has also been affected , as the sad example of the park at the UNK of UNK demonstrates .    2.423198613539825
it seems quite natural that given such a disaster , national and european solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected .    2.4987218909863507
as the previous speakers have said , and as you said , commissioner , in response to my fellow member , mr martinez , with regard to another tragedy , the floods in november in the UNK of france , you have certainly noted these disasters with concern , but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued , which has resulted in this shocking paradox . this paradox , pointed out by the previous speaker , is that it is easier , a great deal easier , to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the union than within it .    2.978230783888298
we know full well that what you are doing , commissioner , and that is , limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the structural funds of the new objective 2 or from the provisional objectives 2 or 5b .    2.8809586557176536
these are the terms of the written answer you gave mr martinez on 11 january 2000 .    2.437199185563777
i can show you a copy if you wish .    2.608240945914362
we would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the commission , but also of this parliament , and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so .    3.182264592919475
but for pity ' s sake , and i am not saying this to you in an aggressive way , please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms .    2.3022718544317815
as a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters .    3.2146793564609295
we must use the berlin summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the union . that , however , is another problem altogether .    2.890173392415557
mr president , commissioner , europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium .    2.280197240818619
i would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in UNK as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated europe in december .    2.4326379012202772
these storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests .    2.2767099462844556
i hope you do not mind if i make particular mention of the forests in my region , lorraine , which have suffered enormous destruction .    2.3738209141972924
i would like to congratulate the regional authorities , the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but , unfortunately , their UNK are not yet over .    2.8452061574489664
it is europe ' s duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of member states affected by the disaster .    3.158747089345664
i welcome mr barnier ' s statement and i also welcome the measures which the commission has announced .    3.441309523558138
i am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter , as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this .    2.5516007422128726
the community action programme for civil protection , established by a council decision on 9 december , was launched on 1 january 2000 .    2.6569843777524627
i ask member states to grasp this opportunity . this programme must work at full capacity .    2.494855393803803
although it may have been effective in certain areas - and i do not doubt the sincerity of commissioner barnier ' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry .    3.0455303639760203
our priority , as we wait for community - level funds to be freed up , is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between member states .    2.8376095873471034
it is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads , and to repair them as quickly as possible .    2.497785922049819
lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure .    2.0536857022280643
our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of UNK problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest , and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood .    2.2320296100299406
finally , it is essential that we slow down the UNK of standing wood , in order to give priority to the purchase of UNK .    3.2114495369131646
these timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in member states .    2.4165357072472293
i ask the commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over .    2.8273234438908132
it is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between member states in the face of an ecological and economic calamity .    2.712715893143281
if this solidarity is to have been worthwhile , it is up to europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry .    2.883942139055769
hurricane " lothar " should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking UNK once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here - , but to switch to the precautionary principle , under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too .    2.412890283344502
current programmes must be accelerated .    2.6617615334916866
for example , as they stand , the commission ' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under kyoto .    2.85213232332517
the trade in emissions rights is UNK to my mind and rather than solving the problem , it UNK it .    3.005714856502075
the entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term .    2.5870495218476908
we must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the white paper for renewable energy sources , as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases .    2.5527281507635706
the new commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate !    2.99730497314429
commissioner , mr president , lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto .    2.9729361244415
the hurricane of the same name swept across europe claiming numerous victims , mainly in france and germany , but also in switzerland , leaving a trail of destruction in its wake .    2.4895822733558153
the wind triumphed over electricity UNK , roofs , traffic signs and , ultimately over the forest .    2.0206688256950187
we have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber , and this is only an estimate .    2.455767136810466
i have listened to you very attentively commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in france and in germany .    2.458945484502974
if mrs schreyer is to visit the black forest UNK in the next few days , then any one farmer might ask her how the commission and europe would be able to help him as an individual .    2.916103500842412
what would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an objective 2 region , or in a 5b region ?    2.661305151512872
what answer will the commission give , when it is on the scene , when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam - building , and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc . ? all this is well - intentioned advice .    2.727112192966549
however , i come from an area in northern germany where the forestry industry UNK and i can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage .    3.171480118720558
mr president , commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two facts .    2.6739203431661847
firstly , at the beginning of 1999 , nato , with the participation of most member states of the european union , UNK kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom .    3.456659678388495
we are now endeavouring , at huge cost , to get the country back on its feet again and help its people , and rightly so .    2.385534611872889
secondly , at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast UNK of the eu .    2.782679316675132
the commission in brussels responded to the victims ' UNK for help with a UNK of shoulders .    2.9284498630220037
" we do not have the wherewithal for that , " they said .    3.0831339462815155
this is wrong !    2.90085477394766
and no one can comprehend this attitude .    2.8231290404787357
certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss .    2.3453640850406527
the citizens of the european union expect solidarity , also from within this community .    2.995495618100604
i say they have a right to solidarity .    2.9799622843839173
indeed the european parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need .    2.7981388241500027
i urge the commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms .    2.863393389768261
it knows the UNK and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .    2.3125398235522754
i call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to support me in bringing home to the commission the fact that what most brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will .    2.62140827866735
permit me one further comment . although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm , the tanker disaster off the french coast has made it very clear that we need to give the commission a helping hand on another matter .    2.699055290814853
the european union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .    2.4782042814655436
we can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal UNK .    2.290007639078456
we must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment .    2.251077976176308
then , for example , people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart .    2.526527349962763
when , in 1994 , over five years ago that is , i joined the legal affairs committee in this parliament , i became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier .    2.9643257844382074
to this day i am still awaiting an initiative from the commission , which will actually enable me to start work .    3.0834234473586495
it is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste , and i hope that february does not see this dossier being postponed yet again !    2.524644157326763
mr president , commissioner , the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should UNK us into thinking about certain problems .    1.95815800688736
of course , there is a need for solidarity here .    3.167689130410212
there is certainly a need for european civil protection , and the eu budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters .    3.4362100804661573
but , most importantly , it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature - mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature , for nature cannot make mistakes .    2.475856652065024
the extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many monocultures , if we are talking forests .    3.108775649412922
of course , i am in favour of providing assistance where we can .    3.1387968569103273
but when it comes to aid , we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone UNK underground .    2.5574955688699466
we must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation , rather than monocultures .    2.2643344684104454
the most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate .    2.9427763496935895
to this day , we in europe remain in the UNK position of having the gulf stream , and the gulf stream still does its stuff .    3.02965174137319
america and south - east asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go .    2.6423315457995757
we are fortunate in having the gulf stream .    2.5016981577170423
but in common with others , we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect .    2.724314048363413
this is partly the work of human hand , as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations .    2.9072285240363605
we must take more account of the guidelines produced at the kyoto environmental conference .    2.869437681193184
we must reduce co2 emissions , employ renewable energies , and generally make enquiries , in this connection , as to how the forests of europe are UNK .    2.531249900113473
mr president , i think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims .    2.503414916066258
this is an irreparable loss .    2.58858439547778
secondly , we welcome the solidarity between the french departments and citizens , and the solidarity of other countries with france , which is the country worst affected .    3.1982588479546603
as i have little time , mr president , i would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution .    2.9063762504630084
i believe that the first one was UNK recognised by the commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not .    2.407912570823859
that is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities , in general terms , are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years .    2.413983649579864
in fact , over the last decade , the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century .    2.918014878659226
therefore europe must be clearly committed to the kyoto protocol and make specific proposals .    2.7638282778622756
secondly , i was rapporteur for civil protection in europe and i completely agree with the commissioner ' s proposal to create a european civil protection body .    3.4923101531586425
first of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy .    2.848624169922886
it is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by european standards .    2.1816643113339067
it is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this .    2.747152228071624
i want to thank the commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at european level to give assistance to member states and regions that have tragedies like this .    2.7678004150807407
that is important .    2.6615164517051824
the other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past .    3.119294075219908
it was very small .    2.8029860815795535
it was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by members of this house proposing action when the disasters were not even major .    2.7452971909264763
officials and ministers from member states were coming to brussels , UNK with the commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies .    2.5884957031520064
so there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished .    2.546000973997256
i think we should reinstate this budget line .    2.679486517292797
when we had the earthquake in greece , which was a big disaster , the community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the greeks .    2.6452629276568125
the same when the floods came in france and the same again now .    2.704001597015281
these are major disasters , we should have an instrument , we do not have it .    3.5634839899632134
we should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument .    2.2209577437776358
we can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it .    2.614812357704627
we did not have it so bad in ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the atlantic .    2.5956314640477416
we had floods in ireland also and i want to express my sympathy with the people in ireland who suffered from these .    2.8941555112848723
ladies and gentlemen , none of us must forget what has taken place .    2.724773783268654
it is true that there was a joint decision by the council and parliament seeking to UNK emergency lines .    3.0304591811089763
it is also true that there is a lot of european money around . commissioner barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development , forestry would be eligible under article 33 , companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in article 87 ( 2 ) of the treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the structural funds .    2.3811547286811234
it is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .    2.151770881077506
it is nothing more than the states playing at taking from peter in order to give to paul .    2.780147075777108
this is inadequate , and i am personally delighted that mr barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which , moreover , i expressed when i told the press in bordeaux what i am hoping for , and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of european civil security .    2.8075698031563836
if the european citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being , if the mandate that our president , mrs fontaine has UNK on a closer relationship between the union and europe ' s citizens is to be effective , our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency .    3.515296107893568
i therefore believe that a european civil protection force , real civil relief blue UNK , who would go to areas in difficulty within the union , as we currently have no emergency procedure , but also outside the union if needs be , in UNK or anywhere else , is something that we should hope to see . i would like to tell commissioner barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly european in spirit .    2.7359931906676525
mr president , commissioner , when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation , we see that europe gets off relatively lightly .    2.524125109327021
nevertheless , the storms that took place in the last week of december showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us .    2.6435137640428055
anyone travelling to strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in alsace as well .    2.2722527712633083
each and every one of us knows that any other region of europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow .    2.4414763732352096
what we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible .    2.842739392503296
for it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long .    2.706421709342821
for instance , it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the UNK UNK ' s UNK , and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have .    3.888335851114815
that is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the UNK weather arrives .    2.7165645453080827
decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry .    2.7149041826690388
for we all know how long it takes a tree to grow .    2.6209478695176736
the calculations are in decades rather than years .    2.3094350232840655
in addition , i would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production , for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a UNK against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions .    2.400077016162379
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.799445241956104
mr president , i extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms .    2.6070853103807536
sometimes within the community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries .    3.369160373446772
we had very little coverage in ireland of the tanker that sank .    2.2765386812984216
i was asked to highlight the result of the storms in ireland .    3.4470192580280585
we had high winds and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of UNK being UNK , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water .    1.9005757551814095
we experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of e . UNK - infected water .    2.0622736122337924
i talked with farmers whose UNK were UNK their UNK due to drinking the infected water .    2.0840537158156756
natural habitats were destroyed .    2.7819708377989687
so i ask that ireland be remembered in this particular case .    2.5632654897516027
i thank the commissioner and support him very much in his european protection force .    2.572153208941812
mr president , commissioner , i second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims .    2.4223062590002566
i would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout europe .    2.8718449731895155
for the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of europe , and i believe we need , in the long - term , to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future .    3.8641009581385175
we certainly do not want market organisation for forests , but maybe we should set up a system , perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector , which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way .    2.9404896794118915
unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future .    3.1474643020820934
as has already been mentioned here , there are indications - no proof , but clear indications - that the increase in storms world - wide has to do with the climate catastrophe .    2.6512280522386713
of course , the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet , but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to UNK greenhouse gases as we are doing , these storms will , of course , hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century .    2.7421387494422937
i believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this chamber by a former fellow mep of ours , UNK UNK . he suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women , we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time .    2.5154054219858253
however , an exception should certainly be made in the case of shell and UNK , for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate , rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability .    2.427586372115956
we must be aware of this connection ; i do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm , but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course !    2.7341697565845657
i have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .    2.084251150967008
that concludes the debate .    2.231945172538318
the vote will be taken at noon on thursday .    2.6361211915423883
food safety    3.932517569061678
the next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the commission .    2.805908865794699
mr president , i am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to parliament the main lines of the commission ' s white paper on food safety , adopted on wednesday last , 12 january , in association with my colleague , mr liikanen .    2.4813335345830763
at my hearing last september , i promised speedy delivery of this white paper .    2.297584715959161
i am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly .    3.1632275578246585
the white paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new commission was appointed last september .    2.3186363785639768
it takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the commission ' s green paper on food law was published .    2.9151213177898008
equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge , as well as the bse crisis .    2.181430522890564
the white paper also reflects the concerns of this parliament which you have outlined to both president prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this house since the commission was appointed .    2.8995986181528446
i do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in europe ' s food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months .    2.639514570035261
the commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up - to - date and effective food safety regime in the world .    2.293010357804875
when i launched the white paper last week i said that the shopping UNK is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth .    2.808853736095378
the most UNK decisions are made by the consumers of europe .    3.1217706889206314
if their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions . this in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers , producers and industry generally .    2.017494758937767
in an industry worth some eur 600 billion annually , even a slight UNK in confidence levels can have significant effects .    2.067294039586745
between the UNK - food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees .    2.630280312583491
high levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness .    2.5417307657835084
this crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and european level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety .    2.2081915230837357
in saying all of this , i would like to make it clear that europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems .    3.5188087940352237
the challenge is to make the system the very best .    3.199782969153528
the overall objective therefore of the white paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food .    2.614342123384454
the commission will need the full support of parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule .    2.980526018406522
we will also need the fullest support from the council and other key stakeholders .    3.1935207021719325
the white paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing eu food legislation .    2.068835846183779
all of these measures are designed to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .    2.92170633296138
we want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers .    2.4370546868937453
the detailed action plan on food safety in the white paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years .    2.718685542752086
over 80 measures are envisaged .    2.677413684335894
our objective is to put in place a coherent and up - to - date body of food law by the end of 2002 .    2.7577067722205304
we are also envisaging the establishment of a european food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime .    2.629537669242248
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .    2.821070658268087
it has already attracted much comment , including reactions from members of parliament .    2.2765964033249184
the chapter of the white paper devoted to the establishment of a european food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments .    2.573133883236961
we are seeking views by the end of april on what we envisage .    2.7887766718090483
i will return to this process of consultation in a few moments .    3.1447282379793293
the commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of UNK the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence .    2.6939748316430245
why should a european food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ?    2.7198350628170975
the first key concern is independence .    2.4508414025956182
key stakeholders , including consumers , are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests .    2.147818017106274
we must also ensure excellence and transparency .    2.493782128629638
we have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the bse crisis .    2.64513746634714
however , the commission believes that we must go further .    3.8011440037014093
we must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .    2.1051342396442734
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .    3.0969569992417756
we envisage that the work of the existing five scientific committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority .    2.749539380460741
they may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority ' s establishment .    2.579095248737198
however , if we were merely to propose a simple moving of UNK , this would clearly not be enough .    3.1114697471681207
as the white paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value - added structure .    3.148556559352423
i am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened .    3.0063129826944563
within the authority i envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists .    2.5003992243049455
i am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react , identify issues before they become crises .    2.0653546437449175
this proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority .    2.4271934781456066
to be proactive the white paper identifies a number of new areas that would be UNK by the authority .    3.8832808940231005
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the eu , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in member states .    2.275195665789147
as part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns .    2.089632935076074
the commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority .    2.534932994305163
we believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the commission , parliament and council .    2.621050241066964
i make no apology for this approach ; i firmly believe that it is the correct one .    2.992315822207403
certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law - making powers to such an authority .    2.664993393138016
it was only last year that the treaty was amended to give parliament a much greater role in the legislative process .    2.899287521581779
to give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability .    2.564375606364328
i will be very interested to hear the views of parliament itself in relation to this matter .    3.2510305511882756
there are also those who argue that the commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .    3.21472648519103
i also reject this line of argument .    2.4907337661497895
how could a commissioner for health and consumer protection reject or ignore well - founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?    2.4320020987095154
would this be in the interests of europe ' s citizens ?    3.7951018273599866
in my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based , rationally argued and fully justified .    2.1372832859633575
it seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving .    2.2672036555789723
i can assure you here today that the commission , in exercising its risk management functions , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .    2.9970543185490373
i have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the member states .    2.4686611002617247
this is a major task .    2.9261159934464
we must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the european union .    2.47505655706755
the authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues .    2.6357185967679846
i do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science .    2.6421752978797755
however , with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies , the authority will become pre - UNK on the european stage .    2.88366048193285
i am also anxious to hear the views of parliament in this regard .    2.9488394931943365
as an integral part of a value - added structure , the white paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication : to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer - friendly way ; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up - to - the - minute data on risk ; to be highly visible ; to tell the good news story about food ; to be proactive .    2.4258747604519915
the white paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls .    2.6678889875303318
this is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that member states and operators are complying with community legislation .    2.8807249032938724
i want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .    2.64847303470902
in this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in dublin .    2.3928231413038716
this revised community framework would have three core elements : operational criteria set up at community level , community control guidelines , and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control .    2.280872976436361
as part of our proposals in this area - which i expect to bring forward at the end of this year - i will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the commission .    3.362942875033626
these could include UNK community financial support or UNK funding already committed to a member state .    2.299840676041394
these proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world , boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the union .    2.7714302436660407
in addition to the proposals for a new european food authority and an enhanced control system at community - level , the white paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the community ' s legislation , covering all aspects of food products from farm to table .    2.8866014691827764
it sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation .    2.0903816188367856
the new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , UNK and residues , novel food , additives , UNK , packaging and UNK .    2.29843346170735
it will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers , farmers and food operators , traceability of feed , food and ingredients , proper risk analysis through , for instance , risk assessment - that is , scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is , regulation and control - risk communication , and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate .    2.342132837342647
as regards the precautionary principle , i might add that the commission is currently UNK a communication which i expect to be adopted very soon .    3.5250809368056597
i look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the members of parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available .    2.371108072140306
however , having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees , i recognise that this was not feasible .    2.6698637062698594
but i know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the white paper ' s proposals on the authority .    3.30651624306767
we now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the commission ' s ideas on the white paper on the establishment of a european food authority .    3.602582265466092
parliament will have a key part to play in this debate .    3.380637157364783
parliament played a crucial role in europe ' s response to the bse crisis .    3.103239490792347
it has especially active since then in bringing citizens ' concerns about food safety issues to the fore .    2.2051198094786635
while we have a number of months to the end of april to debate the issue and UNK our views , i recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe .    3.5108138574561014
i would therefore ask parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible .    2.4953045399324307
it is essential that the commission should have the benefit of parliament ' s contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the european union ' s food safety regime .    3.175102783681074
the european food authority will be a key ingredient in the eu ' s food safety regime in the years ahead .    3.0949776485744334
it is essential that we get the mix right .    2.6688477098316183
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his statement .    2.5759298426567114
i would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the european institutions , including the commission and parliament .    3.402382475635977
that is very much the right approach .    3.107994489693536
but there is one word that i have not heard you mention here tonight .    3.19878169494226
i hope that we can UNK this out .    3.0079492129252503
we need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .    3.7095020072831617
it is very important that we include liability in that process .    2.5209551394156087
that is the one word i am talking about .    2.8877724087138366
the problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong .    2.1909487948014523
that cannot continue .    2.9908499562420046
when we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable .    3.247479319596455
mr president , it is a very worthwhile white paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority .    2.6351540223455667
my questions relate to the positive list for animal feed .    2.7578071208091353
you are unclear about this in your white paper .    2.5127323598411353
what is your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?    2.545671002785562
when will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ?    2.4814674202109064
the final part of my question is as follows : when will bse testing be binding in all member states ?    2.659800815884549
that is another point , i . e . the question of obligation , which you were somewhat unclear on in your white paper .    2.756686894018893
thank you , commissioner , for your statement .    2.9043891307217793
the member states would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .    2.813284287413206
some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs .    2.86933676234381
however , as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years , i have to ask : if europe has the safest food control system , as you have said , why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives ?    2.610861442947242
secondly , will this not compound the problem of over - regulation from brussels and under - implementation in the member states ?    2.759315332902253
we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .    2.4810223694843376
regarding enlargement : what plans does the commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws , given that the commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the white paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003 ?    2.7100091613908397
president , first of all i would like to thank mrs ahern , mrs roth - behrendt and mrs jackson for their words of support in relation to the white paper .    2.808411141930728
i find that encouraging and i look forward to further discussions with them and other members of parliament in relation to the issues that they raised .    3.2114434526180284
mrs ahern raised the issue of liability .    3.1504115475615673
that of course is not specifically addressed in the white paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability .    3.596436012140996
once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed .    2.392373771385552
i have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background , but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved .    2.494232643150179
but i have taken on board your suggestion and i will give it further consideration .    3.123643663856616
mrs roth - behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list .    2.5841240428786523
that is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .    3.3981071262935796
at the moment the list is , as i say , a negative list and it is added to as required .    3.118613904826081
the establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it , 2002 in fact .    2.985205392195532
this is unfortunate and it is wrong , and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done .    3.3864010620375433
the work in relation to bse in member states and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of UNK in member states is ongoing , i know that mrs roth - behrendt has asked me this question before and i said i thought it was coming along quickly but i understand it is in inter - service consultation in the commission and work is currently under way .    2.9735937196302276
i hope that the next time you ask me the question , i will be in a position to give you more detailed information .    3.2187422296629387
mrs jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over - regulation .    2.5366366763219963
i should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation .    2.9679434381195096
it is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation , although that is part of it , but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them .    2.6784121980190183
there is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind .    4.183449530463975
standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that i have drawn to the attention of mr verheugen .    3.230173877888687
commissioner , the ignorance of certain member states has landed us in a major food crisis here in europe , and i am afraid that once more i have cause to be UNK at the fact that again no members of the council are in UNK , and that on the day that you present your interesting report .    3.4866088205222945
what i would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind , whatever name it goes by , will be given influence over the council , who in this authority will have the say in matters , and who will issue orders .    3.066785787726635
of course , we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content , but i would insist on parliament retaining the rights accorded it under maastricht and amsterdam , and even extending them .    2.708226737668807
i very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through europe anonymously like a satellite ; an authority of this kind would be UNK to me and i hope it does not come to that .    3.1271704444224255
i also welcome the white paper .    2.8629379193321816
but do you envisage that the food safety agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and france ' s refusal to lift the ban ?    2.5360254771324424
you mentioned the commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that france is acting .    2.7309145461251565
would you also propose that the commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the british farmers are asking for at the moment ?    3.218019612255059
mr president , you said during last week ' s information session that it was your view that any future eu food agency should not be located on the periphery , but you did not mention what that periphery was .    2.3777614424208497
for example , the work of the eu unit located in dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters .    2.521880758600777
it has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather , publish and coordinate data , make recommendations for improved food safety , and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers .    2.458791264852321
all this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the european union .    2.7620301119092536
i would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location ?    2.235399181529183
in relation to the makeup of the authority : first of all it will employ in - house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time .    2.3782414902365328
in addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .    3.06807205071015
you will notice in the white paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board .    3.1810050310784455
this is an issue which i expect will be discussed between parliament and the commission over the next few weeks and months .    2.6864069139647064
i envisage that the board ' s membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders .    2.4662113583136698
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal i will bring to the commission in september .    3.6614387494969614
we have not done that yet but it will be done in september .    3.2512960740789976
i do not expect that the board will have any function in UNK the scientists how to do their work .    2.3248488814704924
that would UNK the independence of the scientific advice .    2.9658646416277223
mr florenz asks whether parliament will have a say in that .    2.766667041393052
that is an issue for consideration and discussion .    2.8704255355860706
there may be a number of views on that .    3.65224600165747
some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for parliament or members of parliament - or indeed parliament nominees - to be members of the board .    2.8652429544940246
others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if parliament , through nominees or even meps themselves , were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated .    2.6511771159610378
it is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out .    3.213695352129955
mr florenz also raised the question of UNK .    3.14533328053199
i am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .    3.2105965023773164
it must be visible .    2.7079092998861305
it must be known .    2.976891768818404
consumers in the european union must know of the existence of the food authority .    3.6213472559383875
the UNK of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known , who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food , particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to UNK , UNK and such issues , so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority .    2.935534050661278
they will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some UNK of confidence already built up in the UNK from the authority .    3.039774202305737
it is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not UNK .    2.6745856921116786
it must be visible .    2.7079092998861305
i will do everything i can to promote that high profile role for the authority .    2.5609629061977204
mrs lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth .    2.633861259736467
i suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in member states begin and end .    2.8677222124766715
there would have to be an interaction at scientific level .    3.4269296574997474
quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for , or advising , the food safety authority at community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at member state level .    2.0078316145674386
that is an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .    3.24044109204276
there are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one .    2.3411260961868043
we must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists , that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at community level has the opportunity and is UNK to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all member states and indeed maybe even beyond , where experts are to be found elsewhere .    2.838760490597352
over time , as i said a moment ago , not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise , its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged .    2.5949372273902624
this situation can be achieved over a period of time .    2.875499399377047
you cannot legislate for consumer confidence . it is something that is earned over a period of time .    2.8622171165070953
however , the commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the commission , parliament and council .    3.19223272064294
i realise that this is a somewhat time - consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the authority is - i believe - the way forward .    3.1944370672772737
any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way .    3.041131933941076
one of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance .    2.9255284801902564
i hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process .    2.6196034763013922
in relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue .    2.519012186716317
it will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with community law pending a court ruling .    2.4503438609336268
in relation to mrs lynne ' s question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by parliament as it relates to budget issues .    2.718795494656411
mrs UNK then asked me about the location of the authority .    2.5092344070921584
no decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery .    3.156670937974416
i recognise that the UNK is located in dublin and , although i come from that part of the world myself , i have to accept that it is not the centre of europe !    4.5060093885307
but the fvo is in quite a different situation from the food safety authority .    2.2346708545089973
the fvo is made up of independent scientists and UNK and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in dublin .    2.7467642728209087
the food safety authority ' s situation is quite different .    2.7984274523308934
it has to be close to the commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the food safety authority and those of us who are involved in the UNK of legislation .    4.031302263452736
an important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean , what problems they have identified , what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise .    3.1305706898346064
equally , the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy - making process or the law - drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meets the UNK that they have identified .    2.863337923117961
it seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located .    2.5200108342361607
scientists will be employed in - house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and , in those circumstances , as scientists will have to travel , it is probably better that they move to a central location , once again where the parliamentary structures and the commission and council are based .    3.0498547150126627
that is my judgement at the moment .    2.6272977379889455
it may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and i will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery .    2.4746364457384553
colleagues , i am in a very difficult position because i cannot change the agenda .    3.2978099564364483
i would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the conference of presidents .    2.8615082803576515
if you feel that these sessions after a commission statement are important , i would suggest that we require more time than the half - hour that is allocated to them .    2.5003342856254234
on this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the house and we have had 29 minutes of response by the commissioner , and his statement .    3.286741068596532
as you can see , half - an - hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .    2.2867331154096067
i hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the commission on such future occasions .    2.826718403916415
that concludes the debate .    2.231945172538318
question time ( commission )    2.52203753673809
the next item is question time ( b5 - 0003 / 2000 ) . we will examine questions to the commission .    2.1572426572630325
we will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to question time .    2.0349172741734614
we will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session .    2.019740260636046
mr purvis has the floor for a procedural motion .    2.361381056147596
i object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for question time ; it is one of the few occasions when UNK have a chance to get their time on the floor and i do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda .    2.9216979850275
that is the agenda and i think that we should stick to the agenda .    3.7581666766541444
the fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5 . 30 p . m . , and you can see the clock .    3.040126178709315
i hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .    3.079044990235896
first part    3.3318143916855933
question no 28 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.0541973318407756
subject : construction of nuclear plant in earthquake - prone turkey the two recent earthquakes in turkey registering more than 7 on the richter scale raise tremendous doubts about turkey ' s persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at akkuyu , while energy reserves produced by the atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the eu spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes .    1.5068607702803773
turkey ' s nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by turkey ' s political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of canadian origin of the type acquired by india and pakistan .    1.684001166422321
what steps will the commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the eu but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the eu budget ?    1.9262875260026566
mr verheugen has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.6326580522232303
the commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in akkuyu , turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards .    2.5294868789794984
according to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet .    3.055767465550397
the commission acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the UNK , construction , UNK , operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in turkey rests entirely with the turkish atomic energy authority .    2.38900931338455
the commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production , including the nuclear option .    2.8216243539030454
as commissioner wallström indicated during the hearings in the european parliament in september 1999 , the commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the turkish government in the future and i am happy to inform you that i will have a meeting with the turkish foreign minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue .    3.473181425909432
in particular , the commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the UNK fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site .    3.2307333572843033
large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site .    3.0415014243669365
the commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons - grade material .    2.3405083354891563
it acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency .    2.538159603549854
this plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2 % .    2.406392816789542
at the same time , it also wishes to acquire UNK type reactors from canada , which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in pakistan and india .    2.466195867766715
in this sense , there is therefore a serious risk that some UNK will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the caucasus calls for a UNK country with weapons grade nuclear technology .    2.7562088905036335
so much for the political aspect .    2.8551793651689588
now to the technical aspect . the safety factor in this type of project , and i am speaking as an engineer , has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .    2.853890622703615
in cases such as this , where there is uncertainty , simulators are used .    2.7937101637005863
however , we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy .    2.2585586316784654
in this sense , all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this .    2.1097497555003635
a couple of weeks ago we had a debate in parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries .    3.037769567871985
i have explained the position of the commission .    3.059364394388594
you have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety .    3.442707934584458
so what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be UNK .    2.416146705831119
in the case of turkey it is different .    2.666761353760051
the plant is not yet there .    3.010227037494657
i have already said that turkey is part of the UNK and of the convention on nuclear safety .    4.091549008205078
if we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with turkey .    2.874687251316275
mr president , the commissioner said that turkey has signed the non - proliferation treaty , it has signed the nuclear safety treaties : why should there be any doubt at all but that turkey ' s nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the community , and would the commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with mr souladakis on this matter ?    2.8244980341570254
i think it is the right of a member of parliament to raise his own concerns and fears .    3.495293875149564
i believe that turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non - proliferation treaty , but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in europe and i think it is quite right to discuss them here in parliament .    3.251495992540575
question no 29 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.034099541994226
subject : depleted uranium weapons has the commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon eu states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the kosovan conflict ?    2.2040105213409835
if not , why not ?    2.5979525955836666
mrs wallström has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.7485164166492613
thank you , mr bowe , for your question .    2.5177212049817874
the european commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the nato action .    2.9994946602121955
as early as last june the commission financed a first study . it was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern europe and concluded that there had been no large - scale ecological catastrophe .    2.337121346233627
none of the subsequent evidence or analysis has UNK that original assessment .    2.4763781632292647
the commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the united nations environment programme - balkan task force .    2.8560266629452373
this is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the kosovo conflict and i recommend it to those who have not yet studied it .    2.9031149200620736
the use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the net .    2.9065698326147182
the balkan task force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict .    2.5453819845619496
however , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium .    2.2565018027103703
from a desk assessment UNK with a fact - finding mission the report concludes that the risks , if any , are limited to an area around the target .    2.235404930579111
future actions will take place within the stability pact for south - eastern europe . a special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed .    2.5967855766136902
it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed .    2.1896530901224547
first of all , mr president , can i thank the commissioner for that very useful response .    3.5164251360146195
clearly the commission has given some consideration to this problem and i am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue .    3.28124381949413
but i would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used .    3.066819504058481
this uranium becomes air - borne , is UNK and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in kosovo with rather more long - term effects than it has been possible to establish so far .    2.700529271313425
this seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the gulf war .    2.7064142176441344
how long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ?    3.075507542393935
thank you , mr bowe , for that question .    2.4711781850278576
we have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean - up of kosovo .    2.453703507762093
but those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium .    2.7112551540572687
no transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the federal republic of yugoslavia .    2.518934643079571
the problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted .    3.136142825560177
a big responsibility rests with the united nations because they are addressed with this report , so they have to take responsibility .    3.411095729947417
but through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is , for the time being , the kind of frame we can use for the work of the european union .    3.0842555875907935
it is important to follow up and it gives the member states , as well as the united nations and the commission , something to think about when it is a matter concerning military UNK and their effects on the environment .    3.8567421932255246
it also has a long - term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons .    3.042213147537323
mr president , commissioner , in a few months ' time , hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the adriatic coast to spend their summer holiday .    2.191068747162656
we know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast .    2.0116129871053112
are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the adriatic this summer , and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect ?    2.643864213671627
i wish i could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately i am not able to .    2.6585491866851942
we make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this .    2.137004465029166
that is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .    2.2807119216928253
what we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous .    2.929470474035432
in the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution .    2.8772574409293346
unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean - up exercise .    3.1903301377742466
i wanted to ask the commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the nato armed forces now UNK in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area ?    2.9458984922896274
i cannot answer that question .    2.6587657185457156
when it comes to medical checks and so on , i do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer .    3.0496702749725637
what we know from the environmental side is what i have already mentioned , that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it comes to medical check - ups i do not have the information about that .    3.2023832481898653
of course i can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .    2.6943427548305303
question no 30 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.0352000634675065
subject : appointment of a european union envoy for tibet in 1998 the tibetan government in exile received over UNK tibetans who escaped over the UNK mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb .    2.143703778408029
many of the refugees had been severely frost - UNK and many had died along the way .    2.411127007971709
the tibet intergroup is very concerned about the UNK situation in tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the european union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by tibetans daily in tibet .    3.1428859559528575
the tibet intergroup , therefore , UNK concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in tibet and supporting the dalai lama ? s proposal for dialogue with the chinese government to resolve the situation in tibet , calls on the commission to appoint a special envoy for tibet to address the concerns of the european union and to help bring the tibetan and chinese authorities together for dialogue .    2.9137270045350685
when will the commission appoint a special envoy for tibet ?    2.63953959509713
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.3665848488860535
the concerns expressed by the european parliament about tibet are widely shared .    3.0813392695468904
i have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues , including tibet , firmly and UNK to the chinese authorities .    2.9768035266413877
the european union did that at the european UNK summit in peking last month where we pressed the chinese on a number of human rights issues , including tibet .    2.8812330876286882
we again urged the chinese to begin a dialogue with the dalai lama .    2.5193383458362324
i urge the chinese again to do so .    2.514070692082563
we will continue to raise tibet with the chinese authorities .    2.638733965184854
we are also doing a number of other things : in the european union - china human rights dialogue , we have focused on a number of practical steps , including sending experts on assignment to tibet , planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health , education and training for tibetans .    2.7270294721441277
the appointment of an eu special envoy for tibet would be primarily a matter for the council to decide and parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them .    2.5543731030481633
but for my part , i am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts .    3.0068781038266197
it would be unlikely to have much impact on the chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the tibetan community in exile .    2.5169639485681583
i am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys , however worthy the cause .    2.4080462530108155
mr president , mr patten , of course , you are very well - qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in china , and you are well aware of how hard the tibetans are trying to initiate a debate , something which has always been blocked hitherto .    3.102319667507461
however , if your response was to be that we should turn to " mr cfsp " , that is , to mr solana , then i fear that this would constitute a one - sided approach to an external policy matter .    2.9969521006017956
your approach , which i am very much in favour of , since it is a coherent one , takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights ; i wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights .    3.7773994477053354
imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth , are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum .    2.375913806243354
the possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation , would be a step we should take in tandem with the european commission , rather than saying that it is a matter for the council .    3.720878497102672
let me make clear to the honourable member what the position is .    2.7631067709562274
i stated nothing but the truth when i said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the council .    2.549874227847047
as it happens , we deal with the budgetary consequences , the council makes the appointment .    3.037413947347816
some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .    2.835636828190743
putting that on one side , because that is the situation , it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues .    3.5346907500977713
i am very much hoping in the next few months that the commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out , among other things , that there is no UNK whatsoever between a regard for human rights in china or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the european union .    3.0737355995288924
i have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most UNK - everywhere in the world .    2.3066382318676033
i repeat that we have made our position known to the chinese on tibet .    3.1246327225117883
if i can make a literary UNK to the honourable member , who i recognise is interested in these subjects , i recommend to him a book published just before christmas written by isabel UNK , the distinguished journalist , on the problems of tibet .    2.6987863357669295
mr president , i would like to start my additional question with the tibetan UNK , which UNK peace and UNK .    2.3699861365224084
we are not just talking about human rights and the environment where tibet is concerned , rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace , UNK , UNK - as the dalai lama would say - to us europeans .    2.9070658836455814
the question before us now is what can the commission do to provide more practical support for his UNK , the dalai lama ' s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the tibet affair ?    2.9096086068021356
i would point out that doing nothing will be the death of tibetan culture and will mean the end of the tibetan people .    2.7446579957932697
i have much sympathy with what the honourable member has said about cultural heritage and about the UNK tradition .    2.756432835533387
like the honourable member i have read the autobiography of the dalai lama .    2.5148220903794924
it is an extremely moving account , not just of his responsibilities in and towards tibet but also of his spiritual views as well .    2.5877084701526187
the commission , like others , has urged dialogue .    2.7892200895921406
the dalai lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes .    2.640444645679873
i wish that the chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the dalai lama .    2.296223560951681
at or around the time of president clinton ' s visit to china , the president of the people ' s republic of china gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda .    2.671957261076745
it would be very beneficial , not just for tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in asia , but it would also be greatly to the credit of the government of the people ' s republic of china if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue .    3.0748207284659377
question no 31 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.0647002569897737
subject : commission ' s rejection of legislation on proper administration in the eu according to newspaper reports , the commission has rejected the proposal by eu ombudsman jacob söderman for a citizens ? right to proper administration in the eu .    2.569641950808874
although the commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration , it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made , but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service .    2.917919328921703
are these reports accurate ?    2.744556057824141
what is the reason for the commission ? s acting in this way , and how can it explain the UNK discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of eu administration ?    2.8785596957051593
does the commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five - point programme agreed between parliament and the commission in september , and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows parliament to express an opinion on it ?    2.572397870575949
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.3665848488860535
the newspaper reports that the honourable member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate .    2.5852135588135057
in november 1999 the commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its rules of procedure .    2.5928549705856248
at the moment the commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document , a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks .    3.030178106944635
the commission will then adopt the code at second reading .    2.6393231565485347
it should be noted that the new commission gave an immediate follow - up to the european ombudsman decision of 28 july 1999 in his own - initiative inquiry related to the code .    2.847120515233868
the commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the european ombudsman .    4.203934188340458
the code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the commission ' s administration with the public .    3.419044197287291
it will be adopted through a legally - binding commission decision to be published in the official journal of the european communities .    2.699747000730276
the document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the european ombudsman ' s office .    3.423081370052277
according to the related provisions in the treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its rules of procedure is the commission itself .    2.847055846888279
however , it goes without saying that the commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the european parliament on all aspects of administrative reform .    3.3659031854870656
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner .    2.4176289043529358
however , i would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997 .    3.393294593509468
the newspaper reports were misleading .    2.4902012667989086
i do not think there is any difference between us and the ombudsman .    2.7372601383490225
there is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and i think we are soundly placed on that .    3.1804806464000683
i want to repeat that honourable members , like the honourable member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it .    3.143258001251315
it is extremely important and i recognise the concern of the honourable member .    3.0576453708566187
i want to thank the commission for what i perceive as a very positive answer .    2.8776375694634946
for safety ' s sake , i should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that , where the commission and good administration are concerned , there is no part of jacob söderman ' s proposal which the commission thinks is unacceptable .    3.4877147440327887
is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved ?    3.2967485381893282
let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true ! " i would like to stress again that the commission has accepted all the ombudsman ' s recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of july 1999 " .    2.861212776464764
both documents , that is the commission ' s document and the ombudsman ' s draft , cover largely the same ground .    3.195165032176002
the only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis .    2.2642062667186655
i can go into that in detail if the honourable member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all UNK with the ombudsman on this important issue .    3.1398870074563483
we will be happy to incorporate mr patten ' s notes into the bibliography , as another UNK book for the members to bear in mind .    2.395019853488232
as the author is not present , question no 32 lapses .    2.2836703669427783
i apologise to mr vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy . i am sorry .    2.6443218893428537
according to the rules of procedure , you are not required to reply .    3.2616719700619647
i wish you a good evening .    2.6228064510532993
second part    3.3723082764243566
questions to mr nielson , who is replaced by mr patten    3.368020441494328
can i first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague , mr nielson , was that he could not be here but the honourable members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is , trying to ensure that our agreement with south africa UNK .    2.641437702693632
the commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development , part of the so - called UNK courses for new staff , something that has been done already but not , i admit , on a regular basis .    2.9661617638164706
the training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory .    2.2591644494595435
we also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management .    2.2740263391204145
as far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset , instead of having to be tackled separately and later .    2.906286270428332
my own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add - on .    2.451210417636391
the quest for equality should permeate the work of the directorate - general for development at all levels .    2.695942813795831
it is not to be brought in as a " sort of optional add - on " .    2.583605154587462
this must naturally lead to a UNK of development goals and strategies , together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women ' s and men ' s priorities and needs are better reflected .    2.828298128652144
in addition , measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender .    2.7670265370511116
equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals , action plans and strategies .    2.158832143274765
it would appear that we are in agreement about this .    3.3196318045206628
however , responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with UNK and unit managers .    2.3155364866367525
if the latter do not have the required professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority .    2.5879808030427824
extremely few members of the directorate - general for development , that is to say unit managers and more senior managers , have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised .    2.8538627256081766
only one manager has participated in gender training , and for half a day .    2.58095461785192
that is naturally unacceptable .    2.6982068587758348
what is the commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training ?    2.6533594921742076
gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees , but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course .    2.460192859022323
this limited training element has , however , been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times .    2.5756646953831983
as i point out in my question , one to two days , and not one to two hours , need to be devoted to the subject .    3.088521240146874
my question is this : is the commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the directorate - general for development ?    2.576895706997046
well i certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague commissioner nielson .    2.1066038308789574
i must not go on about books , but i have just been reading the book by david UNK UNK on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues , in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies , going back UNK .    2.56509397979943
secondly , in my view , while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the commission - it should be essential . and , since it should be essential , i would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training .    3.5956453867995637
that goes for everybody at whatever level of UNK .    2.4343147441372515
it is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their UNK but think that they are too grown - up or too senior to receive themselves .    2.1915111148873816
thirdly , one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross - cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground .    2.4919092058506322
so i sympathise very much with what the honourable member has said .    2.502846513669702
i hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates UNK and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves .    2.688513103086331
since 1991 , the community has provided significant financial support to the new independent states including the countries of central asia .    3.0321485884065202
the major part of european union aid has been provided under the tacis programme .    2.836480718684432
security considerations have prevented tajikistan from benefiting fully from tacis but a rehabilitation programme of eur 7 . 2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999 .    2.291017487021117
in addition to national programmes , the european union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors .    3.1291083254200207
food security programmes in central asia began in 1996 , following two previous years when the european union provided food aid in kind .    2.501064728279394
these programmes have benefited kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent , tajikistan .    2.463360606771313
funding for ngo programmes in tajikistan amounted to eur 7 . 42 million in 1998 and 1999 .    2.1293204842289617
over the same period , kyrgyzstan received eur 17 million .    2.213914948034064
since 1993 the commission ' s european community humanitarian office , echo , has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan .    2.505583259421378
in 1998 and 1999 eur 3 . 8 million was granted to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan received over eur 35 million , mainly for food , medical supplies , water and sanitation .    2.077434923574892
frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that european union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process .    2.5803593315800475
mr president , commissioner , there is a risk of central asia and the UNK sea becoming the balkans of the 21st century .    2.7024303407206895
that is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of turkmenistan and uzbekistan in particular . that is why i would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence , how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going , that is , with regard to political relations that is .    2.964707239885591
of course , that falls within your remit ; my next question falls within mr nielson ' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation , in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the UNK monocultures , which are the cause of great UNK .    2.6357026234802796
we were able , at the UNK summit a couple of weeks ago , to meet and have discussions with some of the central asian republics .    3.0446223424084713
i am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them .    2.8781289530745418
i can send the honourable member , if he would like , a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the central asian republics .    2.527877139709728
obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the UNK side .    2.9473489526774115
but i have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of central asia .    2.9845416959799764
i have heard the honourable member talk in the past about the caucasus as well .    2.8527648268913497
he is absolutely right to say that a union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much UNK in the balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise , had we taken more pre - UNK measures if those had been possible .    2.9897112604758873
so the honourable member ' s remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made .    2.780303421079782
we are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact .    2.731985420775628
our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty UNK .    2.5650257973423294
those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of UNK the land .    2.5235222604808167
there is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to .    3.1868535404944813
we also take good note of the fact that the member who has asked the question has applauded the commissioner ' s answer .    3.061568520372168
this is not the usual state of affairs .    2.5892336890758743
and furthermore the commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time .    2.4359991917240382
thank you very much , mr patten , for your interventions today .    2.4630456220542385
question no 35 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.0543379099415553
subject : greek action plan for employment according to the findings of the evaluation of action plans for employment , greece and italy are the main targets for criticism from the commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies .    2.706940735739609
the report states that in greece and italy targets for improving ? employability ? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long - term unemployment to be complied with .    2.4900392420372253
the report also comments that in greece there are no plans for medium to long - term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges , or for the satisfactory use of european social fund resources to support employment policies , and , in addition , that there are no exact employment figures .    2.8242512315030024
could the commission say whether the greek government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long - term unemployment , and what these commitments are ? has the government UNK for and put into place a suitable system for UNK , recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment , or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work ?    2.5002787519584784
as far as mr papayannakis ' question is concerned , in the 1999 action plan for employment , the commission proposed certain recommendations for greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the action plan for employment .    3.2501032645622057
the most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services , where problems exist , improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the action plan for employment .    2.535722349857067
the greek government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy : " yes to work " and " back to work " .    2.443232724365629
we do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved .    2.356153564379238
the greek government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed , firstly , to restructuring public sector employment services in greece , secondly , to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and , thirdly , to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable it systems to monitor all these policies .    2.2605088022493867
in the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006 , which is being financed from the social fund , both the resources and the policies should be used , with the commission ' s support , to implement the objectives which i referred to earlier .    3.694540718885229
the commission will keep a close watch on the greek government in order to ensure that it UNK the commitments which it has made .    3.258001894519206
thank you , commissioner for your reply .    2.3612859068300085
however , our current situation is as follows : at 11 . 3 % , we have the second highest unemployment in europe , which was not previously the case , we have the biggest increase in unemployment , we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed , i . e . less than 1 % of gdp , while other countries , such as france , belgium and germany spend 3 - 4 % , and it is not clear how the money received from the social fund has been used , inter alia , to combat unemployment .    2.9799641105345365
you tell me that you , as the commission , have made recommendations .    4.288543421737076
i understand and welcome that and i hope that the recommendations will be adhered to .    2.7737679003586666
however , my question for a very long time has been this : what happened with previous policies ?    2.533904946356933
did anyone find work ?    2.7226778862015864
how many people found work ?    2.8004466275726156
if you cannot tell us for this year , then last year and the year before .    2.953320498654376
what has been done about training ?    3.41553564821598
is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for UNK or trainees ?    2.425923515399289
do we have any figures ?    2.916172475833633
in other words , do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in greece ?    2.5479340393841188
mr papayannakis , the only answer i can give you is that the greek government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned , and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies .    2.730680163820863
greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and , as far as i can see , an increase in productivity .    3.1793799222534
as you know , there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated .    2.6982061981738017
they concern access to training , the ratio of men to women with access to training , and special action for the long - term unemployed .    2.3820454605531
the commission will endeavour , for all these specific guidelines , to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new community framework for 2000 to 2006 .    2.92482361912703
question no 36 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.9300878928765006
subject : danish early retirement pension scheme will the commission state whether the danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are UNK between denmark and the commission in other areas of social policy ?    2.6303168642672885
the danish pension scheme , the efterløn , only allows people resident in denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in denmark to retire .    2.2262939814821943
some workers have complained to the european commission because they do not have the right to retire .    3.775554431942482
the danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under danish law .    2.3599630540289627
it should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are , however , still pending before the council .    3.7446517015831944
there is , as yet , no european court case law on efterløn , but it could UNK be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality .    2.229232034975652
the commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the danish government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach .    2.814410846384389
the last meeting on the subject was held in november 1999 and we are waiting for the commission services ' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against denmark .    3.0824765413542505
i noticed that the commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the commission , but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been .    3.1979073625716796
i should like to ask the commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the commission .    2.9167659245088084
the commissioner also more than hinted , of course , that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the danish early retirement pension scheme before the court of justice in luxembourg , specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually UNK against non - danish wage UNK who are unable to fulfil the conditions , due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the danish system .    2.793206535179411
so i should be grateful if the commissioner could enlarge upon this question .    2.4033577433444835
honourable member , i should just like to stress that both denmark and numerous other member states are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law .    2.980093864511656
this is one such case and discussions are under way between the danish government and the commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter , to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who , as things stand , have a right to this pension .    3.3659379971779027
briefly , just to follow on from that last point , i invite the commission to make it absolutely clear that the commission ' s objections , such as they are , would not in any way infringe the rights of danish nationals to benefit from this scheme , but simply that the commission has a concern , which it has the right to have under community law , to ensure that the scheme applies to all eu citizens who qualify .    3.4875386756506255
i think that the answer is brief and clear .    2.673205775239128
of course it is as you say .    2.976504151781973
there will be no problem with danish nationals within denmark , that is not where the problem lies .    2.968942294550799
the problem is with danish nationals or other nationals residing outside denmark .    2.2487182088217996
question no 37 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.9403872615151374
subject : working time directive can the commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection , equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive , for non - consultant hospital doctors , who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a council amending directive ( com ( 98 ) UNK - c4 - UNK / 98 - 98 / UNK ( UNK ) ?    2.355285642342023
a proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non - consultant hospital doctors .    2.891370374960459
the content of the proposal concerns the average 48 - hour working week of doctors , with the possibility , following negotiation , of increasing it to 54 hours .    2.393888148589047
the council , commission and parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive .    2.9785727927363532
parliament has proposed 4 years , the commission 7 and the council 13 .    3.6639775284668397
this proposal is still being discussed by the council and parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure .    3.557927860923154
although there is this disagreement , i should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout europe .    2.6122203424295094
question no 38 by ( h - 0805 / 99 ) :    2.2166926233275133
subject : measures to advance gender equality one of the working groups of commissioners announced by president prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality ( gender mainstreaming ) .    2.502681463384428
which commissioners are members of this group ?    3.2859072092821067
how many meetings of the group have been held to date ?    2.9841522533231024
what concrete measures have been discussed ?    2.9693126996152377
this question covers several individual matters .    2.427793322471442
it refers to the special commission working group dealing with questions of equality .    2.5373203564469713
the commissioners taking part are president prodi , vice - president kinnock , mr reding and myself .    2.4333105904225167
the meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 january 2000 .    2.604063468791846
three serious issues were discussed : the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women , of which i gave an initial evaluation , the second issue was the report by mr busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science , and the third involved mr kinnock , who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the community .    2.775845294001849
we trusted this commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women .    2.5087422777277655
i hope that , in the future , things will change and meetings will become frequent , because there are many issues which require the attention of the commission in order to speed up and conclude , as quickly as possible , those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women .    3.012865116144725
mrs avilés - perea , that was an UNK rather than a question .    2.75947626801925
but if the commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions .    2.466877975523376
allow me to say just one word . i agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least , once it did , important decisions were taken straight away .    2.5665185011237797
question no 39 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.9306738785662745
subject : community equal initiative on 13 october 1999 , the commission adopted the community ' s equal initiative , the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum - seekers .    2.8313064789507725
under this UNK , each member state is to submit proposals in the form of a community initiative programme for that particular country .    3.1274952506897518
what criteria will the commission use to approve or reject the member states ' programmes ?    2.9611002455237534
which community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly ?    2.469957520247679
the european social fund contribution for the period 2000 - 2006 will total 2 UNK billion euro . as the equal initiative is a joint funding venture with the member states , what will greece ' s contribution amount to ?    2.6578986735603776
the equal initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people .    2.482568571743375
its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace .    2.8296756343342557
the decision on this initiative was taken in berlin , where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action .    2.8072471577579234
this is an important aspect of this initiative .    3.114887543634787
the community initiative programme in each member state must comply with the regulation . this is the same as the social fund regulation , i . e . equal comes under the social fund regulation .    3.596739672878296
it has been submitted to parliament and we expect parliament ' s opinion next month .    3.2112728436995472
i should like to stress that the equal initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed european strategy .    2.543031711036451
the member states , i . e . the national governments , have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies , submitting proposals , selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control .    2.254902536276913
within the european commission , the directorate - general for employment is responsible for implementation , while financial control is the responsibility of the directorate - general for financial control , the anti - fraud office and the european court of auditors .    3.3458399712531617
the last question concerns the amount granted .    2.905181087438321
greece has been granted UNK 98 million . the contribution commitment is 80 % , rising to an 85 % contribution from the initiative for the island regions , especially the remote greek islands , and a contribution by greece of 15 % .    2.3419028377018996
mr president , i feel that the guidelines for the community equal initiative , especially the four actions described in it , will result both in complicated bureaucracy and , paradoxically , a non - transparent structure .    2.680324755995185
for example , one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity , as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines .    2.014368256238326
at the same time , the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation , the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures , as these are the only structures which can meet such demands .    2.5975532104696777
however , this UNK the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas . however , at the same time , participation by those actually discriminated against , such as asylum seekers , immigrants and so on , is UNK impossible or merely symbolic .    2.8235738213722046
finally , if you consider the overall amount , which is on the small side , - eur 2 . 8 billion for 15 member states - and how ambitious the objectives are , i am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing .    2.6186944156263325
first let me say that it would be a great help to us , now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by parliament , if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account .    3.3753518134693317
secondly , i have to say that the aim of the equal initiative is not to reduce unemployment , it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment , or to support an increase in employment .    3.719685246050279
that is the job of the european strategy for employment and the social fund , which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal , especially for countries like greece .    3.0410493344561553
the equal initiative has a specific mission . to encourage , to assist promotion , to create statistics , to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination .    2.3019123320015606
this is the philosophy behind the initiative ; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies , non - governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible , so that it can get as close to the people as possible .    2.792750598390012
subject : article 13 teu and employment the draft commission directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations ( art . 4 . 2 ) .    1.8890169115847397
could the commission please tell parliament the circumstances and the groups within article 13 ( teu ) likely to be effected by such an exemption ?    2.0509268463481707
a month ago , the commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment , as prescribed in the treaty , in order to implement article 13 .    3.741293168846567
the ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted .    2.437119953354026
at the commission ' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies , member states and the european parliament , a number of exceptions have been made .    3.3128329835857455
these exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification .    2.436630806757983
allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this .    2.6698562635450003
in a religious school , it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs .    2.851521049762905
that is the sort of exemption we are talking about .    2.6910956667199413
clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow member states to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification .    2.714084905959882
this is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination .    2.363955322379214
for instance , religious schools could quite properly say to a roman catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you are a UNK man or because you are a UNK .    2.25094237829611
here we have from the commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression .    2.8604542636786823
surely what we should be doing , and i hope you will agree , commissioner , is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability , and we should not enshrine such UNK and prejudice , no matter how sincerely held .    3.246068377875829
i must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason , be it the reason which you mentioned , sexual orientation , ethnic discrimination or any other reason .    2.4349810433246954
it allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question .    2.2770869906905213
in other words , it is positive discrimination .    3.4785005692148725
in the example which you mentioned , it is only logical that the teacher in a catholic school should be catholic .    2.7255255741684623
that is the only form of exemption which is acceptable .    2.5373733236769342
question no 41 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.9352374006606068
subject : promoting jobs for women in severely less - favoured regions given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less - favoured regions , and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on , in terms of either finance , entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities , living as they do in rural districts where 80 % of the population is on the poverty line , what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment ?    2.1285266642137803
does the commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real - life situation of these women , or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies ?    2.158275413690856
obviously , the cohesion policy exists for less - favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the structural funds , the social fund and the agricultural fund exist for the cohesion policy .    2.8063763783872666
i should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget .    2.627095984613868
the aim of these regional policies , which , of course , are implemented under the jointly agreed european guidelines in each member state , i . e . each member state is responsible for implementing this programme , is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women .    2.9705984934443634
i should point out that 70 % of funding for the period 2000 - 2006 , i . e . eur UNK billion , will go to the less - favoured regions of europe .    2.5833799642310336
with particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created , i would like to say , first , that there is , via the social fund , an entire equal opportunities pillar which the member states must implement , i . e . special policies for women which must use social fund resources .    2.9046829033651327
secondly , the leader initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism , with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions .    2.4982661405725706
commissioner , thank you for giving me a well - intentioned answer , which has been rigorous and well - argued .    2.80569334812841
however , i can assure you that we do not , with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less - favoured regions .    3.0671731672555427
they are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation , where almost none exists .    2.921624841047342
therefore , my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on UNK , which have brought results in cooperation , could be applied to those women in severely less - favoured regions , who have the odds UNK against them .    3.0520329196682856
i am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to .    2.982408694941022
i can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need .    3.3542595665761494
with these forecasts of the structural policy - which i know very well - and the forecasts of leader and rural development , we will not promote , as we should , employment amongst women in the severely less - favoured regions .    3.1585653720914766
i would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying UNK policies .    2.728773472280626
question no 42 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.0526538498672586
subject : commission ' s plans for presentation of a new social action programme it is important that the commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme , setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the ' social dialogue ' .    2.889957163509183
can the commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme ?    2.5774307942749655
we estimate that the commission ' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer .    3.4110173689670233
in order to complete the programme and be able to present it , we first need to complete our consultations with parliament , the social partners and non - governmental organisations .    3.1683799874393586
the lisbon european council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society , economic policy and reforms .    3.0884211141083444
these results will be most important in shaping the commission ' s social programme .    2.9538712067733277
clearly , any future social action programme should take account of developments , for example within information technology , and , in time , become a modern social action programme .    3.137766492180514
but can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter i raise in my question , namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the commission is planning , as well as for those initiatives which the commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry ?    3.181186197318073
we need to see which concrete alternatives the commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements .    2.5732998168029066
firstly , i agree with you entirely . account will be taken of the information society ; that was something which i too mentioned .    2.7358681439788226
social exclusion , the programme for women , the efforts we are making in the social protection area , everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society .    3.5437463934993416
secondly , there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented .    2.9058013692797027
where i cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which , as you know , is not included in the articles of the treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the treaty .    3.16623796059416
question no 44 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.9306631820718585
subject : opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the eu under article 13 of the amsterdam treaty , it should be possible for all eu citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the union .    2.6369827565818778
however , for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance , freedom of movement is still highly restricted .    2.3015586448985554
what measures is the commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area ?    3.0823267509512333
on 26 november 1999 , the european commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination .    3.6972912559638647
as far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned , there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination , especially in the workplace .    3.0691072272829607
the european commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and , in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these persons .    3.8015754844079117
the european commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses , coaches and other vehicles , so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them .    2.2543227261671355
in addition , you should know that , on 4 june 1998 , the council approved the recommendation for a UNK - european type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs , the aim of which is to help them travel in all member states with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout europe .    2.930672867467803
i would thank the commissioner for her answer .    2.9640639954617116
my question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in europe .    2.6910104423063257
it is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from UNK to somewhere else in europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a UNK and also need to have a personal assistant or UNK with you in order to manage .    2.9718662493765606
i am grateful for the fact that the commission has adopted an action plan .    3.413639494578908
it is of course a prerequisite , however , that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability .    2.630765911667493
it would be interesting to hear whether the commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have UNK , so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them .    2.810846798695279
i referred to the directive which the commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport , so that people with special needs can use them .    2.9972583114130593
it has not yet been passed by the council ; it is at the consultation stage .    3.6932843618985074
i think it is exceptionally difficult for us to UNK in aid programmes for personal transport .    2.6861267728746503
that is dealt with either under special programmes in education , for young people , for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy .    2.613704971803744
question no 45 by ( h - 0006 / 00 ) :    2.381760308478643
subject : compliance with directive 96 / 71 / ec concerning the posting of workers the posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in denmark , even though the deadline has passed .    2.275235549043841
the draft legislation before the folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements .    2.0706413283301623
pursuant to article 3 ( 8 ) of the directive , terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the ' collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers ' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory ' .    2.5753100257085926
however , such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis .    2.3620518326383753
there are therefore two possible solutions : either the directive is inapplicable in denmark , or denmark is required by the directive to introduce universally applicable agreements .    2.3275645163313228
can the commission confirm that the directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in denmark as far as ' collective agreements . declared universally applicable ' ( UNK . article 3 ( 1 ) are concerned , given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under danish law ?    2.6509984843581327
if not , will it explain how the directive is to be complied with in this area ?    3.5822820105439255
the european union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country .    2.2594210716937626
what it says it that one of two things may apply , i . e . either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector .    2.62931478759647
in other words , to put it simply , denmark has a choice : it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally UNK it .    2.1544351308756315
discussions are being held between the european commission and denmark , and denmark is expected to notify the commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation .    2.739463717414161
the deadline by which it had to answer the commission ' s questions expired on 6 december 1999 and we have not received a reply .    3.29457178682022
we are waiting to see what the next move will be .    2.652056902715176
thank you for a very clear answer , the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements .    2.7583233055402627
it is a very clear answer , but it is also an answer , may i point out , which puts danish organisations , the danish government and the danish parliament in a very , very difficult situation politically , for it is a well - known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the danish model , which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements , and the continental model , which presupposes legislation .    3.386359602808747
the disagreement and the UNK to which you refer , commissioner , concern , first and foremost , another directive , namely the working time directive , but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further treaty infringement proceedings UNK because the danish government does not intend , or has expressly stated that it does not wish , to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements .    2.5412362624132236
firstly , no attempt is being made to change the system in denmark or in any other country .    2.704342694880386
as i said earlier , there are always problems interpreting the directives of the european commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another .    2.901713258777562
as far as your question is concerned , this problem does not only apply to denmark . it is not only denmark which has matters pending .    2.949605688554117
five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage .    2.525969090799437
and this is the direction in which we expect the danish and the other nine governments to move .    3.3261985335023425
thank you very much , commissioner , for your dedication .    2.6523909542375947
you have fulfilled your objective for today , which is to answer all the questions .    2.9286262160062706
we congratulate you .    3.0115137710443305
since the time allocated to questions to the commission has elapsed , questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing .    2.325324593966592
that concludes question time .    2.3954164037117547
( the sitting was suspended at 7 . 50 p . m . and resumed at 9 . 00 p . m . )    1.7625042261068973
1997 discharge    3.98680838311418
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0004 / 2000 ) by mrs van der laan , on behalf of the committee on budgetary control , on giving discharge to the commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the european communities for the 1997 financial year ( section i - parliament , ii - council , iii - commission , iv - court of justice and v - court of auditors ) [ sec ( 1998 ) 520 - c4 - UNK / 1998 , sec ( 1998 ) UNK - c4 - UNK / 1998 , sec ( 1998 ) UNK - c4 - UNK / 1999 ]    2.325028991809161
the commissioner , mrs schreyer , is not here yet , but i hope , and expect , that she will arrive in the next few minutes .    3.2076276930929803
nevertheless , i recommend that we start , in the hope that the commissioner will be able to follow the debate , and particularly the rapporteur ' s speech , from her office , if that is where she still is .    3.5202852904305626
mr president , i am sure that mrs schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be UNK otherwise .    2.726752864529642
i would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report , it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation .    2.7866792967048624
mr president , early last year , the 1997 discharge was postponed because this parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a UNK commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future .    2.38497193552029
in its resolution , this parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious , far - reaching proposals for reform from the new european commission .    2.6416467421870578
this report , therefore , appears at a crucial time , on the eve of mr kinnock ' s reforms .    3.142106714110087
it is an excellent opportunity for this parliament to introduce far - reaching reforms to these plans .    2.848402470734832
in the period leading up to this , it already appeared , on the basis of the initial drafts , that the commission had made very important pledges .    3.3233760152881477
we asked for a whistle - UNK ' s regulation , and this is now in place .    3.3989888902437237
this has now been done .    2.961561559439122
parliament requires a code of conduct for commissioners and cabinets .    2.4439440189402366
this is in place too .    3.0770151358259
parliament asked the commission to waive its excessive UNK .    2.9796614680108595
it did this as well .    2.889243992160438
the commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with parliament in terms of UNK 2000 .    2.8381362394160603
these are sound , first steps which illustrate that , if this parliament so wishes , changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly .    2.537960002218203
the commission should now produce an ambitious and far - reaching reform programme .    2.658115711036509
this is not only necessary for proper public administration , it is a UNK sine qua non of regaining the trust of the european citizen .    3.4133861806929064
we now demand from the european commission clear pledges concerning the following points .    2.926102511754649
firstly , parliament must have complete access to all commission documents .    2.6210055632497093
this , however , presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents .    3.0348925824786286
in the context of providing information , i would like to draw the commission ' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents .    3.4337942876988348
if the current draft is correct , then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today .    3.023230201962287
we must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not .    2.471493502616128
neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents .    2.3893320918890346
we would also like a clear job description for each european official so that an official with UNK objections can more easily object to tasks which are UNK or unlawful .    2.1545898692332695
furthermore , it should be the case that , if the court of auditors UNK a mistake not just one year but two years running , the management should be held responsible for it , and this will have an effect on chances of promotion .    3.091570464094598
this parliament has also asked the commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 march of this year .    2.60623518547203
it should no longer be the case that , although europe is an economic power , we have no political influence because , when the chips are down , we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it .    3.0378784663682223
i would quote gaza as an example .    2.578077116065836
it is unacceptable that the commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that , as yet , it has been left UNK .    3.622679369819224
mr president , since 1996 , the discharge has acquired a heavy , political significance .    2.2479879591894734
it is one of the most powerful weapons parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care .    2.7089239345403877
this is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow .    2.2367034470378546
however , we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place .    2.321948868301761
indeed , the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the court of auditors have been cleared up .    2.6344878985714297
finally , this discharge report is naturally addressed to the commission . but this does not detract from the fact that the european parliament should also put its own house in order .    2.9112594857780665
as long as we have no status , we are not credible as a force for reforming the union . the reforms of the european institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue europe ' s development process .    3.9619065952383035
we cannot have a decisive and fair europe unless it is also open and democratic .    2.7975373050987997
all institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of europe .    3.205791962987461
mr president , the committee on industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so .    2.724168273154895
we went ahead because we felt we should start this parliament in the way in which we mean to go on , that is , by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers ' money in europe .    3.0563412477712943
during the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget .    3.213240034704349
they were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them .    2.190663687532165
the first is a tendency for the commission to embark on very ambitious programmes , particularly in third countries , without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper UNK .    2.7191392138614976
the second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the commission , in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts .    3.2912555133522052
i know that all the institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the commission and for some of the lack of resources .    3.8144925000064935
that cannot excuse everything that we came across .    2.456607581988556
citizens of europe expect the european institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so .    3.712076477412081
that is why i want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of europe by mr prodi and mr kinnock .    3.1133947658064733
from what i have seen of the reform process , it looks good .    3.433029824599719
i saw some of mr kinnock ' s papers today , i heard some of what he had to say .    2.5828712760933654
i have every confidence that if we and the politicians of europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need .    2.6958909197839342
but we need that reform process .    2.9342599590905105
many of the general points raised in our committee ' s report have been covered in mrs van der laan ' s report .    2.959583924115376
it seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports , a series of details .    2.6771732003864943
it groups them together and that is very important .    3.575858865244195
there are two issues i would like to draw your attention to .    2.8217075617059106
one is nuclear safety in eastern europe .    2.595460730756542
we have to get this right .    2.7434193066257246
the committee of independent experts said the commission was not managing this properly .    2.5373954955616007
we have to remedy that .    2.7947115442017525
the second point is about scrutiny mechanisms .    2.437707198082908
we need from the commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending .    2.8811903401255967
we need proper information , given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past .    2.7149384870411186
it has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible .    2.8341955619873125
i hope colleagues in this house will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and , at the same time , that the commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue .    3.2576895849058602
only in this way can we create a new culture in the commission and at the same time get public confidence restored .    3.623865116497779
mr president , i am sure the commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which , as you are all so very well aware , led to the forced resignation of the santer commission .    2.584787240180437
the socialist group will be voting to grant discharge .    2.902396921896139
it is clear that a radical overhaul of the commission is long overdue .    3.0861596889098117
it indicates , however , that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction .    3.310195693854954
i just want to outline some of the issues that we , as socialists , have put down as amendments .    2.9443785325902563
we hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform .    3.235084619876575
first of all , the immunity of officials : this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor .    2.5666296621892695
we need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption .    2.7104331832840756
it is critical to note that the commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the court of auditors .    3.0396952165853417
the court ' s report is there for a reason , our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through .    3.3290658012214625
i have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the commission .    3.141479532597728
even if we hear nothing else , we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see .    3.3129871385730305
too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them .    2.872671574985148
we want to see that follow - through to a much greater extent in future .    2.8644462946319766
we have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had .    3.666180593274038
we understand that we also have a responsibility here , that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential .    3.0398181788673084
we have put down an amendment to that effect .    2.790658449077794
one issue which is referred to in the van der laan report is the whole question of the gaza hospital .    2.9959343339161792
the situation there is totally unacceptable .    2.7280448361049445
we will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue .    2.7441942742487644
i would like to congratulate UNK van der laan .    2.463238682853041
i do not usually bother congratulating people but i think she has produced a very UNK report and deserves our thanks .    2.5020578096993593
mr president , commissioner , if we are honest , we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation .    2.587140880784823
we are discussing last year ' s discharge , but also the commission ' s responsibility .    3.87850595743456
i would like to raise the problems which are still UNK up high on our UNK .    2.924560173304843
the assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed .    2.579108884693602
it is about a commission which is no more .    3.16032484293417
there is now a new commission .    2.9898305447664226
then it is logical to grant discharge , because how can the current commissioner be UNK where 1997 is concerned ?    2.439185112828286
the problems remain and this gives rise to doubts .    2.458077873787112
we have to take a decision now regarding the commission ' s good intentions , but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions .    3.0664566825001005
mr kinnock will present his proposal next month .    2.4030058235970144
we are all very much anticipating this , but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge .    3.051602647009043
it is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also UNK .    3.1792195500275136
this dilemma UNK beyond the areas which i have already listed .    3.047019290697024
take , for example , the pledges made by the commission . they look good in themselves .    3.254338771259444
i have read a few documents written by mr kinnock and we have every confidence in them .    2.5785932495377173
but i will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome : the public nature and confidentiality of documents .    3.169659229337073
the previous speaker already said something about this .    2.7964299386446188
a document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level , but at a high level within the commission - which , instead of enhancing the public nature of documents , is having the opposite effect .    2.8028990813176535
this is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results .    2.103083635628187
this also applies to whistle - blowers .    2.582795528396755
mr kinnock has also devoted some fine - sounding phrases to this subject but , at the same time , it is entirely unclear , at this moment when we have to make a decision , what , for example , happens with whistle - blowers who want to get something off their UNK and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or parliament .    2.783604167739585
we have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type .    2.6277391380550688
so there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made .    2.8081759152440875
this also applies , for example , to the very real projects which the committee on industry has introduced .    3.6551674850084934
in my opinion , the commission and mr kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management , but each commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general , empty proposals .    2.6323859846139896
at the moment , our group still feels sympathy for , and patience with , the commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past , but this patience has a limit .    3.1059030777574868
clear progress must be visible .    2.5852197353111634
at present , we trust that the commission will produce these sound proposals , but it is not a UNK conclusion that it will do so .    3.57625404145583
finally , mr president , the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last commission .    3.511728533014081
i express the hope that - in fact , i urge the present commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the commission . otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value .    3.21359180136302
in assessing the question of whether or not to grant the commission discharge , the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned , in this case in the course of 1997 .    2.9911782891646874
in our group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996 .    2.5582512936478143
in that year , we voted against granting discharge .    2.774062249776361
as a result , we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997 , too .    2.883447445535449
we think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the court of auditors .    2.806006305189032
it is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised .    2.1933196325352298
so far , the promises which have been made are still , however , to be fulfilled , especially where transparency is concerned .    3.195191909329287
we are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution , but against the granting of discharge .    2.7397749436554792
mr president , first of all , i have only positive comments to make on mrs van der laan ' s very expert work on this report .    2.480002019746777
the union for a europe of nations group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997 .    2.326445088499423
the report on so - called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts .    2.6585289169106527
we support these critical remarks , and i must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of approving the accounts .    2.9330620321389094
it has not been possible for the court of auditors to issue an auditor ' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful , and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we , as members of this parliament , were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned .    2.7442997115093988
the majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new commission ' s implementing a series of reforms , so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous commission ' s period of office is not repeated .    3.3387415321900544
again , i must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old commission ' s accountability for 1997 and the new commission ' s accountability for the future .    3.6757450011259545
we do not think that the new commission , under any circumstances , could incur liability for the past .    3.2079208452218535
we think it is wrong to talk about the commission ' s liability as an institution .    3.8018129714119713
the mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time , and we still have no way of knowing whether the new commission can do any better .    2.8539956874423584
by means of this extraordinary procedure , parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 UNK where it belongs , namely with the previous commission .    2.329836449246568
it was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous commission , and the 1997 accounts are just as UNK .    3.3607971521623683
there is no reason why , against this background , we should agree to grant discharge .    2.815979512847353
as far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned , we shall abstain from voting , and where , finally , the motion for a resolution is concerned , we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it .    3.044184019279097
mr president , the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile commission , to whom it was to be granted , had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a UNK capacity .    2.285804628508694
mrs van der laan ' s report - on which she has UNK a great deal of hard work , and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the commission for 1997 .    3.307087062916948
one might ask how it is that the current commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor ' s budgetary management - mr UNK just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year , 1996 , was denied .    2.6463241889145466
that is just the way things are , however .    2.6832326053898132
in taking over the mandate , the new commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made .    3.1658835632728795
since , on account of the college system , discharge can only be granted to the commission as a whole or , alternatively , denied or postponed , it is no longer of any consequence that four former commissioners who belonged to the previous commission that has yet to be discharged , crop up again as members of this body .    2.6776343658795225
this question ought to have been asked when the new commission was appointed .    3.3360513135712866
if parliament votes in favour of the committee on budgetary control ' s proposal this week and grants discharge , then the commission must not take this to be a blank cheque .    3.5757938896028474
for it is the third section of mrs van der laan ' s report that is the most important , to my mind , namely the motion for a resolution .    3.367530089843734
the comments contained within , under eight headings , are an integral part of the discharge , the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision .    2.7847080837246203
in the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - parliament will have to examine , as a matter of urgency , whether or not it was too quick to UNK premature praise on the commission for 1997 .    2.8135403717203604
we will be in a position to judge just as soon as the commission presents its reform programme .    2.9239806076395785
we will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , are being displayed vis - à - vis the discharge authority .    2.307013286114741
mr president , we all recall that parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new european commission regarding internal reform .    2.2512078477045323
in response to this the commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures .    2.7188013257972843
it is fair to say that the new president , mr prodi , and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this parliament .    2.8864807100507215
however , the reform of the european commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run - up to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference and the reform of various eu policies and initiatives .    3.8604263922857394
existing eu treaties will be amended so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed .    3.4972589546035633
i have no doubt further reform of eu institutions will be analysed in this debate .    2.3029909720459956
but from the perspective of small member states it is important that , as the european commission is reformed , it must be done in a way that ensures that small member states continue to have representation on the commission .    3.414932623982997
mr president , the commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997 , but in reality it does not deserve it .    2.860518214887264
1997 was a matter for the old commission and , therefore , the new commission does not think that it can accept liability .    4.315807073350219
it is true that implementation of the budget for 1997 fell within the old commission ' s remit . the new commission has , on the other hand , undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals , and i must admit that i am not impressed at all .    3.196312340237734
the old UNK which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one ' s friends unfortunately still exists .    2.2419612065887065
there are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start . i do not , however , think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly .    3.1178048385949713
i am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving echo .    2.261065123285551
i am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter .    2.8030788608515587
i am the rapporteur for echo on the committee on budgetary control , and i shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the commission will not give me the necessary information .    3.4281839501643483
from the outside , it looks as if the commission has something to hide .    3.376037790652029
my investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case .    2.751995640682252
the commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the commission .    2.4365546256108
it was this practice which led to the commission ' s downfall .    3.4990010962683704
i can therefore fully support the demand to give parliament UNK right of access to documents . otherwise , we cannot carry out our work .    2.765627515741238
thank you , commissioner schreyer .    2.2997364261725206
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.6677986406930794
response to second report of committee of independent experts    3.3204435243006336
the next item is the report ( a5 - UNK / 2000 ) by mr van hulten , on behalf of the committee on budgetary control , on action to be taken on the second report of the committee of independent experts on reform of the commission .    2.498174730521381
mr president , this time last year the european parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by mr UNK to investigate allegations of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the european commission .    2.9414422803504747
on 15 march the committee published its first report concluding that : " it is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility " .    2.208314035474122
within a few hours of the presentation of the report president santer announced the resignation of his entire team .    2.6765190900989095
the resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident parliament and a european commission UNK in allegations of scandal .    2.3413125343111325
since then the brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition ; a new , UNK parliament has been elected and a new commission confirmed in office .    2.3922443481419213
speaking in this house on 21 july president - designate prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the committee of independent experts on commission reform , which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today .    2.719411015232707
the new commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function .    2.8643528502268256
a code of conduct for commissioners and their private offices has been adopted .    2.438075201697797
in a symbolic but significant gesture commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax - free purchase of alcohol , tobacco , petrol and consumer goods .    1.8404216097607156
new rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials .    2.573671876673855
the number of departments has been reduced .    3.0650549758797845
the commission , in my opinion , has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated .    3.16461391790513
the overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong , honest european public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner ; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels ; an administration that recognises and UNK merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential .    2.432522663331357
in order to achieve this , action is required in four areas .    2.8302062436355198
first , financial management and control within the commission must be improved .    3.340178424424167
one of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control .    2.825052737825528
the commission ' s dgs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure , including financial control .    2.615055822605122
a new independent audit system service must be set up .    2.8018697492528046
in return for this greater degree of autonomy , managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions .    2.254036184922614
it is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time .    2.609671213190641
changes to the financial regulation will be required and parliament must have its say on those changes .    2.905422827468368
but while the commission must ensure that it respects the treaty and the financial regulation in the transitional phase , this must not be an excuse for inertia .    3.6700393445918134
urgent change is required today .    2.8344407746361817
second , the fight against fraud , mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened , firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive .    2.62180335556918
this requires a clear example to be set by commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly , by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud .    2.551629652873369
olaf , the commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent european public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts , criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the union by members and officials of the european institutions .    2.8404398143734095
a proposal can be made , a proposal should be made , on the basis of article 280 of the treaty , by the middle of this year .    3.716248511852864
third , standards in european public life must be upheld .    2.3599547118650066
the political crisis which led to the downfall of the commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct .    2.9086256117731897
a number of codes have since been introduced .    2.7003785032886416
they must be assessed by parliament and should be made legally binding .    3.101051280652666
the european institutions should follow the example of a number of countries , most notably the united kingdom , and institute a committee for standards in public life , with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the european institutions .    2.876761237783386
whistle - blowers who act in good faith must be protected .    2.4579848553567856
at the end of last year mr kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle - blowers .    2.5518374244805027
they must be implemented without delay .    2.8520016285791088
although such measures can never be an alternative for good management , they must be an escape UNK when something goes wrong .    2.5293945590016325
crucially , reforms must not be limited to the commission .    3.4406240807501884
finally , the commission ' s human resource policy must be modernised .    3.1821259492683587
it is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern , multinational organisation .    2.588978728165835
the social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue .    2.2366059677901027
a career with the european institutions must become more attractive .    3.6890631229735593
too many young , new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years .    2.3985533509474677
merit must be recognised and UNK , specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade .    2.6904288346017755
the UNK procedure must be made fairer and more transparent .    2.71051681092358
it must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions .    2.525395481458864
it must be rid of some of its more outdated elements ; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why european civil servants should be paid an UNK allowance indefinitely in a europe of open borders , or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of member states .    2.5697057084529606
commissioner kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform .    2.4091963475734923
this communication must contain a clear timetable .    2.4782765906682096
with a new commission and a new parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be .    2.1987706472312003
enlargement of the union is just a few years away .    4.167238972985535
now is the time for europe to put its own house in order ; to UNK in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility .    2.820228111775008
in june of last year europe ' s voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism .    2.5193711642789913
there is a very simple way to deal with those stories .    3.1341515151402644
let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism .    2.6677501738325606
mr president , i do not want to be UNK - i sincerely hope this does not happen - and i should therefore like to start by saying that i am , of course , in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate , necessary reforms .    3.3454609270454676
this is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide - ranging analysis , but i shall restrict myself to raising only a few points , in order to make people more aware , if possible , of what we are talking about .    2.920351794196768
all the experts can provide information and news , formulate opinions and give advice , but , they have no political or UNK responsibility , and rightly so .    2.3950621598380586
i nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be UNK from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which , on some occasions , i have felt in the past and still feel to be self - destructive .    2.6163154515077536
i believe - and i shall only pick up on a few ideas - that parliament alone , and no one else , can exert an influence over its members . if this were not the case , the european parliament ' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years , and this institution would not move forward , as it should .    2.983290524733421
it is just as important for no - one to be able to or have to refuse the european parliament or its committees any documentation .    2.9972185533837568
members of parliament must UNK the qualities of morality , discipline and discretion over delegated issues UNK , and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else .    2.462138504979574
i would point out that there is no european legal system , but that a different legal system exists in each member state .    3.0751807089086736
we run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways .    2.970423109895377
i agree that an investigation system should be introduced , but i am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and , in any case , the equal need for the right to a defence .    3.5423350555085418
i am opposed to european community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat : whistle - blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium .    2.015623816263878
in conclusion , mr president , parliament must introduce a principle of democracy : we must implement reforms which allow parliament to grow and expand its powers , not go into reverse .    2.6971109522575527
this debate on the van hulten report brings to a close one of the most UNK periods for the european institutions since their creation in 1957 .    3.3179221094002895
the refusal of the european parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget ; the motion of UNK tabled in this house a year ago for differing reasons ; and the first report of the committee of independent experts on the reform of the commission which led to the mass resignation of the commission itself , are now part of european folklore .    2.9741204315993355
those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the commission operated .    2.721459977149666
remember that the council of ministers , absent again this evening from our debate , approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the commission itself UNK on 15 march .    2.650236766577176
now we come to the second report of the committee of independent experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last september .    2.79388828038447
our greatest concern in the epp is to ensure that public confidence in the european commission is restored .    3.6896328032920294
further steps to build a strong europe will be to no UNK if the european peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over - UNK officials .    2.95579593359347
under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months , which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency .    3.17072737232329
we are therefore concerned to see the UNK of commission announcements in recent weeks by commissioner kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a white paper shortly .    2.6975618090359026
while conveying a desire to proceed rapidly , it also gives the impression that the commission is in transmission rather than listening mode .    2.6988946393401796
this was , after all , one of the causes of the downfall of the last commission .    3.3985124553094144
have the lessons not been learnt ?    2.6104710538268865
the knowledge that the framework relations between the european parliament and the european commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee .    3.13320234855734
we could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be UNK for parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the commission to take up in its reform package .    3.2670237449403694
the less precise , mr van hulten , we are in our resolutions , the more room it gives the commission and your former colleagues in the council to do what they like .    3.421970326599994
we believe the vast number of recommendations of the wise men ' s report should be implemented .    2.882617549856737
we have , as the epp - UNK group , submitted all the recommendations of the wise men ' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report , entirely changing the nature of the van hulten report in committee .    3.139987029553939
we have UNK a few amendments which fell in committee , in particular , our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you , commissioner , accepted - when we had our hearings last september - should be included in these codes of conduct , particularly when considering appointments and promotion .    2.6862741985285092
looking to the future , we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the european commission .    4.4927760894448285
we want in particular to see the hard - working and highly competent norm for commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been UNK by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals .    2.662353138684119
commissioner , you will be aware from your presence in the last commission why the crisis occurred .    3.151403911796083
in a nutshell : there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available .    2.134827736072712
we urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible .    4.0174192142247405
our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget .    2.413996604549869
we will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions .    2.477546653403817
but , equally , we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by commission president romano prodi prior to his nomination .    2.2588911676482097
let us hope that we can avoid institutional UNK by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of commission reform .    2.629364091604746
mr president , i must start by UNK that i cannot be nearly as dramatic as mr elles in my presentation .    2.4076539687460277
can i first thank mr van hulten for this report .    2.678861068902065
it is an excellent report .    2.9327843643380516
it would have been wrong for parliament to have put in UNK UNK every single recommendation that came from an external body because parliament should have its own opinion on these issues .    2.4122605142053013
it is right for us to have a focused report which is what mr van hulten has produced .    3.4345146945175755
can i invite mr elles not to put the cart before the horse .    2.2674125790719493
yes , a lot of things were lost by the socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet , and may i warn him that may not be the case tomorrow .    2.6115578716565047
i should like to thank commissioner kinnock for all his efforts so far .    2.2932828423090212
he has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change .    2.9364059093503445
central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility .    3.3507703968421834
it is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the commission .    3.044489282102374
it is clear that we need to see a change in the financial regulation .    3.6591575507595593
that is important .    2.6615164517051824
we need to stop people passing the UNK from one to another .    2.4804229230832004
where failure is occurring within the commission we need to hold people responsible .    3.148339688969336
this is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the commission .    3.0992152417829213
we cannot continue with a situation where incompetence , mismanagement and fraud are costing the european taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service .    2.1819350442463907
i will give you one example of this .    2.5207664092835147
in the 1998 court of auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to italian wine cost the taxpayers of europe UNK 8 to 10 million .    2.262435154971052
it is clear that is not acceptable .    3.0438857134655355
what happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation ?    2.5981509364468307
we need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit .    2.8370393864793337
we recognise that most of the officials within the commission are extremely hard - working .    3.2253311247608636
but we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated .    3.107862244622056
we look forward to reading the full commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the commission because , unlike what mr elles has just said , the commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with parliament between now and 1 march .    2.46557953768299
we also need to recognise that people who live in UNK should not throw stones .    2.640346642928462
the european parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history .    2.3658359656673387
we have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves .    2.9664964227587483
our own staff policy is outdated .    2.470471205164906
some of our working practices need radical reform .    2.6341646949079305
we recognise the proposals on activity - based budgeting .    2.7435890184072234
we recognise that means discipline on the part of commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities .    2.7358525060627064
finally , can i say that the commission needs to work on its relationships with the public .    3.486294612899411
european taxpayers need to be re - assured .    3.388394877790189
the fate of the commission , of the whole european union , rests on delivery of this reform .    4.189068336212471
that is the key issue , delivery of these proposals .    2.9657545972251858
mr president , i would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur , mr van hulten , on his first report .    2.557351628755586
i very much admire him for keeping his UNK up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments .    2.2540955922812804
i think that the report drawn up by the wise men has been useful and i think that it is also useful for this parliament - as already stated by mrs morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run .    2.7495325754838955
we have submitted an amendment to this effect .    2.9054850112035586
from the many points made by mr van hulten in his report , i would like to highlight a few , not necessarily in order of importance but just UNK .    2.928706331979797
firstly , i think that the commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents .    3.4015351040088055
the commission ' s records leave a great deal to be desired .    2.784744073175203
we noticed this when we had to investigate the UNK affair , which , as it happens , has still not been UNK out .    3.1740409497324262
curiously , very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets , even from those of the president and of various directorates - general , and this is clearly something which should not happen .    2.9074738515364937
if parliament want to carry out proper inspections , these documents must be available , and i would like to know what the commission intends to do to improve this situation .    3.0953710184379446
i would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control .    2.148265007411993
this has also been partly dealt with in the van hulten report . i think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented .    2.726149776515177
is this possible ?    2.9780945464410866
if we admit new member states then we need to put our own house in order first .    2.7934645180276503
mr president , i would firstly like to thank mr van hulten .    2.5683503792962297
it is his first report here in plenary .    2.6161778474632498
this is worth a compliment although i regret , of course , that he did not expound it in his own mother UNK .    2.5379266397588345
it is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late .    2.510590785456094
in my opinion , this is mainly down to the UNK between the two major groups within our committee on budgetary control .    3.301666361766337
let us be honest .    2.8481682642718535
the second report of the wise men arrived in september .    2.4840737397609067
we are now four months down the line .    2.4669029235181896
meanwhile , mr van hulten has been inundated with amendments , more than 100 amendments in the first round .    3.0606387307557426
he went back to work , UNK his report and took into account the very many suggestions , but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round .    2.619753956713793
my fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed , too extensive and too late .    2.8073805947618773
moreover , i have been informed that the commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our parliament , i hope .    3.42424980764512
might mr kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening ?    3.099305803145039
mr van hulten , my group of the greens and UNK will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon ' s plenary meeting to UNK this report .    2.745766106346174
after all , it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the committee of wise men word for word in your report .    2.579592709461587
so tomorrow , if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs , this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more UNK .    3.018003405813439
in any case , it should be clear that my group , of course , fully backs the recommendations made by the committee of wise men .    3.3954612953018546
in any event , i look forward to the document which was approved by the commission today .    2.982339059007345
i also look forward to the white paper which will be available in february .    3.6885595102151987
i have to inform you , commissioner , that both the report of the wise men and that of mr van hulten will become gauges for our group , gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the prodi commission or not .    3.180550703269225
i would like to end on the following point . just as the white paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated , we would request the same in connection with the new white paper on the reform of the commission .    2.7450481033353564
i think that there is a need for this , as public opinion is looking for change and , in any event , my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002 .    3.559871894401896
mr president , this report is positive but , actually , we need more than this .    3.0603379984538184
fraud , mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere .    2.65118269463137
they are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow .    2.490977984498713
this is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich member states contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer member states .    2.871039546811054
but there is also funding which is being pumped via brussels back to the same rich member states .    2.9580584986881275
districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating .    2.18636104903983
after each incident of improper use of this money , and certainly after fraud , the call for stricter control is more pronounced .    2.365874479691387
even the strictest control cannot solve this problem .    2.3500644549399214
it will , at best , lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects .    2.430334259701133
it would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a european UNK .    2.132240462580875
in the next couple of years , we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for member states or their UNK regions with a low income per capita of the population .    2.8238471056107715
this is probably the only way to achieve less fraud , less UNK , more transparency and more democracy .    2.475171813614561
mr president , a year has not yet passed , but it is already clear that parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently .    3.013628459430922
the first report was widely publicised , formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make UNK , first of the president of the commission , and then of the majority of the european commissioners , even though they had no connection with fraud , mismanagement or nepotism .    2.659548059754883
reading now what happened then , not even a year ago , it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform , as is maintained today , so much so that this second report - which , on the other hand , could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases , since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report .    2.5045034678814106
it is of no concern to the major groups in parliament , nor to the majority of the trade unions , who are busy discussing the defence of european public administration , but , in practice , are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members , putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use .    2.716781200039293
trade union representatives sit on the disciplinary board and the staff regulations committee , thereby making it impossible to remove UNK officials and preserving the staff regulations in their UNK state .    2.227302146716509
i therefore understand why we are meeting at this time , which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates , discussions and the exchange of information .    2.812126675220963
mr president , when it comes to putting its own house in order , the european commission is in a catch - 22 situation .    3.0993952159866667
there is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous commission .    2.752945660866088
i sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this chamber sound , the more applause they receive .    2.721578639589308
there again , it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few UNK of the pen , and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to UNK UNK .    3.636964955330326
this may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the committee on budgetary control as regards this issue .    2.347959170267082
nevertheless , the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see , and i would expressly like to thank mr van hulten for the work he has done on this report .    2.9208702548425682
provided this report is not watered - down yet again by the adoption of amendments , it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the commission on a number of crucial points .    3.602882200014397
allow me to start with the most important demand .    3.3860420716154507
we do not want financial control to be abolished .    2.555671697043278
the financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made , not in every case , but wherever uncertainties or risks arise .    2.4949503030392277
the commission is sending out the wrong signals here , by UNK the directorate - general for financial control as the directorate - general for audits , for example .    2.529072925597997
it may well be easy enough to change the commission ' s organisation UNK but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts , particularly those relating to budgetary discipline .    3.2706843474516685
i do not have exact figures , but the community ' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller , to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office .    2.5825960105548478
this cannot be ignored or evaded , certainly not on account of soft law , as was once suggested at a meeting of our committee .    2.592041224223415
irrespective of such legal considerations , it would be an unforgivable mistake , under the circumstances , to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the commission are , at long last , no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and UNK mechanisms .    2.7021042722833166
as we see it , there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future : a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller , concomitant and follow - up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up , and finally , there will be the targeted UNK - down of irregularities by olaf , the new anti - fraud office .    2.9829440996986527
it is to be welcomed that mr van hulten ' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie , which must be tackled .    2.678600509383592
a few salient points : the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect , especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours , including those of a financial nature .    2.3806909824539346
there is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned , and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the commission are rather vague .    3.3529805727260693
i can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be UNK .    2.823124498580202
mr president , firstly i would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague , mr van hulten .    2.7065808985782716
it is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and i am , i think , entitled to feel a little proud of him .    3.290356991098906
i would in any case like to congratulate him on his report .    3.2105207473056914
mr president , the commission ' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy .    2.3065384600819057
the call to make a cultural u - turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one .    2.6796915116449767
i have witnessed from close up within the development committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80 % of the money is not spent . sometimes , an enormous reservoir of money is created , not because it is not desperately needed , not because there are no sound proposals , but because the whole system has UNK .    2.5512991094268114
a lack of responsibility , too much ex ante , not enough ex post and , as a result , far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending .    2.9088907030936246
it would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result - oriented spending of this kind , with all the work organised on that basis .    2.686981357431052
when the commission ' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 march , i very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change .    2.8222525422184126
without any doubt , this will then be a service , mr president , to the european public and , by means of the results we produce , we will also regain and re - acquire something which we have UNK lost over the past couple of years .    3.846636765368215
this is the best support we can give to european democracy .    2.6160978314646286
mr president , first of all , congratulations to UNK van hulten for his first report .    2.229233492415864
it was a UNK of fire but we have a saying in the netherlands appropriate for this occasion : in at the deep end and you will swim in no time .    2.6946575842564418
there are two points which , in my opinion , deserve special attention on the part of the eldr .    3.114242509272546
this must be regulated during the igc .    3.0615848744939314
however , we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the council and we have , therefore , submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the commission and parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall - back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the council .    3.415316783555006
secondly , as already mentioned by my colleague , mr mulder , the eldr is of the opinion that the european parliament should also be investigated by independent experts .    2.9208837592525025
this will contribute hugely towards re - establishing the confidence of the european citizens in this institution .    2.9304242104392926
we at the european parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own house in order as well .    2.7978956276210356
only when all european institutions are reformed will we have the open , democratic and decisive europe which our citizens now finally deserve .    2.516316787096873
mr president , i also wish to congratulate mr van hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the house .    2.7141531342376854
i am sure that it will serve , amongst other things , to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups .    2.6097435448909474
at this stage , there can be no delay in the process of reforming the commission , demanded by our citizens .    3.1130464226458945
this parliament has often heard the desire to reform the commission expressed , even by its presidents .    2.7904179507289584
it now appears that this desire is more serious .    2.4696112065244455
after the resignation of a commission and after a committee of experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies , it makes sense that mr prodi should have promised , on 14 september , to present this parliament with a complete plan for reform by february .    2.2265678208467357
this parliament UNK awaits this complete reform programme .    2.3385463491283707
the report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the committee of experts commissioned by this parliament .    3.1111035329008208
mr prodi said he would act anyway , that he preferred to get things right , but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting .    2.165505594053824
we therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and , if it is , i can assure him that he will have the support of this house in the reform process .    3.711645093870902
we want a strong commission , which can act in an independent and neutral manner , but with political sense .    2.9756475731978957
commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office .    2.6970892935814494
therefore , the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies UNK to their parties .    3.112213936881909
perhaps the reference to the posts is UNK .    2.9503014606123927
i do not know your exact view in this respect , mr kinnock , but it is clear that we want commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed .    2.8780050537096966
we want a structure which allows every euro to be spent effectively , and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present .    2.6666476488458684
therefore , commissioner , we ask mr prodi to present us with a bold programme , and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat , but not with this parliament , which expects profound and daring changes .    2.804688971251523
mr president , the santer commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line .    1.9889905258742389
therefore , the future of this new commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order .    2.390672089378684
as far as this is concerned , a number of people have already referred to the fact that the commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow - up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis , with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future .    2.930009512696385
what i do not understand is why this has to come at a price , as it were , that is , of having to UNK with independent - and i stress , independent - prior approval .    3.4942407450246638
up until now , the commission ' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa .    2.693745263524795
and so it is the " two key " principle that applies here .    2.936234528419449
a single key is to suffice in future .    2.375300509392796
the financial controller is no longer to make advance checks , if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the commission .    2.5513575328109828
if you will pardon me for saying so , mr kinnock , what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes .    2.722732907578211
what we really need to focus on , however , is making the checks more effective .    2.8836842845953345
this could be achieved by no longer insisting , in future , that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp .    2.700318092352985
it is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all .    2.4333460538849376
therefore , in future , prior approval should take place in a targeted manner , that is , only in cases of uncertainty or risk .    2.988673890898511
the officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis , that is , in the operational directorates - general , amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money , so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less UNK and time - consuming .    2.7321675702965624
however , the financial controllers must work UNK .    2.775398716205594
that is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the commission , when it talks in terms of decentralisation .    3.5840431305374514
it is obviously the commission ' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual directorates - general , but this is precisely what we do not want .    3.532164834676203
surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the leonardo affair , when the internal UNK in the relevant directorate - general issued warnings , but these were neither heeded nor passed on .    2.3926673512741727
therefore , independence is prerequisite for effective checks .    2.297276396772286
that is the position which a clear majority of the committee on budgetary control UNK to .    3.0194416240806867
indeed , the new commission has now declared itself in favour of follow - up checks having this independence , and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well ?    2.7597740624118705
i believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow ' s vote .    2.6459377348455213
mrs theato has already expressed as much and i am only too willing to support her in this regard .    2.822636823721958
mr president , a couple of years ago , the previous commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures .    2.6566253416152286
this led to strikes and smear campaigns by UNK trade unions , whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a UNK - UNK compromise .    2.2828214207523567
this was stupid of the old commission , and parliament was of no help on that occasion .    2.81682627029604
when i read mr van hulten ' s passage about personnel policy , i am afraid that parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just UNK a lot of hot air .    2.584880354811671
there are too many rights , too many regulations and too little room for leadership .    2.438270024481552
there is no backbone , and no teeth .    2.694578367023527
where is the beef ?    2.6340463364770965
and i would also say this to you , commissioner : please , deliver the beef even if it is british .    3.4634216150698416
romano prodi promised a revolution .    2.575896432634502
you have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself , but take care now that you do not UNK the crucial issues , the ones where it hurts !    2.4568327828158965
sort out the UNK of staff UNK .    3.545871948375005
stand firm on the demand for mobility , not as a right , as it says here in the report , but as a management tool .    3.253338401825452
ensure too , that training becomes a management tool .    2.615083493387953
do not listen to the report ' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed .    2.7598122710598894
it is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis .    2.096859153398308
finally , mr president , as a member of the bureau until six months ago , i would urge you to address this issue in the bureau so that we here in parliament at least comply , in our own administration , with the demands we are making on others .    3.520404045661208
we have not done this so far , and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing .    3.3485428621351696
mr president , i want to thank mr van hulten for his report and to say that i voted for it .    3.134960301548567
so i refer to the things i do not agree with .    3.433486226630054
i do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to parliament .    2.9871355337833174
this report is about the commission .    3.7514045420547752
parliament is a separate subject .    3.1107118440766643
there is no need for us to bring parliament into the discussion on the commission .    3.0814429177448064
in addition to that , there is the question of duty - free .    3.543923097488443
that was a stick used to UNK the commission by the duty - free lobbies who UNK the fact that the commission abolished duty - free in airports .    2.9548144186323433
it is not worthy of being brought into this report either .    2.6062414978880164
most of the report is about financial control .    3.889853651966035
that is reasonable because it comes from the budgetary control committee .    2.415865672840243
but we should not create the impression that vast amounts of european resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the european commission .    3.0586676680508456
after all , it is only 1 % of gdp , by comparison with national spending .    2.953605079078392
we have had all that before but some people in this parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the european union are and that 80 % of these resources are spent by the member states .    2.866365094530495
so carelessness within the commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money .    2.8373553176002417
we should get it into perspective .    2.63518193566107
it is important to remember that .    2.9563446651173226
the business of the european commission is very little about spending money .    3.793447191512699
they have very little of it .    2.6114458491535704
they have a much wider responsibility .    3.052181764050748
that wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment , food safety , foreign trade , the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them .    2.9873259690581517
i am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust .    3.4888106025975425
if there is , we have generated it in this house in the past year .    4.5859502894710165
i have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the council , the commission and parliament .    3.019595491843802
we have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic commission was UNK , UNK and feared by the citizens of the european union because they were UNK our affairs .    3.023869934571208
that is a gross UNK of what the difficulties were .    2.6933692214757174
this commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the commission that went before it .    2.9147679680835266
while there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far .    3.0295746337978886
mr president , i should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report .    2.544662317839583
i hope that the commission will use it in its reform work .    2.7791814923982043
the process of reform has been going on for some time , and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the commission .    2.8490243101367314
the commission ' s administration simply does not function particularly well .    2.411747296380239
naturally , there are good , capable employees in the commission , and they are in the majority . but we need radical reform .    3.9002362714033647
there is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy .    2.423235823149749
people should have clearly - defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable .    2.754514777794732
the financial regulation should be amended .    3.184668788482354
we agree that we should have better control of the finances .    3.311088396453987
it is just a question of how .    3.608817471112836
the commission and the committee of independent experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control .    2.851342181615497
we should be careful about this .    2.943321273948448
we should retain some form of ex ante financial control .    2.4456463326942077
it is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent .    2.3475392660660837
this would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through .    2.26274883155696
instead , we should be reforming and UNK control .    3.0611944222434984
the commission does not have enough staff .    3.0663687787403964
as members of the european parliament , we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the commission ' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it .    3.412976546966601
and the commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs .    3.2890322029613475
the staffing system is too rigid .    2.5253431461904245
there should be a more frequent rotation of employees , especially at the top of the hierarchy .    2.510264043029375
it should also be much easier to sack inefficient and UNK employees .    2.5607805849740317
i am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed .    3.106136453153185
after all , the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms .    2.4487770796707373
mr president , commissioners , first of all , i cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is , on the whole , a dutch - british - UNK debate where the speakers are concerned .    2.9020920302916977
perhaps this is a little worrying .    4.050763542529596
i hope , like so many others , that the state of emergency in relations between the commission and parliament is on the way to being resolved .    3.95159328361519
we must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner , only then to have to rush again to put out the next one . as mr UNK said , we must instead establish a system with clear roles .    2.739118911980913
first of all , we need tough regulations , which can be implemented .    3.2998743657085092
codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough .    2.55471497577649
there need to be tough rules stating , among other things , what may be decentralised , what may be UNK and what is independent .    2.942558184010708
i find it a little worrying that people are UNK for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision - making is to be exercised .    3.4235620652044636
what we need , then , are basic administrative regulations for the eu , for its institutions and for the eu in its relations with the member states .    3.7095338731775622
these are what are missing .    2.7693935211642966
we have asked for a public prosecutor ' s office and criminal law , but we also need administrative law for the eu .    3.3566366506494614
we should make a good deal of progress if the commission were to adopt , as binding regulations , the ombudsman ' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice .    2.645623740410285
the van hulten report is a step in the right direction , but it is not enough .    3.0009782053323333
secondly , we must also clarify our own auditing roles .    2.694018579602316
it is the european parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation .    4.010248632765781
we do not hunt down criminals . that is olaf ' s job .    2.679731848373438
tell me what national parliament , for example , is handed all preliminary investigation documents .    2.591616019217888
obstinate as i am , i also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the internet . otherwise , we shall not get anywhere in this fight .    3.075913484722464
mr president , i would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report .    2.611704985870005
i am pleased that i can address him now in dutch , now that mr van UNK UNK has just done so . otherwise i probably would have felt slightly guilty about this .    2.314464722446977
i would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement , also with its amendments .    2.5081707813540883
i am from the social committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic .    2.254276685869084
i think that this is also the case here , but i think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments .    3.049547436445938
i would also point out that our coordinator on the budgetary control committee is mr UNK ruiz , who is spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a spanish perspective .    2.426701510454634
mr president , one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is , to my mind , the rapporteur ' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration .    3.500940460615094
a very important proposal indeed .    3.154142447856785
i am only very surprised that the socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by mrs morgan , because she wants to scrap it altogether .    2.6813652311767573
i cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale .    2.3895404290577256
on the one hand , we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but , at the same time , mrs morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well , as a result of which , in fact , the entire content of this report UNK .    2.8479949884709073
i do not know whether this is to UNK mr kinnock , but i happen to know mr kinnock .    3.1332931732689593
he is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary .    2.386928573548815
in my opinion , such a far - reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary .    2.342208479540844
finally , the issue of officials .    3.6508614444179384
actually , i do not entirely share mr haarder ' s view .    2.9545312577607716
i do agree that the section on officials has , in fact , been completed totally inadequately .    2.7493749336977302
first of all , the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised . secondly , all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being UNK , and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement .    3.061521980114661
for example , we are currently looking into taos . this is a key point but , at the same time , we want to abolish temporary staff at the commission .    3.3363705139742583
these two considerations are UNK opposed to each other , and i really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table .    2.659261092681838
mr president , ever since UNK ' s ' republic ' , the western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts .    2.3101279287533534
our parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the european commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine , themselves , what its future should be .    2.364782519545296
in this second report , the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in parliament , which may have UNK to remove the european commission from office , since they shared the political UNK of some of its members .    3.0986455920838476
the experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the commissioners from belonging to political groups .    2.4658247280186796
according to the experts , parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the european commission . this task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life , and this should be a standing committee , not elected , presumably made up of another group of experts .    2.8148949912955206
in this , their second report , the experts tell us that italy is financed by the cohesion fund , that the erdf and the social fund represent two - thirds of the structural funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the structural funds come to the same thing . they tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the eaggf - guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the commission and to the member states .    3.173562675406507
this lesson in wisdom is 100 % ideology and 0 % knowledge .    2.0412479464208304
this will not help us to reform the european institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions .    2.9931677478765484
the van hulten report started out as a UNK one and i would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what mr van hulten achieved .    2.827561000757401
unfortunately , it was then changed , and changed for the worse , which turned it into a document which in fact , proposes something that we cannot accept .    2.826087328163929
mr president , mr van hulten , your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising , arduous and complex , and i believe this is important in a first report .    2.764335893567951
please therefore accept what i am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate , and i believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer .    3.198975986918051
this report seems to me to be redundant , long - winded , confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used .    2.2044174833580974
that is to say , if this parliament UNK a committee of experts - and i am not going to repeat what mr UNK has said , but i agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem , where is the sense in UNK in the UNK tradition of criticising the critics and so on , ad infinitum .    3.2408656054255705
clearly we are awaiting this reform from the commission , we are awaiting the proposals which the commission is going to make to us and this parliament will have to express its opinion on them .    4.3466306639300285
meanwhile , we have to offer the commission a vote of confidence .    3.6659484489912897
' long - winded ' .    2.9981829576911556
i am not going to mention the length of this report .    2.8588037076362234
i do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here , but , for this type of resolution it certainly does .    3.0843815611957894
i do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop .    2.6263347909886168
it is also ' confusing ' .    2.505649570248758
i am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning parliament .    2.852145555168099
that should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report .    3.379690569845176
and finally , mr president , frankly , i am not going to give examples , but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy .    3.1096249300081467
therefore - in summary - i await , and many of us await , your report , commissioner kinnock , so that we can really express our opinion on it , which is the duty of this parliament .    3.1479526798750865
when one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though , it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them .    2.881617542467524
hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by commissioners prodi and kinnock in plenary and in the committee on budgetary control .    2.2810153942831013
the concept of transparency stands out in the report .    3.213869784361077
securing this is a major priority .    4.010184509169879
the importance of smooth - running , comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough .    2.359317517873978
this is not just about bureaucratic reform , however ; rather , it is about showing good will towards the citizens .    2.87517889401081
we must win back their faith in eu politics .    2.234191767841545
the citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for eu provisions to be comprehensible to them .    2.6412816000856525
this is what enables them to understand what is going on .    2.4351386501614862
they want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served    3.187720155254126
whether or not the reforms succeed depends , to a very large extent , on the commission ' s own initiative .    3.4263209624350552
however , it UNK me when i heard today that the commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with parliament on an informal basis .    2.7685492813018175
however , mr kinnock , your presentation to the committee on budgetary control this coming tuesday must not just be a one - way street ; rather , as parliamentarians , we want , and must , play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when i find that yet another press conference has taken place this week , before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent committee on budgetary control .    2.463116759775373
i believe , mr kinnock , that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level , the commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations .    2.79195402040808
can i begin by stating for the record and for the UNK of mrs UNK that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the commission ' s - it was the decision of this parliament !    3.5356741353937076
so if she has any UNK to offer they are best contained within this house .    2.1793470292986115
she knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this house , there has never been a single occasion on which i have refused to account in full , formally and in detail for everything i have done .    2.8077958467853987
mr president , may i begin by paying tribute to the UNK and , from what i hear , the pains - accepting work of mr van hulten in preparing his report .    2.5030246872778847
although new to this house he is relatively old in some respects , certainly in his familiarity with the institutions as a former official - and i think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance , as several members have said , to all of our institutions .    2.8539361405139956
i thank him and i wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative .    2.440901110248624
mr president , as you will know , mr van hulten ' s report on the second report of the committee of independent experts is necessarily long and , since i want to make a comprehensive reply , particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control , i seek your UNK .    2.9394255993173317
naturally i will not take up any more of the time of the house than is absolutely necessary .    3.101995094694201
when this house considered the second report of the committee of experts last september , i pledged on behalf of the incoming commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the commission ' s reform proposals .    3.040978458715256
our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the house when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the commission today , well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago .    2.387339259584985
i am sure that mr UNK ruiz is encouraged by that .    2.3930734594309158
the great majority of the paper ' s proposals are closely akin to those put by mr van hulten and that paper includes - i say to him and to mr staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform .    2.422838652851857
there is nothing therefore that is open - ended or vague about the report which i have had the honour to compile .    2.6025576370683123
the considered view of this parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance .    2.7877576514417344
i would say to mr elles that we are most definitely in listening mode .    2.7557430262765354
but he will appreciate - with his customary generosity i am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing , it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing .    3.4066640978198364
though time UNK me , mr president , from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the house , i readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas .    2.6650666443105315
turning to the main themes of the resolution i offer the following observations .    2.7413352931842194
the need for transparency is rightly stressed , not least because greater transparency in the way in which the commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also UNK what the commission does .    3.3953212978788025
this is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this house , but more generally to the european public .    3.5695422711845026
naturally , sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information , but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible .    2.442559124899962
i have repeatedly emphasised that , indeed not just as a commissioner , but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning .    2.5625200114624596
that most certainly is the intention of the commission .    2.888291347764115
financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform .    2.9986771287233194
as the house knows and has repeatedly said , the scale and scope of the union ' s financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures .    2.3890381147547894
several members have made that point again in the course of today ' s debate .    3.081134444684812
we share the view , forcefully expressed by the committee of independent experts , and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures .    2.4783872395246296
the means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the financial regulation in april .    3.601457312048206
parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital .    2.176049590550565
i share the view expressed by mrs theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law .    2.980663976784923
change in the law is fundamental .    3.262243657881601
there are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy , but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system .    2.961030184134948
essentially - and with legal change - the commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the financial controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that directors - general are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the european union budget .    2.5264139602442532
in addition , and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system , the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - " the second key " as herr bösch said , established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the committee of experts .    2.7349171357393605
that service will open on 1 may this year .    2.353528634858074
it will be headed by a UNK qualified member of the audit UNK and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation .    2.6988471437559745
the new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an audit progress board chaired by my colleague , mrs schreyer , who i am delighted to see in the chamber this evening .    2.738431901275398
as budgets commissioner , here responsibilities already include relations with the court of auditors .    2.5575281093237674
this audit progress board will ensure effective and rigorous follow - up to internal audits .    2.4051260318555583
i want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them .    2.124777845861036
the proposed change will make the systems more effective , both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes .    3.049975871239181
i can also specifically assure the house that we are not going for what is sometimes called " a big UNK approach " .    2.703124908493132
i am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the committee of independent experts .    2.7065534264488695
that committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa .    2.9057717022449183
it was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control .    2.6271366195158907
in addition , i do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the court of auditors in 1997 .    2.788234408590477
naturally the court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the financial regulation but it is useful to recall mr UNK ' s comments to this house last month . " the commission ' s internal control " he said " is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation .    3.062239952621045
for instance , the financial controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered .    2.4867256135051212
at the same time , the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies , notably the same financial controller , the UNK general and by some units operating directorates - general . "    2.476176086543487
the centralised ex ante approval system was UNK originally designed to ensure UNK but , over the years , it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions .    2.5579897267032874
i do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this .    2.6153395193687206
i take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying UNK of honourable members is that there should be a carefully managed transition .    2.385649814498951
that will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable members will see when they read the reform strategy document .    2.4167463976800883
our objective , the committee ' s objective , the court of auditors ' objective is not to abolish financial control , it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control .    3.3930780369323097
before leaving this area i would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months .    2.9252358841446604
turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by commission officials of perceived wrong - doing .    2.4330111901248923
as i made clear in the hearings last september and on other occasions , we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed .    2.918504716578357
since june of last year , the olaf regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities .    2.2096514733894246
the possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed .    2.9775099973229113
we are seeking to implement best practice .    2.5395640555499703
serious response to reports , confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong - doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure .    1.906284361299577
a communication later this year will give full details .    2.5118260634184515
i do not think parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose .    2.5974975241666836
i am persuaded , however , by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability .    2.612423356069243
we already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness , fairness , consistency and professionalism .    2.230352410604928
and we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional disciplinary board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of parliament .    3.0433587383941223
standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the house .    3.2631061904518384
with the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework .    2.704060115767231
this will be taken a step further with a proposal in june for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life .    2.6520497865823796
that is in line with the draft resolution .    3.2518067794004963
an important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions .    2.7290892594213814
i welcome parliament ' s support for that .    3.2734649193096366
we are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents , made in paragraph 50 of mr van hulten ' s report .    2.341164291261677
the draft resolution rightly UNK the commission ' s accountability to this parliament .    3.238605422692125
president prodi and vice - president de palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the commission ' s practical commitment to that .    2.7396709487156072
i hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents .    2.8112269963670484
we are now waiting for parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text .    2.60984755088303
we are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible .    2.480515378394987
the report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform .    2.2857862189723215
i am glad to say to mr van hulten and mr haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment , training , appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals .    2.530344392127161
i also want to move towards a UNK career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions .    2.4708379974089456
it certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities .    2.1583051629150503
members , who , in the course of this debate , have properly praised commission officials , who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity , hard - working and of great capability , are absolutely right in the comments that they have made .    2.7513035165522677
while the reform strategy white paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points , detail and precision are obviously essential .    2.13752777872607
a series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months .    2.894780618769999
each of them will be available for reflection and response by this house .    2.681555201287825
it is , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with parliament , as an institution , on central matters of common interest , notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations .    2.7158434451457483
on this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay , conditions , staff representation rights and so on , but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters .    2.0762845881291367
the early thoughts of parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome .    2.26755899392118
i conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the house relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change .    2.620273593239561
that is most certainly relevant .    2.6236993273584766
we are sure that there will be an important " reform UNK " as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources .    2.5939174378210534
it is very clear , however , that parts of the commission services are already very stretched .    3.918868392485235
parliament has frequently made that point .    2.6457977539633477
secondly , it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology .    2.4540879252947323
thirdly , it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken .    3.059818568761844
they are already having implications for resource availability .    2.3941494895854363
a central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority - setting into resource allocation under a system of activity - based management .    2.7385077126536506
i want to emphasise , however , that whilst internal discipline on priority - setting will certainly be introduced by the commission , it can only be fully effective if parliament and the council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the commission .    3.0704686344138037
the commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of mr van hulten ' s report .    2.3761388389140747
i conclude , mr president , by thanking the house for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur , to the committee on budgetary control and to the other committees which gave their opinions .    3.0322320524483177
we look forward to working closely with this house on the UNK of the reform strategy package and then , most important of all , working together with this house on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities .    3.0372731813564067
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.6677986406930794
( the sitting was closed at 11 . 15 p . m . )    1.9386329213663347
middle east peace process ( continuation )    2.7869147301274277
the next item is the continuation of the council and commission statements on the middle east peace process .    2.8987883420425247
i am very grateful to the president of the council for the statement this morning on the middle east at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of minister gama ' s insights , as he arrived hot - foot from the region .    2.647128927217732
my only regret is that my own commitment to open the european reconstruction agency on monday meant that i could not take part myself in that trip to the middle east , even though , as i mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events UNK to UNK me at munich airport rather than transport me to UNK .    2.3136435473372647
such is life .    2.9467269965359835
i hope that honourable members will excuse me if i am not able to stay to the end of the debate as i would , in all normal circumstances , wish to do .    3.04656941674514
the debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis i had arranged to see visitors from the balkans this evening .    2.188857293637552
it is not something , i assure you , which i would wish to make a practice of .    3.463213476716915
like honourable members , i welcome the united states ' efforts that have UNK the syrian / israeli negotiations , despite the syrian decision that they needed more time before UNK the talks that were scheduled to start again today .    2.5647520834975026
there is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future . i also hope that progress in the syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of lebanese / israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on israel ' s relations with its northern neighbours .    2.2506757254083083
at the same time we must not lose sight of the palestinian track .    2.703617473925213
the situation of the palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict .    3.0983835794355503
a fair and , indeed , generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the middle east .    2.7053633516827658
israelis and palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the sharm el - sheikh memorandum .    2.253989329143594
although there has been some slippage , i trust that the remaining israeli UNK UNK will materialise soon .    2.4844669629253113
similarly , despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the framework agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid - february deadline , i very much hope that the much more important september deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached .    2.4533906734186095
i was reassured that this was also the view of prime minister barak and president arafat , when they met on monday .    2.4336810350613916
honourable members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track .    2.6716125197988907
this is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible , in close liaison with the us and russian co - UNK as well as the regional parties .    2.815180417108593
we are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development .    2.920603156031041
the beginning of the talks with syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in moscow at the end of the month .    2.671260786301985
i look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again .    2.2197247836284903
the european union has an important role to play in the peace process , as all sides - palestinians , israelis , their arab neighbours and the united states - have acknowledged .    2.6479135674663237
nor is our role confined to that of banker .    2.7151632435951503
we must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region .    3.215269753870057
but we should not kid ourselves : a comprehensive middle east peace deal comes with a UNK price tag .    2.4949233123431465
the commission is already considering the implications for the european union of the recent encouraging developments .    3.3018526051377575
we intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with parliament and council soon .    2.8042631728847707
but let me remind honourable members that the european union is no UNK when it comes to financial support for the peace process .    3.4085264212262443
we are the largest of all donors to the palestinians .    2.6283218325780457
we have also offered very substantial support to jordan , lebanon , syria and egypt .    2.0185109902714946
with the israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them .    2.6592861356702353
the community contribution of over eur 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the west bank and gaza .    1.9607795340522367
european union member states together contributed another eur UNK million during that crucial period .    2.35429921316052
in this context , let me applaud the important steps that the palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency .    2.284857271328116
this will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law .    3.030682729173636
the commission is actively involved in those efforts .    2.88107601314744
the commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between israelis and arabs .    2.176914024552299
we committed more than eur 20 million for such projects last year .    2.389414934283241
this package included renewed assistance for people - to - people activities and cross - border cooperation where israelis and arabs meet on non - governmental and expert levels .    2.321522757303012
members will recall that the european union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the middle east .    2.8317091022202736
a number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them , helping to consolidate a golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the golan heights .    2.4373749277426975
syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a UNK to a peace economy .    2.7388403897586002
reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern lebanon , the only middle eastern area with an ongoing military conflict , will also demand considerable efforts . we also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in lebanon as a whole .    2.38635668350379
a solution is needed to the palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world , numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead .    2.732728682076288
we must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region ' s very scarce water resources .    2.8083077124696967
lastly , but maybe most importantly , we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas , bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems .    2.6992535249849876
it is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the UNK of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace .    3.4898928701654306
i want to underline that point .    2.6201973291601273
i wish UNK to remind the council and , should it be necessary , parliament , that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing .    3.3115771368187916
i repeat that a change in the politics of the middle east will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide . i hope i can add that we will want to provide that .    3.0978148193897685
we have made progress in recent months and weeks , as mr gama mentioned earlier .    2.779211927679172
we will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome .    3.0227635453907324
lastly , i will repeat for some who have entered the chamber in the last few minutes , what i said at the outset of my remarks : that i will not be able to stay until the end of the debate , largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the balkans for this evening .    2.9296465968943317
i hope the house will understand that .    2.8676930375652336
mr president , commissioner patten has our understanding .    2.3067199150042224
i would like to tell him that communications with madrid are usually more fluid and , therefore , i hope to see him there soon .    2.4971563415290943
the statements we have heard today on the middle east peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the UNK tour which minister gama - whose absence from this debate i also regret - has made of the region , accompanied by other council representatives .    2.6372447059834774
the tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a UNK view of the situation .    3.305424262171099
i honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation .    3.2244354321047215
in this sense , i share commissioner patten ' s positive attitude .    2.623371420376804
let me explain : it is true that the israeli government has delayed the third hand - over of west bank territory to the palestinian authorities .    2.3699281082798915
it is also true , however , that , since the signing of the sharm el - sheikh agreements , 39 % of the territory of the west bank has been handed over to the palestinian national authority , together with two thirds of the gaza strip and , more importantly , this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with , since , under the terms laid down in sharm el - sheikh , the israeli government has the right to delay that handover .    2.7465137966864717
this is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks , as prime minister barak has promised .    2.1786267688569425
on the other hand , the decision to delay the second round of talks , initiated in shepherdstown by the syrian arab republic , is undoubtedly significant , but i am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 january in that town will not be UNK .    2.356429101054909
mr president , the fact that the different groups in this parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution , in this ever controversial debate , which is the result of a broad consensus , seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes .    3.173762115888972
i would therefore like , equally firmly , to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences , which are still no doubt profound , between the parties .    2.694630407126972
in my judgement , this constitutes a guarantee to both sides , both from a political and a financial point of view , of the commitment they can expect from the european union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for .    3.3556464769621277
it is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to UNK the serious social differences which exist .    3.288886217733343
mr president , i want to thank commissioner patten for his detailed account .    2.390404311843046
i should like to say that i agree with the tone which galeote quecedo ' s speech set here .    2.5554286199291703
we in parliament strongly support the middle east peace process .    2.695488477285675
it is , of course , a peace process which is finally under way .    2.463548502520807
if we think of how the process was looking a year ago , the difference between then and now is like that between night and day , despite difficulties and delays .    2.378415413081448
first of all , the sharm el - sheikh agreement contains , as everyone knows , a concrete timetable for the implementation of israel ' s commitments . this applies both to the interim agreement and to the UNK and wye agreements .    2.7152709996278035
while the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun , i think it is important to keep the two processes apart .    2.984305635239379
a lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above - mentioned interim agreements .    3.257605991753852
what we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in gaza , the northern transit route between gaza and the west bank , further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments .    2.52669020247874
the second point relates to syria .    2.4891428400912505
there , the border question is obviously central .    2.4838291330586117
how negotiations are proceeding there , we still do not know .    2.838724622846577
what is important , however , is that they have begun .    4.469984679265271
as things are at present , the golan heights account for between a third and a sixth of israel ' s water supply .    2.51135766381577
the third aspect is the peace negotiations in syria which are closely linked to the issue of israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon .    2.6935195203239877
according to UNK , there are now concrete signs that israel is preparing to withdraw , which is something we welcome .    3.4911868156996806
there too , of course , outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the lebanese palestinian refugees .    2.713512913781511
my last point concerns the future palestinian state .    2.586220667080589
this may be proclaimed in the course of this year , with or without israel ' s support .    3.0161288659069427
the barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party .    2.6645369497531894
even if negotiations are not completed by september of this year , there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date .    2.566624207194663
this is something to which we all want to contribute .    3.3805885627319667
mr president , i would like to refer , firstly and above all , to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate . my group has made a contribution to this resolution and , needless to say , approves of it .    2.9895548401814795
more specifically , however , i would like to express our delight at the fact that , after such a long time , israel and syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion .    2.979073777744679
the recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the middle east .    2.468320008642028
it is , therefore , regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being .    2.4213195927868143
indeed , both parties will need to make huge efforts .    2.9548319394466414
lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the israeli borders , as well as syria ' s integrity .    3.22294930669786
it is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue .    2.437777459190676
in addition to the bilateral meetings with syria , i hope that israel will also enter into negotiations with lebanon within the foreseeable future and that , in the framework of economic and regional cooperation , a multilateral approach will appear possible .    2.7456214935908054
nevertheless , it is still regrettable that the european union , one of the most important financial donors , is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process .    3.783284626381174
this peace process in the middle east is one of the priorities of the european union ' s common foreign and security policy .    3.2484485466987403
this is where mr solana , the high representative to the council , could come into his own .    3.3285738818149797
the commission and member states also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region .    2.886519532959879
in this respect , we support UNK ' s participation , provided that it recognises human rights , UNK support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process .    2.7168841779685824
there are still , needless to say , many UNK problems and UNK questions , also involving the palestinians .    2.463117118513431
mr president , it is pleasing that , despite certain delays and problems , the peace negotiations are going on both between israel and palestine and between israel and syria .    2.3512911493166415
the moment of truth is approaching .    2.631557392374654
will israel let palestinian refugees return or be given compensation ?    2.1914362399524117
will israel share jerusalem and the water of the river jordan ?    2.28889236764427
will a free palestine be a truly democratic state and , therefore , reliable as a partner in peace ?    2.365756381335804
will syria fully accept israel ' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law ?    2.415161803979495
the fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country , israel , does not prevent the arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility .    2.6893148604649406
peace in the middle east concerns us all , however .    3.245718960060899
it is therefore good that the eu should act as a UNK to the palestinian state .    3.982173554604878
against this background , i want to conclude with a remarkable story from sweden where an international intergovernmental conference on hitler ' s UNK of the jews is being held , which is obviously a welcome initiative .    2.9248871834831456
of 47 states invited from all UNK of the world , not one of them , however , is an arab state included in the eu ' s barcelona process .    3.87306131815625
this has been interpreted as indicating that the arab attitude towards israel should be regarded by europeans as being similar to the nazis ' anti - semitism , which of course is completely incorrect .    2.110228865311484
the arab world ' s criticism of israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti - UNK as , for example , algeria ' s fight for freedom against france .    2.3781363249836733
but today , egypt , jordan and palestine have peace treaties with israel .    2.0228503131346667
i therefore wonder whether commissioner patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one arab state to the holocaust conference in stockholm .    2.485012539999733
mr president , i would like to thank commissioner patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the european union is taking on to bring it to completion .    2.629630945340399
it is high time there was peace in the middle east .    2.3546368538072433
it is time to end the era which began with the UNK declaration in UNK and the arab - israeli war of UNK . it is time there were secure borders and political , social and economic rights in every country in this region , and that human rights were recognised and upheld in syria , palestine , israel and everywhere else .    2.6841737983599634
this is an exercise in sovereignty , and in democracy for each population and every individual , but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights , and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given .    2.7778182768470163
i refer principally to the palestine - israel question , but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the golan since 1967 and in southern lebanon since 1982 .    2.368513818230289
israel has to accept its responsibilities , withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but , at the same time , it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area .    3.369207454285894
however , israel is not the only country concerned with security .    3.0105979703948313
the same goes for the other countries , especially for the palestinians , who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas b and c , despite the oslo agreement and subsequent agreements . between the period when the oslo agreement was signed and 17 october 1999 , UNK 000 UNK of land were confiscated , 8 UNK of which have been taken under mr barak ' s government .    2.3370238655988524
trees have been UNK , houses are still being UNK and , above all , water supplies have been reduced or refused , especially in east jerusalem , while the settlements continue and are growing constantly .    2.713826661021893
nevertheless , there is no doubt that with the election of the new government , positive steps have been taken : negotiations , at least , have resumed . but in the middle east , there can be no stable and lasting peace if the palestinians do not have their own state , if they cannot move freely within their own territory .    2.8286436162252757
all the international community has to do is implement resolutions UNK , 248 , UNK and UNK .    3.039001791475032
we are concerned by the UNK of the building of relations with syria , as well as mr barak ' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the israeli army and the sharm UNK - sheikh agreements .    3.011887999894131
we feel it is extremely important for the european union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid .    3.299834300991122
we cannot be content with a role UNK . we must be leading protagonists while staying off a UNK course with the united states , as minister gama said .    2.4966727913894142
i was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between israel and syria had been suspended .    2.2661448045007337
i very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date .    2.724365196895548
nevertheless , we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the middle east of late .    2.895723318062805
the fact that the syrian foreign minister and the israeli prime minister were recently sitting around the same table in america for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and UNK can be overcome .    2.257533468827857
political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the middle east .    2.4628650919918367
i know that if agreement can be reached between syria and israel , the israeli prime minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with syria in any future referendum .    2.1318222676271263
the UNK at the golan heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security .    2.9414781742054155
if syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the israel / syria question might be promising .    2.045803151582214
on the issue of palestine , i recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the wye agreement .    3.577411226888128
the key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of UNK , as well as the transfer of territories .    3.268777792384388
the low level of releases of palestinian prisoners and the fact that the israeli government appears to intend UNK implementation of building permits already granted , as well as not approving new ones , pose further obstacles .    2.3329116746486074
these issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations , although , i believe , these talks will not be held up indefinitely .    2.7569406659457947
at present , the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first , while the israeli government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security .    2.6154579396118263
currently , both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed .    2.4311178212416764
in conclusion , while other countries in the middle east have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process , now that the syrian government has been brought into the peace process , egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward .    2.8491884124574085
i sincerely hope that , in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the middle east , all the key protagonists will move forward quickly , in the very near future , so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved .    3.4421317087294585
mr president , the various motions for resolutions tabled in parliament more or less represent the situation in the middle east .    2.6527522955665614
there are those who are in favour of new agreements between israel and syria , but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the middle east issue .    3.402088264808791
indeed , the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability .    2.510992066078932
the time has come for israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories , at last recognising once and for all the authority of palestine , whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of UNK arafat .    2.1856578792062207
it is equally important not to lose sight of the iraq question , which no one UNK anymore , thereby UNK the problems of millions of women , elderly people and children , the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is UNK , to oblivion .    2.7502108766159803
i do not know what syria and israel will want or be able to do in reality , but i do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples ' lives as it does to the UNK of the cold , UNK , artificial UNK UNK in our UNK , which can UNK houses but not the world in the third millennium .    3.147579139576361
mr president , the israeli author , UNK oz , managed to capture very aptly the UNK atmosphere at the negotiating table between the israelis and syrians recently .    1.915576343026358
he was under the impression that the syrians thought that , in exchange for the golan heights , all they had to do was to fax the israelis a receipt .    2.4181463860837122
oz ' s impression is also echoed in the israeli press .    2.2938383222817413
it contrasts prime minister barak ' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude , even physical absence , of the strong man of UNK , president assad , at the negotiations in the united states .    2.6428160628789885
surely assad would be barak ' s ideal negotiating partner and not the foreign affairs minister .    2.4623533323047404
and the israelis were certainly not impressed by the UNK behaviour of minister UNK al - UNK in shepherdstown .    2.44730861684407
his behaviour towards prime minister ehud barak was plainly insulting .    2.1512811462519896
but why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic UNK in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory ?    2.432936679658784
well , the syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face .    2.0835528798156893
at the end of the day , israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the golan .    2.36963575360277
all the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater european involvement in the peace process .    2.3891491800888796
it is , however , very much in doubt whether brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the israeli and syrian authorities require from their peace UNK , the united states , not to mention the heavy , equally costly , security guarantees in case of an israeli withdrawal from the golan .    2.351453141201278
i would like to finish off by asking the european council and commission a question .    2.6599047950347994
how accurate are the press reports which state that the portuguese presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the golan ?    2.684132319946528
mr president , the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between syria and israel is not good news , but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people .    2.1456077440182746
it is clear that , for once , the united states has not been able to secure progress on the UNK of these negotiations , and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome : the syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the golan heights and re - establish the borders which existed before 4 june 1967 , while the israelis wish , since they consider that it UNK their situation better , to have the borders which were set in UNK .    2.8947169638267454
the suspension of the talks between syria and israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the middle east .    2.6762750293956636
the application of the framework agreement between the palestinian authorities and israel is also suspended at the moment .    2.8813770250553867
after the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the israeli prime minister and the leader of the palestinian authority , the israeli prime minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 february , the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the west bank and the gaza strip .    2.762378768087765
what can the european union do in these circumstances ?    3.736319260341089
unfortunately , very little .    2.8330580098440974
it naturally has to support these negotiations , sponsored by the united states ; contacts have to be increased ; the presence of the european union envoy , ambassador moratinos , who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency , within the powers of the european union , is positive .    3.0308785635055377
but none of this UNK the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence , because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the united states this weekend , we will have to remember that , for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region , 60 are contributed by the european union .    3.070357438032019
when we consider that a conference will soon be held in moscow , it becomes clear that the european union ' s presence in this peace process is somewhat UNK .    3.108739676559756
i would like to insist to the portuguese presidency that we must play a greater role , that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the european union in this process .    3.2342365757144735
i hope that the forthcoming visit by the president of the european parliament to the region , as well as the presidents of the relevant UNK delegations , will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the european union in this complicated and difficult peace process .    2.938156442304856
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner patten , i should like to thank you for your statements , especially commissioner patten , whose analysis i fully share and i shall not , therefore , repeat any of his ideas .    2.5081585041725716
i should just like to make three comments which commissioner patten will perhaps see as similar but which , for various reasons , a member can formulate more openly .    2.340810495596813
first , i believe that we can welcome the agreement between israel and the palestinian authorities .    3.2632372680254313
but we have enough agreements now : oslo , wye UNK , sharm el - sheikh .    2.0968442408423518
we have enough agreements ; they just need to be implemented .    2.924997976265896
however , in this regard i share mr salafranca ' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from israel this week , namely that the sharm el - sheikh memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe .    2.3393483887431006
my second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between syria and israel .    2.3951168066214144
i consider this to be very encouraging news .    2.945201599954205
but we have also learned this week that mr barak will not be travelling to washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued .    2.855563715429497
i should like to make it quite clear : if the golan heights are returned to syria , the problem in this region will be solved .    2.544207508937938
on the question of the referendum which various members have referred to : we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations .    3.0541999992268836
in germany , there would probably be UNK in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the european union and we shall pay if the german people are prepared to pay .    3.4565558520181643
that would be a similar situation .    3.3164993117931227
my third and last point concerns the role of the european union .    2.7979772366582454
you know that you will always have our support here in parliament , and that includes your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it .    3.457475299743266
but we must also play a political role and mr moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own ; the presidency of the council must take action , the eu high representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves .    2.6487657051356446
then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution .    2.603231746974134
mr president , commissioner patten , the recent peace talks begun in the usa between israel and syria mark a turning point in the history of the middle east . it has taken fifty years to reach this point , which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations .    2.5771856006740665
there will be no meeting today in shepherdstown but we must hope , as mr patten said just now , that this UNK of the negotiations due to syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the middle east .    2.9792603185560314
this hope is contained in our motion for a resolution . we hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live UNK within safe and recognised borders .    2.4571755397071775
all the foreign troops , including therefore the syrian forces , must withdraw from lebanon in accordance with resolution 520 of the united nations security council .    2.2755790640946785
dare we hope for an israeli withdrawal from south lebanon by july 2000 , the date promised by ehud barak ?    2.2078933904550704
dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between israel and its neighbours to the north ?    2.5519273810094854
we really hope and believe so .    2.530770489860745
never have the parties been so determined .    2.5585016258399653
one fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from europe and which must exist between the people . there must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations .    2.894381975166773
following the attack in UNK on monday , we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism .    3.042952032890586
in terms of balance , or should i say imbalance , i must add that it is to be regretted that europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict .    3.075111709434598
at UNK , mr gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by europe to the region .    2.94221611368575
despite everything , we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of washington .    3.8882749334511932
like other arab countries before them , the syrians chose the americans to sponsor the negotiations .    2.1560544922232623
this was the choice also made by israel where europe suffers from a partisan public image , and this is a fact , not a judgement .    2.703148957786987
this is now the opportunity to reiterate to mr patten , mr solana and mr moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict .    2.910831585474876
although it is difficult for europe to speak with one voice about the peace process , it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity .    3.0781417954763812
the next item is questions to the council ( b5 - 0040 / 99 ) and the commission ( b5 - 0041 / 99 ) , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom , security and justice ( article 39 of the teu ) .    2.6052128630967126
mr president , 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam , of the communitisation of the schengen agreement and of the extraordinary tampere council .    2.8950833294901273
these have been the most important moments in the council ' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom , security and justice in the european union .    2.983572501712399
the council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens ' rights - and we UNK in this ; it has decided to implement article 13 of the treaty , combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia , and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence , as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the union .    2.8106308765942565
it has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation .    2.6068235111176046
this has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a community framework .    2.776458319942202
they have been put into the hands of a single commissioner , mr UNK vitorino , and we congratulate them on this as well .    3.3864125813754233
furthermore , they have taken on the task of creating a " scoreboard " to verify the progress made in this area at community level , but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the member states .    3.516277225650612
we are pleased about this and we congratulate the council on these decisions , despite the fact that , for this house , the treaty of amsterdam included one disappointment : that of delaying , for five years , our role , our ability to participate actively , to democratically control this area of freedom , security and justice , as well as the role taken in it by the court of justice .    2.7711471705493724
however , if , on UNK the progress made during 1999 , which is within the competence of this parliament in accordance with the treaty , we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out , the scene looks considerably darker , mr president .    2.879479407316011
it is as if the council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to , the other UNK .    2.533065616892714
despite all the commitments made at the highest level , the council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged .    3.4920034654589647
programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or , at least , this parliament is unable to do so .    2.9287806565319867
we have presented the council with a series of questions and i know that it is the will of the portuguese presidency to answer each and every one of them .    3.674591869137711
we hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the council towards this parliament .    2.965394496483445
i said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the council and the policies actually carried out .    3.294303502118597
there are doubts in my group and doubts also persist in this house , for example , about something which should be good news : the incorporation of the schengen agreement into the community framework .    2.755772460429594
schengen has been incorporated , as we said earlier , into the acquis , but it has been done with very little transparency .    3.2448141470068057
not a single piece of information , nor a single consultation , has been addressed to parliament during this process ; neither on the association of the united kingdom , nor on the incorporation of greece , nor on the negotiations with norway and iceland .    2.3903301661786562
the same is true with regard to immigration policy .    3.1482238779569856
we have UNK ourselves with a pile of reports , but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives ; they have disappeared .    2.8541656284422503
we hope that 2000 will be the year for action , in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations .    3.241003659285436
we hope that the council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this parliament .    3.065634024440771
the council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the union .    3.15402229023544
the council can act in accordance with parliament ' s decisions , or it can continue to miserably UNK its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project .    3.0493749294656616
alternatively , it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions , in order to move forward in another way .    3.0640013598226883
fulfil your obligations to parliament in a generous spirit , thus preparing for the future .    2.476611480479442
provide the commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at community level and at the level of the member states , and we will be - and the council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at tampere and move towards a union which is freer , more just and more secure .    3.2707760482863435
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as i do not have a background as a member of the european parliament , you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague fernando gomes .    3.392324210792732
as mrs terrón i cusí said in her speech , 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the treaty of amsterdam , an expectation realised with the conclusions of the tampere council , and a fundamental expectation , as from this year , that will be realised in the form of specific actions .    2.6866013534898605
we are all aware that , to this end , it is essential for the council to approve , as quickly as possible , the scoreboard which commissioner vitorino has the remit of establishing .    3.0348919086086443
i must stress once again the portuguese presidency ' s UNK desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal council in lisbon on 3 and 4 march .    2.6951980474223114
turning to the specific questions that mrs terrón i cusí has put to us , i shall group them into three basic areas : the fight against organised crime , the operation of the judicial network , particularly as regards criminal matters , and questions on europol .    2.584577688596256
regarding the fight against organised crime , 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the vienna action plan , which resulted in the signing of the charter of european professional associations , in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the member states for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering . and i must not forget the finnish presidency ' s proposal for a council decision which is being considered in the multi - disciplinary group .    2.747909753467447
this is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work , not just by securing approval for the eu strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium , but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the UNK of views that exists , particularly at council level , on issues concerning the fight against organised crime .    3.1916080383367516
with this in mind i must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the french presidency , with the aim of organising a UNK UNK - ecofin council .    2.7270764225584574
our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime .    2.8354341303077124
here , in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the pre - accession pact , it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the european union and the russian federation , a plan which is now being finalised , and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the member states , in moscow , and to develop a set of further initiatives .    3.3894273299244575
another area is eu involvement in the united nations convention against transnational organised crime and its various protocols , and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the council of europe , in particular on UNK crime .    3.475312063401528
as this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme , the presidency believes that it is worthwhile , bearing in mind the principles of chapter vi of the treaty , to explore suitable means of providing the european parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the united nations convention .    3.124659266446811
with regard to the judicial network , significant progress has been made , in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the european judicial network , whilst the multi - disciplinary group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan .    2.918251368374775
however , we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium , so as to give a fresh impetus , while preserving continuity , to the work done under the previous action plan .    3.5153880852418258
still on judicial cooperation , considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro , and the european parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance .    3.5305367280453805
we believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible , we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments , and we should accordingly make a combined effort in march to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects , including those UNK in initiatives already presented by france and those whose adoption the commission itself has called for .    2.6668750491146236
it is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions , and we believe that on the basis of work already done , it will be possible , at least in the field of UNK of assets , for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions .    3.4894734574456687
lastly then , europol , which started its work in 1999 . the council approved a set of instruments , with which parliament is familiar , to make europol ' s operations viable but , of course , the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of europol still remain , and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in tampere to reinforce europol ' s powers and , above all , to give it an operational dimension .    2.7256582868476547
the french presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of europol .    2.2047108560833353
the portuguese presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the eurojust network , since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of europol to be a matter for eurojust , this option cannot be ruled out at present .    2.544875394039639
for this reason , it is essential that the council ' s debates on the future of europol and eurojust should be conducted in parallel , so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also .    3.034145391872519
i believe that in this context , and in the context of the dialogue that the council and parliament will have to establish on the future of europol and eurojust , it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the council and parliament with regard to europol .    3.9301092698060294
we are familiar with parliament ' s views and we know that parliament is aware of the views of the council ' s legal advisers .    4.011391026825929
i believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of europol , and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved .    3.3612618473800606
mr president , members of the council , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , without wishing to compete with the ministers as regards emotions , i have to say that i am not moved , rather i am UNK to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time , and i just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the union !    3.1088481793810696
i would also like to thank mrs terrón i cusí for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice , and to thank all the members who , in their various committees , have actively participated in preparing this annual debate . i would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society .    2.7721488994990375
i believe that i can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the union on issues of freedom , security and justice .    2.364754855346163
it has already been mentioned that the treaty of amsterdam came into force in may and this parliament stated that the most far - reaching innovation in this treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom , security and justice .    2.7232826440658537
at the same time , it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms , and a logical and vital step in the development of the union , in the wake of the establishment of the internal market , the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy .    3.1269575502763844
this project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common union .    3.1895234268417423
and it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the european union , recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base , with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access , on equal terms , and in which our citizens can have real confidence .    2.686963680351582
the union ' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom , security and justice was confirmed at tampere .    2.533952383110022
i would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the european council , reaffirming the importance that the heads of state and government of the union attached to a fundamental project , together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality , following a progressive strategy , within a time - frame of five years , and that , above all , the three components of this area should be in balance : freedom , security and justice .    2.6330933005890853
1999 was also marked by the german presidency ' s initiative to draw up a european charter of fundamental rights .    2.8420530715588845
i believe that at the present stage in the european union ' s development , it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at european union level in a charter , so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens .    3.111775915652303
as i have already said on a number of occasions , i am in favour - the commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect , on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process , the common constitutional traditions of the member states and the general principles of community law , rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator .    3.2462414667815493
in my capacity as a representative of the commission , i will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of europe ' s common heritage .    3.4097692276009157
that is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged european union in the eyes of every european citizen , an enlarged europe based on respect for rights and freedoms , with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection , in other words , a union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies .    2.663857553261232
i must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999 - 2004 parliamentary term of the european parliament , that it was the year in which the new commission took up its duties and , as a consequence , the year in which a commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities .    3.452406635740996
in addition to these events , i would like to remind parliament of some items that were approved in 1999 .    2.743378019968279
in the field of immigration , borders and asylum , the commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the eurodac database , and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into member states of the european union with a view to reuniting families , as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the european union .    2.762393634691799
we also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the commission to open negotiations with iceland and norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the member states of the european union under the dublin convention to those two countries .    2.401912389664949
the commission made an active contribution to the work of the high level group on asylum and migration , and ultimately , in december , it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a european refugee fund .    2.456674217113275
in the field of judicial cooperation , the commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the " communitisation " of certain conventions . these were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters ( brussels i ) , the convention on jurisdiction , recognition and enforcement of judgements in UNK matters ( brussels ii ) , and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and UNK documents in civil or commercial matters .    2.2785921020396223
in 1999 , we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the european union , which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at tampere . this communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime , in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation , including the cost of justice .    2.772364265392814
we also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non - cash means of payment .    2.742922803296331
in the field of european union legislation on combating financial crime , the commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering .    2.899436717120421
in 1999 , europol took up its duties and we in the commission , UNK the portuguese presidency ' s statement today , sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to europol under the treaty of amsterdam , there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between europol and the relevant judicial institutions , and in particular eurojust .    3.111895144212739
in 1999 , the commission also presented its contribution towards a european action plan to combat drugs , which underpins the strategy approved by the helsinki european council .    2.6058680528652527
this list of actions , which is not exhaustive , should , here today , in the presence of the council presidency and of the members of this house , help to make it clear that , while 1999 was a year of consolidation for eu action in this key area , it also - i very much hope - represented the start of a new phase , marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice .    3.1513061182260826
for this reason , 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the eu ' s institutions respond to our citizens ' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement , with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection .    2.5427960759517925
in other words , 2000 will be a test of the political will to take amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political union for the next decade - a test for the council , for parliament and for the commission .    3.083689874410226
as i have already said , the commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the treaty of amsterdam , in the vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the tampere european council .    3.2503195893775017
this scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning . it will also , and above all , be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the european union ' s institutions towards the public .    3.044726973148569
it is for the public , therefore , that we are developing the area of freedom , security and justice .    3.308579777166349
i hope to have a debate with the european parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project .    3.4244867104729164
and we hope , during the portuguese presidency , to present the final version to the justice and home affairs council , taking account of the UNK that i have just mentioned .    3.7446236531540054
it is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions , and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny .    3.2319537017179463
for this reason , and i believe that this is a challenge we are all facing , i recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship , for legality and , ultimately , for democracy itself .    2.972837746209981
in addition to the scoreboard , i would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the commission intends to present during 2000 - and i would like to emphasise that i am delighted the portuguese presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom , security and justice as a priority in its work programme .    3.13242138364913
i hope that in conjunction with the portuguese presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , which is also the political message of tampere , and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies .    3.221240238586943
regarding immigration and asylum , the commission intends to present proposals for creating a community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees ; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the dublin convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis , in accordance with the treaty of amsterdam ; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the union ; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of UNK .    2.5166918791115784
i also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the high level group on asylum and migration , and to make progress in adapting community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses .    3.0219889391410866
furthermore , on the subject of crossing the external borders of member states , which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons , i shall , in the next few days , be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders .    3.1990852695337866
turning to judicial cooperation , in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non - contractual obligations , i sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross - border proceedings .    2.8469557519832387
i also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and UNK up cross - border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims , UNK claims and non - contested claims .    2.226933395858413
as a follow - up to the tampere and helsinki conclusions , the commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a european union strategy to combat organised crime .    3.2878830571458146
we will be organising and supporting actions including , in particular , the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters .    3.0351897314836207
the commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention , so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area , and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency ; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the community for this purpose .    3.0378416625628137
the commission will also support the presidency ' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering , an eminently cross - pillar issue .    2.541758075225946
the commission will fulfil the remit given to it at tampere to present proposals for approving definitions , criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings , economic exploitation of immigrants , and sexual exploitation of woman and children , with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication , notably the internet , for distributing child pornography .    2.2160931473172574
we are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime .    2.4890432376220066
the year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the european union drugs strategy 2000 - 2004 .    3.450184309446505
in this field the commission , in conjunction with the portuguese presidency and the european parliament , will give its full support to the interinstitutional conference to be held on drugs in february .    3.280579537999578
with regard to schengen , without wishing to UNK on the territory of the council , or more precisely the incorporation of the schengen acquis into the community framework , i would like to stress , on the topical subject of restoring border controls , that the commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of article 2 ( 2 ) of the schengen convention in order to reinforce its authority .    3.1726292345734692
the recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on article 62 of the treaty .    2.7074200168642117
as was emphasised at tampere , and as part of our preparations for the feira european council in june 2000 , we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross - pillar policy strategies , which strengthen the links between the union ' s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the union ' s position on the world stage .    3.1635471995380344
nevertheless , i must make it clear that all these actions will , of course , have to take into account the principles agreed at the helsinki european council concerning applicant countries , so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom , security and justice .    2.6438385198934338
lastly , i would like to state once again that the commission intends to be in the UNK position in presenting proposals for implementing the treaty of amsterdam .    3.3188111239653426
i hope that the commission and the council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself . as i have told parliament , the task before us is immense and ambitious , and the commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge .    2.9533636614510694
we hope that we can count on the support of parliament , and - why not say it - of the council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives , so that the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible , thus allowing us all to contribute , in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , to the realisation of this project , which is , without a doubt , the " UNK in the crown " of the treaty of amsterdam .    3.522745922973799
mr president , having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market , the house now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom , security and justice , a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other ' s competence .    2.4813475181645703
commissioner vitorino , although i would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable , words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the council has demonstrated towards us .    2.560216940191895
it looked , as mr schulz once aptly said in committee , as if the council understood the area of freedom , security and justice to mean an area in which the council has free UNK , security from parliament and the right to do and order as it will .    3.0085536106879927
minister gomes , i have , of course , heard what you have said and i hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the portuguese presidency .    3.659122339703245
i should like to raise three points which for us , as members of the ppe group , must be focal points when such an area is created .    2.928877964789114
the council must start by at long last ensuring that eurodac is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for UNK asylum seekers .    2.7403582453366657
as far as a european asylum law is concerned , a start was in fact made at vienna and tampere .    2.639971291969524
unfortunately , however , it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions .    3.257103209663481
i therefore call on the council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole union .    2.7929111377215956
similarly , it cannot be right for just a few member states willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent .    2.5682756357172094
agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda .    2.83123678006575
secondly : the introduction of a europe - wide fight against organised crime , including by europol and eurojust .    2.6657413649227624
the planned introduction of eurojust is one of our significant successes from tampere and must now be implemented UNK .    2.544589937570779
we welcome the fact that europol has finally been able to start work .    3.2369854943087524
however , the council should also bear in mind that , if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime , we do not only need to widen europol ' s remit , as decided at tampere ; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities .    2.9452234500473566
we are not just calling for more control , and more control over europol ; our UNK here is " less is sometimes more ! "    2.3994146212097123
with most of europol employees currently engaged in self - control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments , we may have a great deal of control , but it is inefficient control .    2.443819599926819
we want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the european parliament , without hampering the work of europol .    2.8144422245534684
at the same time , we support the establishment of a european police UNK as suggested in tampere as a step in the right direction .    2.4993352844904533
thirdly : the extension to parliament ' s rights in this context .    3.5074944475668404
if the establishment of such an area , in which the union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens , is only decided by UNK and bureaucrats , while the elected representatives of europe are reduced to following developments like a UNK watching a snake , then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens .    2.8738106917806556
there is therefore an urgent need to grant parliament codecision rights in this respect and , as we have already said , to strengthen the principle of democratic control .    3.9468707147791267
we want an area of freedom , security and justice for the citizens of europe , not against them .    2.713110916414242
i warmly welcome the fact that the portuguese presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown .    2.846876314802407
perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in kosovo the police they promised .    2.2365691561119863
the first is asylum .    2.6442872429235713
it is essential to establish a single european system , but one based on fairness , full respect for the geneva convention and decent reception conditions , including an end to routine detention .    2.72701586907337
decisions on asylum should take months - not years .    2.395300925740705
the second area is that of freedom : freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the union ; freedom of information ; freedom to vote for all who have european citizenship - and that includes not just member state citizens but third country nationals .    2.337412761819258
let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom , not just about repression .    2.6924877105476708
the last area i want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems .    2.605647200808468
eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty , the end of the nation - state , and so on . but the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in france , including british student , isabel peake , who was thrown off a train , shows why we need mutual recognition .    2.633384584151552
arrested and released in madrid , he is now being UNK after arrest in lisbon .    2.4917226859875274
whatever the eurosceptics say , it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters .    2.9288701138047655
finally , as has already been said , it is essential , and i hope that the igc will cover this , to move to codecision with the european parliament in these areas , with democratic and judicial scrutiny .    3.6684764939311227
mr president , all i can say about 1999 is this : how wonderful to feel the portuguese summer after the finnish winter .    2.3385723892816674
i hope that it works out .    2.646103215788857
the tampere summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular .    2.774445843758423
numerous questions are still outstanding .    2.720428192665852
answers are still awaited .    2.8090018338275002
since tampere , there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent .    2.5811509536146624
on the other hand , quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life .    2.5108876136921188
the creation of a charter of fundamental rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future .    3.1679404173260513
the europol agreement has now officially entered into force .    2.488583449335683
in tampere , the question of granting operational powers was discussed .    2.9810519161256166
we continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control .    3.1793161901296725
the agreement also attracts criticism with regard to eurodac .    2.93146739771026
parliament has amended the contractual text .    2.4903367341532014
care must be taken to ensure that the council complies with parliament ' s modus operandi .    3.8468312030577505
unfortunately , no initiatives have yet UNK regarding other matters and we still await them .    2.2671376594889665
europe as an area of freedom , security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors .    2.3420927987170495
and yet we owe this to the citizens of europe .    2.830512448166602
having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers , i am optimistic and i am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months .    3.5836667404579994
mr president , commissioner , the oral question tabled by mrs terrón i cusí shows that this house is taking a firm stance . indeed , six months after the election of this new parliament , we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of europe .    3.0071480385155214
i believe that the portuguese presidency can contribute positively to this .    2.9721178817209597
we are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom , security and justice , particularly social justice .    2.8714663100397297
yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their UNK for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems .    2.4039359597523493
this is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres .    2.1192082599847364
for europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity , we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged .    3.354234703704255
we should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees .    2.8781400173136142
the virtually systematic conditions of detention and the UNK of asylum - seekers are no longer acceptable .    2.9921351314649063
all asylum - seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with UNK effect .    2.2840200704283853
last week , and somewhat by chance , i witnessed , at UNK airport , a scene of rare violence in which two young women , admittedly illegal immigrants , were being returned to UNK .    2.046910019946718
they were treated like the worst criminals .    2.5454147762175747
they were stripped UNK and dragged along the floor by their hair , UNK by a UNK of state security police .    2.527780100803959
the portuguese presidency must put an end to this type of UNK behaviour .    2.987390859410444
our role should be to accompany , reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships .    2.461566497866469
the commission has proposed creating a european fund for refugees to which parliament was favourably disposed .    2.35354955285896
instead of all this UNK about the budget granted to this fund , we could take the decision to set this up .    3.051303336510817
the presidency and the council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in tampere , even though this summit provided an important basis .    2.706809526852071
likewise , we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide - ranging action .    2.5509590643577615
the laws against racism must be harmonised .    2.5453464320435453
what direction do you intend to give to article 13 of the ec treaty ?    2.8500766374554405
what do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women ?    3.1139943221481534
how do you aim to eradicate UNK , racism and UNK ?    2.3790754850157927
we must take the best from each of our countries .    2.986557328426927
when six european countries have granted the right to vote , the president of this house can venture to extend this right to vote , and eligibility to participate in the municipal and european elections , to all people from outside the community who have lived in europe for more than five years .    2.7028502681614572
the UNK of illegal immigrants in certain countries , including your own , must act as an example to others . these illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of UNK UNK , an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation , UNK them modern - day slaves .    2.2686585828424737
in more general terms , this presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants .    2.5708357251719254
immigration is too often a UNK for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses .    2.4255412367957154
how do you intend to make our people understand that , today like always , immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is , and will remain , essential in the context of population ?    2.8708005339689886
what action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum - seekers ?    2.794508751225164
mr president , there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice .    3.0476921849718543
the european union is an economic UNK but we are not in a position to UNK when it comes to our treatment of refugees .    3.1342306908564606
the level of racism in our society is terrifying .    3.053657388148695
ireland , for generations , sent her sons and UNK to places of safety throughout the world , but now when the celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations , we are showing a very ugly side to our character . racism in ireland is endemic .    2.163070645893734
it has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the european union for a long time .    2.882350315834862
we are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up .    2.857026314215903
there is a willingness but fear pervades , and to UNK this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in ireland but throughout the european union .    2.668768437446864
mr president , we take note that the excuse - making , reticent presidency , which , in recent months , has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today , has come to an end .    3.154675279462575
i totally agree with mr von UNK and mr schulz ' s remarks , and truly believe that the european parliament and the court of justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom , security and justice , without having to UNK from their own powers .    3.388241019478468
nevertheless , to avoid the customary UNK , which every six months has us UNK attacking the presidency of the council , maybe parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next intergovernmental conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years .    2.3734774171481283
the two identical - sounding questions which are under discussion are , of course , underpinned by a mantra of the kind which , in recent years , has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine - sounding , but pernicious .    2.4008629684975404
and our current eu mantra is afsj : area for freedom , security and justice .    2.031393998155977
behind this lies another ambition on the part of the commission and of the council and of the overwhelming majority of this house , namely to introduce such an area .    4.0380740473848595
and who is not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?    3.975549496555697
the problem is just that this is not something the eu can introduce by means of legislative UNK and other supranational resolutions .    3.0976693221654092
freedom , security and justice are the root system of any society , reflecting its history , corporate experience and political development .    2.1500547177829437
a system of this kind is not something the eu can introduce without society ' s sustaining damage as a result .    2.82863909012718
but it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security , freedom and justice .    2.311990618405882
the agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen .    2.5463846767579765
that is already secured by means of the various national legal systems .    3.304832303745321
the agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society ' s criminal law , policy on crime and administration of justice to the eu ' s control .    2.7601013251553503
it is concerned with increased integration which , as part of a UNK package , involves increased repression and control .    2.7823150938772168
you just have to think of all the resolutions concerning UNK UNK , schengen , eurodac etc . any democrat can spot two key problems .    2.5363240739574824
first of all , the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic .    2.715987427991047
how is it envisaged that the eu ' s institutions , which are already stretched well beyond their capacity , can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition ?    2.680552703154228
think of last year ' s UNK criticism of the commission ' s lack of UNK , ethics and accountability .    3.9824494964370345
it also , of course , finds indirect expression in the question .    2.749901716168161
but , secondly , the projects will put a UNK on , indeed will be UNK to , the national democracies .    3.2157321261046294
as long as the eu UNK around the internal market , only the body was being attacked . now , it is the soul .    3.1523034433589974
mr president , today the people of northern ireland see a strange UNK .    2.445574285286003
we had commissioner patten speaking in this house in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the british house of commons this afternoon , which has been accepted , will do away with the royal UNK UNK and its reserves and put the people of northern ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists .    2.5834606985620345
the UNK terrorists have not given up any of their weapons , nor have the UNK terrorists , yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community .    2.629439297121884
in 1998 , we had 55 murders .    2.80245957300227
in 1999 , we had 7 murders and that does not include the UNK bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured .    2.431901986824265
between 1998 and 1999 , loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people , while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people .    2.167044910811853
charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled UNK , while those against republicans totalled 97 .    2.009459044182759
since january 2000 , there have been six UNK by loyalists and two by republicans , loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults , one leading to another murder , while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults .    2.027488853005506
mr president , that situation cannot continue and needs UNK .    2.4669377427727066
mr president , the treaty of amsterdam has set an important objective for the union .    2.797491678715463
this is a task which all meps , the council and the commission must take on during this legislature : the creation , as has been said already , of an area of freedom , security and justice .    2.6662934998598375
the tampere council , the motor and UNK of this objective , has proposed certain goals , but five years , the time scale laid down for the implementation of chapter iv of the treaty , is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require .    2.916063974414639
my first point is that parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision - making process must be guaranteed , especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens , as the commissioner has explained very well .    3.50613979457797
my second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system , adopting common procedural rules and , above all , putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons .    2.7489044574668164
the recent laws on aliens adopted in my country , spain , and in belgium , are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy .    3.4853337677387315
my third and final point relates to the external activities of the union in the field of immigration and asylum .    3.3594929690432287
we must not and cannot give the impression that the union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants .    2.4278651012294046
we must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the east and the mediterranean area , but we must do so with rigour , with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions , which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to UNK in order to meet their most essential needs .    2.8164188374417147
finally , in relation to the charter of fundamental rights , the citizens of europe need to have a vision of citizenship .    3.1391688329980036
the euro , employment , even security , are not enough .    3.0048486083036536
they need a ' european soul ' , as a distinguished spanish professor once said .    2.655777122430018
mr president , unlike some of the previous speakers , i want to go back to the words of our portuguese ministers and mr vitorino .    3.363919193817075
this UNK ' s words were like music to our ears as mr UNK has said .    2.7913042293298496
as with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly UNK .    2.7762422236549598
many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months .    2.480713751045646
as described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant UNK we heard during the european election and over the last few months .    2.425431508310487
the amsterdam treaty and the tampere council built on this project for an area of freedom , security and justice in the european union .    2.6010805503221595
one area though is extremely important , and this house must be involved in it : namely scrutiny .    3.564306386805656
there is so much legislation - and i very much welcome the portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised , that the people in this parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of europe are aware of everything involved in it .    3.8660826938246804
and we must make certain that the details are applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different countries .    2.9753890388738085
i should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon , one or two of which were referred to earlier on .    2.88523864794466
i welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime .    3.0047766649584475
that is an area that european citizens will respond to and will be happy about .    3.2954222188713196
but the commission and council must know that there are many people in this house who have reservations about the eurodac system , for example .    3.6692626081998916
we accept the UNK role of the council in this , but there are reservations and i am sure that the council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail .    3.4258376270712567
mr schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of ' scoreboard ' .    2.272408261228314
anyone who is english or british or follows UNK knows what a scoreboard is .    2.0695389775922224
a scoreboard tells people the score ; it has to be up - to - date and it has to be clear and visible .    2.9316951517344796
i am sure that commissioner vitorino will make certain that is so .    2.5093249845023164
at the end of six months i hope that the music is still playing and that the european people are still listening .    3.644687379989823
mr president , i would like to welcome the president - in - office and his colleague from the justice ministry , mr costa , and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed .    2.095539832177785
amsterdam and tampere have given us much work to do together , as the excellent draft resolution by mrs terrón today shows .    2.71006566378803
i would like to make three brief points .    2.4030392697327434
the first is that we need a mature dialogue between the council and the european parliament .    3.5925200750030726
it is barely six months since amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together ; we have been UNK each other up , we have had a few minor UNK , but we need to work effectively together .    3.275188014968453
let us stop the shadow - UNK . let us drop the elaborate UNK and let us respect the duties that the treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate .    2.104105100401205
involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process .    2.216450407805097
let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area .    2.4016525156496176
my second point is that we need a properly resourced commission .    3.103863662270939
we have established a new directorate - general , yet it has only 70 people all told .    2.50089134929426
there is an agreement to double this number , but i understand that , so far , not a single new person has arrived .    3.0982368641624283
we are setting the commission a massive task , not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard .    2.87308143107821
the council and parliament must work together to provide the resources that the commission needs .    3.595184020740959
finally , on the content of the debate , i welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of its agenda .    3.4102015530253933
all good things come in UNK , especially in our policy area .    3.4020016463556453
now it is freedom , security and justice , and i hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of commissioner vitorino and resist the temptation to UNK security , important as it is , above the equally important needs of freedom and justice .    2.773932278561436
although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice should be mentioned , we must remember that there is still room for progress .    2.908555176548293
the role of the court of justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete .    2.716556188351627
the unilateral decision by belgium to re - establish border controls is a clear illustration of this .    2.434055357658485
the decision to establish a charter of fundamental rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic , including all people , whatever their nationality , or excluding some .    2.52998965048033
the total lack of progress in european citizenship and the political rights of all european residents is to be regretted .    2.9232558978002996
although action plans established by the high - level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future , these plans do nothing to improve human rights , civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned .    2.906431305754744
we know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements .    2.779433075637193
yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of ' non - UNK ' [ no turning back ] .    2.680449011973971
furthermore , it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the council by a procedure without debate and without consulting parliament .    2.4229667567988633
however , the main concern remains .    2.894652402994762
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.799445241956104
mr president , i would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the council as well as the commissioner .    3.2526822228144994
i thank them for their statements to the house .    2.8031049229445406
rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered i would like to deal with one specific topic : the question of drugs and how we tackle the UNK of the drug culture in our societies .    3.052752229219657
i look to the portuguese presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the finnish presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the member states .    2.885247816614672
we already have , on the international side , plans in place to combat drug trafficking , money laundering and so on .    2.7330739903839807
but to bring it down to a more human level : to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs , and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation ; secondly , to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws ; thirdly , to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people ; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of " normalisation " and " harm reduction " and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people .    2.3092860378207707
mr president , i would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which i am entitled to point out , or remind , the representative of the commission that , in belgium , the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence , right to be UNK with their families , etc .    2.6830466141973957
this is a belgian government measure which flies in the face of the schengen treaty .    2.5073024661597203
i lodged a written complaint on the same subject to commissioner vitorino on 23 december .    2.2885708461154217
i would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me , within the foreseeable future , of the steps the commission will take to penalise this violation of the schengen treaty by the belgian state , in accordance with article UNK of the treaty .    3.0539532554942492
mr president , esteemed gentlemen from portugal , especially the council representatives , you face great expectations on our part .    2.309537648161947
i should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment .    2.679886551842393
i refer to eurodac .    2.6953023221276786
you will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the european parliament in december that eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system , as a community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications , in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and , above all , in order to set out clearly which member state was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure .    3.253996535480907
we were of the opinion that eurodac was becoming a reality .    2.2587951616731545
even in tampere , we were of the opinion that eurodac was becoming a reality .    2.5210057095753498
however , the council then took another direction at the very next summit in december and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected , i . e . that the council should continue to be responsible for implementation , that the regulatory committee would be attached to the council and that , where possible , UNK would still be used to exert pressure .    2.9876210167636876
this is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .    3.3128403266948876
my urgent request on behalf of the group is that you do everything to ensure that eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures .    2.7582090053162833
if you tell us today how you wish to proceed , you will be doing us a great service .    2.843619200503416
mr president , ministers , commissioner , the 1999 UNK of decisions was indeed rich , so much so that it became difficult to gather , i . e . to put those decisions into practice .    2.4946051587930906
i refer in particular to the council and to the inertia of the member states in implementing the decisions they had jointly made .    3.311971255888008
however , the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions , such as the decision to begin implementing the treaty of amsterdam , the decision to incorporate the schengen agreement into the community pillar , and the decision of the cologne council to create a charter of fundamental rights and the decision of the extraordinary european council in tampere to bind the member states to common UNK , priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom , security and justice .    2.81947228900232
without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made , we , the european parliament , would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the council to implement these decisions in many areas , as well as its lack of common vision and , in particular , the lack of transparency and cooperation with the european parliament .    3.634816466720272
from what i have said , it must be obvious to you that the european parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer .    3.609765098820657
do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration ?    2.9126192023016175
how do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the community , reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of europe ?    2.5954375530241416
in light of this new international demographic class UNK by experts at the un , is it not about time you abandoned your traditional , conservative views on refugees and immigrants ?    2.286550799729622
i have great expectations for the portuguese presidency .    2.8368282311454567
mr president , i welcome much , indeed most , of what has been said in this debate .    2.5943058637907375
but i want to add a word of caution .    3.317239014665386
we risk having not too few UNK of rights in this community , but too many : national , european union and european convention ; not too few UNK having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the court across the river there , there is the court in luxembourg .    2.434817008942595
there are also courts in UNK , london , lisbon , dublin and edinburgh .    2.4994131962678607
we must make sure that what we do makes clear sense .    2.9615456439478405
we must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights , for that would be the enemy of freedom , justice and security .    2.565586555555325
we need , in short , to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these .    2.624813130850797
but we must look always to subsidiarity .    2.8305747951593334
like everybody in this house , i want freedom , justice and security . i do not want to see these degenerate into over - centralisation , chaos and confusion .    3.0095100282228175
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would very quickly like to make one point . various members raised questions about the portuguese presidency .    2.5818072179142435
the president of parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal , and my colleague , the minister for justice , and i therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week .    3.1456740235137888
thank you , minister .    2.617497405231206
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
mr president , i am grateful for the council ' s oral , and also written , reply .    2.9619215072312333
their efficiency has been truly remarkable .    2.5920636259271976
then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the commission as well .    3.670667341829913
personally , i am pleased with some of the replies , for example , in relation to issues as sensitive as schengen and the europol convention , which we hope will be reviewed , and i am pleased with the words of the minister for justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities .    3.2252241849308394
i also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control .    3.1983188183837545
representatives of the council , within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this parliament .    3.8034900529140216
question time ( council )    2.522032895734509
the next item is question time ( b5 - 0003 / 2000 ) . we will examine questions to the council .    2.2025490688023903
question no 1 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.943432810771332
subject : construction of nuclear plant in earthquake - prone turkey the two recent earthquakes in turkey registering more than 7 on the richter scale raise tremendous doubts about turkey ' s persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at akkuyu , while energy reserves produced by the atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the eu spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes .    1.5068607702803773
turkey ' s nuclear plans b which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of turkey and the surrounding region b prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by turkey ' s political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of canadian origin of the type acquired by india and pakistan .    1.6796948145464832
what steps will the council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the eu but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the eu budget ?    1.93268510157578
mr president , the council wishes to point out that turkey is a signatory to the convention on nuclear safety , the objectives of which should UNK the fears expressed by mr souladakis .    2.651782336792687
the aim of this convention , which came into force on 24 october 1996 , is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation .    2.504214866875921
it further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks , so as to protect individuals , society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the UNK radiation that can be UNK by such installations .    2.7649714426129677
the convention , as you will be aware , also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur .    2.6697104241914595
i would also like to remind members that , as a candidate for membership of the european union , turkey will - and this is a pre - accession condition , which is an important point - sooner or later , as part of its own pre - accession strategy , have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time , and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety .    2.906378880685159
thank you for your answer .    2.505496408488865
however , i would just like to add the following .    2.862899408330772
turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2 % with this unit .    2.21357711842589
nevertheless , rumour has it that it plans to buy UNK reactors of the type acquired by pakistan and india which were used for nuclear weapons .    1.978784998840138
my second point concerns the safety of these plants .    2.674041059675149
in areas of high seismic risk , it is not enough just to have secure , earthquake - proof buildings . speaking as an engineer , i can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances .    2.44572395652393
however , we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation ; it is just not possible .    2.824037050014666
with this in mind , it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes .    2.5026038561798063
in this respect , and because turkey is situated on the periphery of the european union , we should be helping it to become a more secure , peaceful and cooperative country .    2.7995663051046202
that is our role and this is the point of my question .    3.9000572544742824
i recognise the relevance of the arguments that mr souladakis has put forward .    2.6266362814911073
this is , of course , a highly sensitive issue .    2.7683127983219102
furthermore , it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect turkey , in view of that country ' s proximity to the existing territory of the european union . it also affects other states neighbouring the eu with which we maintain relations .    3.352015247829984
we understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them , particularly during the discussions that we will be having with turkey to define that country ' s own pre - accession strategy agenda .    3.2315575139854573
this question will naturally be one of our key concerns , and the european commission will not fail to take this into account .    3.8889107754671834
thank you , mr president and thank you president - in - office of the council .    2.2582421849952725
i am sure the president - in - office of the council is a very nice man and is very kind to his UNK and his children and his UNK .    2.482801906091734
however , forgive me if i am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me .    2.5173872384867564
i do not believe that the statements made within the council and the votes are available to the public immediately .    3.139308335645387
will you please therefore undertake , before the next plenary in february , to write and tell me where i can find this information on behalf of the public , immediately the council has passed legislation , rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list .    2.6415550247502892
will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ?    2.5074642011567954
with regard to what you were saying , it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the council , apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note , does not actually refer to the opacity , shall we say , of the legislative process , but rather almost to an excess of transparency .    3.1110147904202066
however , i would like to say , mr newton dunn , that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable .    3.1749666325655825
we have no problem , mr newton dunn , in repeating this information to you in writing , but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here , because that meets the requirements of the treaty exactly .    3.2935857800495953
we therefore consider that the general secretariat of the council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the council ' s functions as a legislative body .    2.9948397217247935
i did not ask what the council thought of the proposal which the commission has still not tabled .    3.624089337625373
instead , my question concerns the interpretation in principle of article 255 of the treaty of amsterdam .    2.5270393428225786
does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the european union referred to there ?    3.068791497492101
i should like to have an answer to that question .    2.7054290381258745
does the council consider that , on the basis of article 255 of the treaty , national legislation on transparency can be regulated , that is to say legislation not relating to the eu ' s institutions ?    3.1032581769045753
mr sjöstedt , the answer that i gave was the only answer possible .    2.4998233793694333
nevertheless , i would like to say that any interpretation of article 255 of the treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity .    3.0478666957664755
at the moment , there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this article , and unless there is such a proposal , we cannot move forward on this matter .    2.9420564085112444
in any event , article 255 does not , at first sight , allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity .    2.455875653891871
i am , up to a point , concerned about how the council will fight for the principles contained in the treaty of amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision - making process .    2.920519750571356
how is this to be done when , at the same time , the commission ' s proposal - which has been leaked , so the general public is aware of it - says that employees ' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents , reports , drafts etc ?    3.0548568774820257
does not the council ' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision - making process ?    3.4923266898207284
mrs UNK , the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last intergovernmental conference .    3.0067262516610453
i would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the community institutions " UNK " , it also applies between the institutions .    2.815456210673218
by this i mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the community institutions ' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions , and not only as regards the commission ' s relationship with parliament , but also as regards the commission ' s relationship with the council .    4.02774030801213
as a matter of fact , at the last conference , this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions .    2.888858984566875
the european parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next intergovernmental conference .    3.511158276721991
the matter is still open .    2.8464608623518592
genuine transparency of the institutions ' workings and the way they are presented throughout europe is an extremely important issue and one which , in my opinion , needs to be studied again , particularly in the context of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference .    3.3123225150957643
we have no doubts about this and we think that the members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again .    3.0385607426271215
i believe that the commission ' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function , but i think that there is always room for improvement in this matter .    3.6269451391118253
for our part , we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area .    3.1445721593022435
it is a very important question indeed which UNK sjöstedt and others have asked .    2.4999054949578183
we have a principle of transparency in sweden which UNK democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens , decision makers and authorities .    2.60313647779465
we are very anxious indeed that the eu , too , should move in this direction , and this is also stated in the treaty of amsterdam .    3.3310263988453372
one or two years ago , parliament adopted a report by mrs UNK which is extremely important in this context .    3.5652561471320623
the report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the member states .    2.443003451434693
we can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from parliament .    2.8259644762867326
i want to ask the council if it understands this warning , in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the commission .    3.2122620804644177
i listened very carefully to what mr seixas da costa had to say on transparency and the intergovernmental conference .    2.7120167388719776
my concern is , if i have understood mr seixas da costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the igc , whether the portuguese presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the intergovernmental conference .    2.7704970823464548
after all , examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though i know full well the importance of these lobbies .    2.2671732871644723
it should have its own heading in the agenda of the intergovernmental conference , which would mean widening the agenda .    2.986902301088472
mr dimitrakopoulos , transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions .    2.6002276097036425
this intergovernmental conference will , at the outset , concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate , particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic , more transparent and more efficient .    2.8634400604191548
all of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims .    2.343970307890583
it is obvious that transparency will be a permanent UNK on the european agenda and it will , of course , feature on the agenda of this intergovernmental conference .    3.5406611129684507
i can assure you that this is an issue which the portuguese presidency will keep before the member states and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference .    3.411187537249669
we will then see , at ministerial level , how we can follow this up .    2.63999589838311
it should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the treaty of amsterdam , which was approved last may , and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress .    3.553932553995807
the question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency .    3.106211004763656
my feeling is that , in spite of everything , this issue will always have to be on the agenda , because the public is clearly concerned about it , and because it is linked with the need to make the european institutions accountable to the public .    4.097631677980191
as far as we are concerned , they will be .    3.4084024019331656
we shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter .    3.1232315840254876
question no 5 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.062242938744308
subject : proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000 , and the case of anchovies in particular the latest reports from the international council for the UNK of the sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ices zone viii is critical .    2.8748128006910765
have the council of fisheries ministers and the commission assessed the impact of UNK the portuguese quota for ices zones xi and UNK and UNK zone 34 . 1 . 1 to france ( UNK metric tonnes per year overfishing ) on the ices zone viii anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future ?    2.7917918861108
does the council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established tac of 33 000 metric tonnes per year , given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks ?    2.218411890877624
what measures does the council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks , the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ?    2.7404669182472063
mr president , the portuguese presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question , particularly because it UNK an issue which concerns portugal in a positive way , and i shall explain how .    2.9830229266979886
the council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the bay of biscay to which mr ortuondo larrea refers .    2.6726199879594295
nevertheless , at the last fisheries council of 1999 , held on 16 and 17 december , the member states involved in this area of fishing , namely france , spain and portugal , considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a tac reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes , as the commission proposed , was excessively cautious .    2.649484148348231
a compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks , that is the species of fish being affected , and the socio - economic problems caused by fishing limits . this was achieved by fixing the tac at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999 .    2.8176031628209808
it was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species , of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year .    2.907285753504623
as for the southern stocks of anchovy in ices zone ix , the tac was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999 .    2.238292600252374
fishing quota transfers between portugal and france were reduced UNK from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000 , for fishing in french waters .    2.125189134310358
i would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall , over the whole community fishing area .    2.2725546585526213
in accordance with the principle of relative stability , 90 % of stocks of anchovy in the bay of biscay are allocated to spain and only 10 % to france .    2.3628135712741143
without this transfer from portuguese waters , the level of the bay of biscay tac would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to france .    2.7562458197929782
that is why i think that this is quite positive from portugal ' s point of view .    2.8202747264145387
mr president - in - office of the council , i must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all .    2.2482727718549254
i understand that portugal is affected by this .    2.6423166257916617
however , it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80 % of the anchovies , which , until 1995 , were being fished in the portuguese fishing grounds , through an agreement between that member state - portugal - and france , should now be fished in the bay of biscay and that the council of ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the bay of biscay or the UNK sea .    2.6083475552286726
it has been shown , as we have been claiming since 1995 , that this move is appalling , and , if portugal and france wish to reach an agreement , that is fine by us , but these anchovies should be fished in portuguese fishing grounds and not in the bay of biscay .    2.880552900885709
today , scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the bay of biscay is in danger of UNK , and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that bay .    2.90688900079628
i do not know if you are aware , representatives of the council of ministers , of your responsibility over these last few years , and in 2000 as well , for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the UNK UNK .    3.297553162196076
i would like to say , mr ortuondo larrea , that in its judgement of 5 october 1999 , the european court of justice ruled that this transfer , which was approved , was in accordance with the principles laid down in council regulation 37 / 60 / 92 and , specifically , with its article 9 ( 1 ) , which stipulates that member states may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated .    2.8533453074060633
the court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to spain in zone viii had been maintained at 90 % and france ' s at 10 % .    2.210600653748896
apart from this , mr ortuondo larrea , the court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between portugal and france does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and UNK resources in a rational and responsible way , on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones viii and ix neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to spain .    2.3700656365239543
accordingly , mr ortuondo larrea , the council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer , greater account would be taken of france ' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay .    2.3539148185171785
the council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen .    1.9711378907909178
in concrete terms , 3 000 tonnes represent 57 . 5 % of portugal ' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73 . 9 % in 1999 .    2.1304424639234876
these numbers represent , in our opinion and in the opinion of the council , a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80 % laid down in council regulation UNK / 95 .    3.5201949343607137
question no 6 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.9424374559801556
subject : measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of serbs and romanies in kosovo on 2 december 1999 , nato ' s defence ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of kosovo ' s minority communities .    2.44723689037098
in its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against serbs and romanies , parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the serb population and calls on the leaders of the kosovo albanians to fully respect un resolution 1244 .    2.0062505020423878
the resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings , UNK , detentions , intimidation , UNK , looting , destruction of property and the taking - over of houses etc .    2.2127074660103365
in the light of the above , will the council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of kosovo , as requested by parliament ?    3.046912220797445
what other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing ?    2.507132288090218
mr alavanos , i would like to say that i have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised .    2.8653305182448556
we genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in kosovo for ethnic minorities , for both the serb and romany populations , and the incidents of discrimination , harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region .    2.5389432944946555
the council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to UNK such acts .    2.802368146756076
the council once again reiterated the need , in its december conclusions , to fully implement security council resolution 12 / 99 and has consistently supported bernard kouchner ' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and , in particular , to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region ' s multi - ethnic make - up are effectively implemented .    2.4887047017394432
in our contacts with senior political figures amongst the kosovo albanians , we have stressed - and the portuguese prime minister did this very recently - that persecution of the serb population , the romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable .    2.2180423652318937
i think that this is an extremely important point : this sense of conditionality , which underlies the european union ' s position , is being maintained by the council and will continue to be maintained .    3.128587553671786
we have fully supported the efforts of the united nations mission and the international security forces in kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat .    2.4245139029719036
kfor and the UNK police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person ' s ethnic origin .    2.4078875103032393
the council therefore expressed its satisfaction , in its december conclusions , at the substantial contributions announced by the european commission , which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal , together with similar contributions made by member states .    2.839060258310932
nevertheless , mr alavanos , the council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in kosovo does not match the desired amount , in terms of what the various member states have been able to raise , and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground .    3.112515172155628
we shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region ' s multi - ethnic nature .    2.5855506899625453
i would like to thank mr president - in - office of the council .    2.01491409302819
i believe - as i think we all do - that portugal , its former president , mr soares , and its government , maintained a cautious and middle - of - the - road stance during the UNK in the balkans .    2.9197427262260214
however , there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the european union .    2.727878726133562
unfortunately , we have recently witnessed the eradication of serb , romany , turkish , and UNK minorities in kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next .    3.044013498077602
the united nation ' s , and mr kouchner ' s , mission in kosovo ended in failure .    2.693645274216019
this failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was UNK to put an end to ethnic cleansing , we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side .    2.4927378506830093
and so i would like to repeat my question as to whether the council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with mr kouchner , who has a major responsibility for the situation in kosovo today .    3.0815586972420967
mr alavanos , i cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on mr kouchner ' s responsibilities , and i would like to make two very important points here . the structure being implemented in kosovo is under the auspices of the united nations .    2.5827649350422215
it is a structure to which the european union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the european union have contributed in various ways .    3.149733611018252
there is one thing , however , that we cannot deny , and that is that mr kouchner ' s efforts to return kosovo ' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive .    3.1347877637026422
this is undeniable , even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts , for reasons beyond mr kouchner ' s control , have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be .    2.9062871432546893
i have one last point to make , which is about the european union ' s responsibility and , specifically , in this case , about possible action by the council in this matter , and the responsibility of the international community , which has overall responsibility for the situation in kosovo .    4.277422960648799
therefore , the responsibility of the european union has to be seen in a certain context .    3.865585769374309
it is the international community , and specifically the united nations , which should be held responsible for implementing resolution 12 / 99 and , in particular , for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality .    3.4344600345350824
these are questions which we should all be asking , but the forum for putting these questions is the united nations .    2.755603592565974
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , i heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures , in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities .    3.1251700546397294
i think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public .    3.086558521958523
the question which i therefore ask myself is this : has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area , how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence ?    3.0851292381648387
we have endeavoured to provide material help .    2.4482658648454083
what is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here ?    2.336955159440774
mr rübig , as i said , i understand your concerns very well .    3.4425627689188625
i think that , at the moment , particularly in the last few months , there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to mr kouchner , in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently .    3.9681087008728237
i heard mr kouchner speak at the council of europe ministerial meeting on this issue , and i think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed . in other words , he has been given these resources .    3.493974054825901
there are two fundamental questions in particular .    2.5699007122584248
firstly , an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and , in particular , in protecting certain sections of the civilian population . secondly , an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in kosovo to be kept on .    2.541815205177729
the issue which we should all raise , and i did so myself , in a diplomatic way , a while ago , concerns the very substance of security council resolution 12 / 99 .    2.822879734346748
i know that this is an extremely delicate issue , but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented .    2.801916218123231
we advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety .    3.458907491730865
nevertheless , we must look at this resolution , and this is also something that the united nations security council will probably have to do sooner or later . we will have to do so because , as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world , we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process , and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future .    3.3104151972638167
what we have to do , and we in the european union are already doing it , is to guarantee mr kouchner all the necessary resources , and you are right , mr rübig , we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used .    3.7548455048228573
we in the council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the portuguese presidency .    3.7926113026841315
mr seixas da costa , i totally agree with you .    2.714609558645664
the problem is not mr kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working , namely resolution 1244 .    2.499608305572679
having said this , the eu ' s responsibility , which is both yours and ours , is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region .    2.837700014016392
it is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses , accidents and UNK mentioned by mr alavanos .    2.1756178427031565
if so , does it intend to do so within a general UNK of the region , avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro - states , as has tended to happen elsewhere , and reuniting the parties , in this case kosovo and albania ?    3.017381184938319
question no 8 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.9324360202887318
subject : new interreg initiative in point 1 of annex 2 to its draft communication on interreg entitled : promotion of urban , rural and coastal development , the commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross - border strategy .    2.1670239162955185
however , housing is specifically excluded .    2.3778185276076984
given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest , including small UNK , and , given the need , for a variety of reasons , to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas , does not the council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by interreg ?    2.90938532455307
mr president , the council and , i think , the portuguese presidency in particular , are extremely aware of the importance of the problems mr gallagher ' s question raises and i would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to community policies for the development of rural areas .    3.602380396652948
i would like to point out that in may 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth community reference framework for sustainable rural development .    2.2248774361863277
this was , as you know , one of the changes made during the agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at community level .    2.8759394490128214
through the european agricultural guarantee and guidance fund , the eaggf , this community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of UNK rural areas , an issue you are quite right to raise .    2.4726582112012774
on the other hand , the european regional development fund , the erdf , also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion , by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion .    2.6054320864862586
in this regard , we should bear in mind that the erdf also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas .    2.601348517064898
we think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy , and the eaggf , of course , has a crucial role to play in this .    3.5387990593269554
question no 9 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.9400007313091225
subject : farming and the portuguese presidency will the council outline the priorities of the portuguese presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health UNK ?    2.7193942829777096
your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this house ' s discussions , because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length .    3.1955059476879963
during the portuguese presidency , we will be continuing discussions on the cap , by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the union ' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers ' incomes , paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family - run farms .    2.850776516231447
on the other hand , the portuguese presidency will continue , if and when the new wto round begins within its term of office , which is by no means guaranteed , to ensure that the presence of community production on international markets is strengthened . it will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported community farm products and preserving the multifunctional european agriculture to which i have just referred .    2.621318817193945
the portuguese presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and i think that the portuguese foreign minister and president - in - office already referred to this aspect this morning .    2.6868429922616026
we shall be developing it in four parallel schemes , in the agriculture council , the health council , the consumer affairs council and the internal market council .    3.4227170569688403
at the UNK maria da feira european council meeting in june , the portuguese presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the commission presented in its white paper a few days ago .    2.951102241464951
we think that the task we now have of establishing a european agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market , to stabilise confidence in this market , to break down some of the tensions between member states in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the european union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety .    3.2229865069508654
this is what we shall be trying to achieve during the portuguese presidency and we hope , at the end of it , to be able to present the result of our efforts to this house .    3.9024414570869235
i am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the european model which is based on family farming , mainly those farmers involved in beef and UNK production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs .    2.6479328005611964
i would like to ask what new steps the council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks , in particular , against the UNK and factory - style production of the usa and new zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for european farmers extremely difficult and where , of course , european standards of food safety do not apply .    2.4963899704172996
i completely understand your concerns , and i feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the european union itself on this issue .    3.445263413290927
we also have to think of the consequences , especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers .    3.2507946949468507
nevertheless , as you know , this issue is now in the hands of the european commission and it will have to take this further .    4.684790191141988
the council ' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited .    3.2022040962008123
mr president , i too would like to welcome the president - in - office to the chamber .    2.3964778120050143
but i do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the portuguese presidency would be willing to meet the non - governmental organisations actively involved in this field .    2.697980276780599
i appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi - disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency .    2.783066984796979
my specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the president - in - office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level .    2.8950665723544757
mr crowley , with regard to the presidency ' s scope for supporting actions by non - governmental organisations , particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless , i would like to say that such initiatives are welcome , and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them .    2.974632641821539
we have worked closely with portuguese ngos and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the portuguese presidency , which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme .    2.5019487311089823
we have no specific , concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by ngos in this area might be considered during our presidency .    2.959243370107952
it should be pointed out that this can only be done within the council ' s scope for action .    3.234813032955978
any aspect of this which may UNK on the commission ' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the commission itself .    3.693147823459908
mr president - in - office of the council , you have talked a lot about the future , about what the commission will do , and what the presidency will do in lisbon , etc . however , you also said something which i find particularly UNK .    3.103385608834922
you said that in lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development .    2.7058388247102916
i am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead , partially at least , to exclusion .    2.3111490344258545
i do not see how you could , with the views that you hold , provide any answers .    2.582346908722144
what i asked and what i am once again asking is the following : what are the views of the portuguese presidency on , for example , the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion , the division of work and social security , the implementation of tax policies , particularly for speculative capital , and the policy of redistributing wealth ?    3.2192275312896923
you must understand that a presidency ' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited .    2.2045701780549556
i think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the commission ' s own scope for intervening , through its right of initiative .    3.149485770353261
i have spoken about the special european council and about portugal ' s initiative in convening it , and i have spoken about the future , because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion .    3.2920845494624853
the portuguese presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can , in six months , resolve problems that have always existed .    2.8012706189856997
it is prepared to act on proposals by the commission in any area for which there is community competence .    3.1978987939289043
it also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented , specifically by non - governmental organisations , but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters .    2.825017684111715
we should , however , also bear in mind , mr papayannakis , that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact , armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months .    2.8566774521389924
we therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long - term strategies , regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term , some of the homeless may be dead , will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the european union .    3.3924910312717507
we will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency .    2.359331000648744
question no 12 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.067307714672779
subject : portuguese presidency and development policy will the president - in - office of the council make a statement on the priorities of the portuguese presidency with regard to development policy , the convention of lomé and tackling famine situations ?    2.9381169572544694
i would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question , and indeed the minister who spoke to the committee on development last week in brussels outlining the position .    2.6571787544933403
there does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against aids in the programme .    3.2441683381382562
the situation of aids in africa now is so serious that more people are dying of aids than are dying in conflict .    2.3340325521522582
i hope that the minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue .    2.3722363716788446
medicines are available in the united states but the united states is not making them cheap enough for the people in africa .    3.3629666398016194
i should like to ask the minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in ethiopia where there is drought , where the crops have failed , and where , in six months ' time , we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands .    2.6681677671774855
at the same time , there is a war going on between eritrea and ethiopia and the UNK industry in europe is not short in sending UNK , after which we will send the bread .    2.8645495610077565
first of all , mr UNK , you must understand that i do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague ' s speech during the meeting of the committee on development . there is no contradiction between our two positions , quite the opposite .    3.23476010544919
unless we wish to act like UNK , we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face , particularly in the area of external relations .    2.739611096032979
as you can understand , it would be easy to do so .    3.067624582638244
all we would have to do is get a UNK of development and put all the items in our programme , one after the other .    3.0633898519557516
we are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments ' ability to act and within the scope of the council .    2.9404616833786013
we must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve , particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes .    3.546127920154426
you have mentioned ethiopia , which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes , but there are , as you know , several community actions to combat aids , and in this respect , you are right , and the united states will probably not do any better .    3.4374587470715405
indeed , in terms of development aid policy , i think that europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area UNK very favourably with that of the united states .    3.0603376717220203
your question UNK to the subject of arms , a broader policy issue which i do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the council will , of course , address in the future , if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context .    3.331811072388068
is the council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the eu to developing countries at prices below the cost of production ?    3.2634004104221397
does the presidency intend to do anything about this ?    3.0822212028197344
since the author is not present , question no 13 lapses .    2.3025832935362205
i would like to thank the president - in - office of the council , and i would personally like to welcome him and the portuguese presidency .    2.5447061502249015
please allow me to remark on how well - versed and well - informed he is on european affairs .    2.3878799160589868
unfortunately , in my case , he did not provide what i would call a satisfactory answer .    3.014753453597288
since the council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset , it should , in my view , demonstrate this in practice .    3.2168058833499966
my question , which has not been answered , is why , when the european parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the european union , the council and the commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether .    3.257458135108228
this is a true example of the council ' s indifference towards culture , despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance .    3.2362980617652934
i would therefore like to ask the council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same UNK as it supported UNK , UNK , cows and indian UNK .    2.761240053943674
mr marinos , we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the portuguese presidency , and therefore , the cultural dimension is , i am sure you will appreciate , one of our main concerns .    3.472366725709585
these cultural dimensions , however , almost always have their own economic dimension in turn , that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives .    3.1642793711212387
this is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the european union , and especially within the framework of the council .    3.3589575084976926
for our part , we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the european position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere , because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the union ' s image and to the union ' s own particular identity .    3.0400643320583516
this is , and will continue to be , connected with developments within the world trade organisation .    2.8455827953763535
as you know , both we and the council have addressed this issue appropriately .    2.7020136076822863
in specific terms , we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the commission for the next round of wto negotiations , at which this will be a central issue .    4.04371063669958
nevertheless , i would like to add that with regard to cultural policy , and in particular the audiovisual dimension , the portuguese presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching european audiovisual policy by adopting a media - plus programme which could go some way towards UNK europe ' s main fears .    2.537523063475117
the presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in europe , which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the portuguese presidency , in conjunction with the commission , in february 2000 .    3.326265502665121
but , mr marinos , in the eu context , culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with igc agendas .    3.1683526354004083
if , by chance , it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , then this could be suggested , both by member states , and by the members of the european parliament taking part in the preparatory group .    3.1896404664916416
of course , if consensus could be reached on this issue at the intergovernmental conference , there might eventually be progress .    2.8184482339064183
it remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this .    3.307130326294518
we will soon see , and for our part , we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue .    3.3008996213701756
mr president , i join others in wishing portugal every good wish for a successful presidency .    1.9950504449041355
i notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next igc but if some people wished it , you would consider it .    2.480080925794609
well , i , and my fellow 35 british conservative meps wish it and would like you to please consider it .    2.393474040983439
i appreciate that it is a provocative question .    3.6645525501580276
we have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can UNK with our citizens .    2.5030831260101785
i cannot think of a better way to do it .    2.961072521384087
can you ?    3.1163255614496874
the issue is whether the european dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the treaties .    2.6294883654405456
this is an issue which , as you will understand , will have to be addressed at igc level and is an issue that only a special european council can authorise the portuguese presidency to pursue , because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming intergovernmental conference will take place .    3.3149704920149645
intergovernmental conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of christmas tree .    2.6958273123999796
it is therefore not out of the question that these issues , which crop up again and again , and which are passed from one conference to another , may be addressed .    2.8020398369772437
the problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the european union on this issue being included , particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included , other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference ' s agenda .    2.725885392339854
mr dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion .    2.47823501899057
i would ask him to be brief .    2.7767775812873556
mr president , i understand that i have to do this very quickly .    4.103123164928374
i liked what mr seixas da costa said about father christmas .    2.3290195160664684
in spain they say a letter to the three kings .    2.398735446651262
i simply wish to remind you that the european parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports .    2.7802495534682374
now the presidency and the council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings .    3.0025213605853662
we thank mr seixas da costa , but he can also write his letter to the three kings .    2.2618134139943296
i would merely say that the festive issue which mr dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one .    2.6148890792913684
the problem is that in this case father christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so .    2.3823469394601897
it is not the portuguese presidency ' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants , especially those that the european parliament is asking for .    2.9237504111847223
after this interesting exchange of opinions , and in accordance with the rules of procedure , i would like to tell you that questions nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing .    2.5897766679979397
that concludes questions to the council .    2.623209247024021
capital tax    3.887800883370909
the next item is the joint debate on :    2.0397628948456488
the oral question ( b5 - 0004 / 2000 ) by mr désir and others , to the council , on the council position on the idea of a capital tax    3.8241904708490098
the oral question ( b5 - UNK / 2000 ) by mr désir and others , to the commission , on the commission position on the idea of a capital tax .    3.4666020036087275
madam president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , during the asian crisis in 1997 , as with those which hit mexico in 1995 or the UNK in 1993 , everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation , particularly currency speculation .    2.2239285438998473
between eur 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets . in three or four days , this can equal the total figure of annual global production , or global gdp , of approximately eur 6 000 billion .    2.02701412408834
the bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments .    2.309262212880954
yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can , in a few hours , cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country , UNK its whole population into recession .    2.7571100521976732
in view of this situation , renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by UNK tobin , winner of the nobel prize for economics , to create a tax on currency transactions . the rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments , but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation , thereby checking the multiplication of short - term transactions .    2.6580412828369373
one reason for the acceptance of this proposal , and of the campaigns by ngos such as attac , UNK or others which have UNK this proposal , is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries , in areas such as education or health .    3.102179966084862
it could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty .    2.688059700327628
many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the UNK president , fernando UNK , the finnish government , the canadian parliament last march and also UNK jospin in 1995 .    2.649760280685754
this question has been debated in several national parliaments of the eu .    2.625422776862089
the common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the european union . this is the reason for the oral question to the council and commission which we have tabled with 37 other members .    3.6619733377063985
i am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the gue / ngl , greens / efa , eldr and pse groups .    2.5103127360858535
this motion asks the commission to present a report to parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax . it also asks for an examination of the pressures and financial sanctions which could be applied against countries which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax havens .    2.322371212560696
one of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex , but this could be said of any tax . if this argument had been accepted in the past , then no taxes would ever have been created .    2.7296941484536696
the motion also asks that a position document , drawn up by the commission and council , should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the imf .    2.941128222157506
the european union must take the initiative and must also , as demanded in the motion , propose this initiative to the g7 because it is primarily a political question .    2.9808045888213637
if the union takes the initiative , this will have a UNK effect because this debate is occurring all over the world , including in the usa and japan . a desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people , their parliaments , their governments and their democratic institutions .    2.7801734592860456
europe must play a role in this new international regulation and i am extremely happy that today , with this debate and this motion , this question is now on the agenda of european construction .    3.3082245542203523
madam president , i do not have a great deal to add on this subject .    3.1814404798321307
the council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as professor tobin suggested .    2.5756223246239656
this is a creative initiative , which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in european politics , but the commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue .    2.824933045040964
as it falls to the commission to propose any such initiative , the council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue .    4.1828139996298965
madam president , the revenue basis of the tobin tax is said to be made up of very short - term exchange transactions .    3.349300097554114
such transactions , according to the argument , bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables . this has also just been underlined by mr désir .    2.515297181395549
therefore , according to proponents , such as mr désir , an internationally applied tobin tax would , in principle , reduce speculative transactions and , hence , the volatility of exchange rates , which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity .    2.7019382641140637
taking into account the considerable volume of short - term financial streams , even a low nominal tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue .    2.33721522109253
in reality , the motive underlying the increased interest in the tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid - nineties was non - economic .    2.419477754805175
indeed , it was UNK by the potential of this tax to generate income for international , public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by .    2.3939132534195804
the commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax , such as the tobin tax , as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation , so to speak .    2.865763014211214
mr désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides .    2.32339394779121
but if the tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency , then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market .    2.9905950396152443
put more strongly , in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds , the tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off - UNK tax havens .    2.594003603934796
in that case , the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity .    2.8653780222437573
so the tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate .    3.4616591831244214
finally , even if the tobin tax is designed to curb UNK with currencies , there is still the risk that even non - speculative streams would be affected , and that is not the intention .    3.2438800849664076
for the reasons set out above , i cannot see a good reason for introducing a european tobin tax .    2.6485391571345773
at any rate , the commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the european union .    3.004297079264149
in more direct terms , to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams , this would contravene the treaty of rome .    2.4910763885624743
the correct speculative approach , it seems to me , is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos , rather than attempting to UNK its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets .    2.598910017822041
madam president , commissioner , i should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question .    2.354667703671887
also because i know how many social democrats in this house share our criticism , and not just the economic and financial policy experts .    3.1999295237208254
we know what the problem is : instability on the markets as the result of speculation .    2.736550975242898
but the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability , as the commissioner has just so impressively told us , is the result of speculation .    2.892063910312468
the tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the UNK in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south - east asian currencies in 1997 .    3.2754636528949987
the UNK of this question do not propose a solution ; instead they are calling for a new burden , they are calling for more bureaucracy , for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary ' s time with an intergroup opinion which UNK the competent parliamentary committee , contrary to several resolutions by parliament .    2.568831246620648
in my view , and i say this quite clearly , the question is UNK motivated rather than solution - focused .    3.1341574428842374
i consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons .    2.6333632151561432
why do we reject the tobin tax and consider it so questionable ?    2.694049955795773
first , and the commissioner has also confirmed this , because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets .    3.2868423606274
even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets , because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably .    2.3686275076917416
in addition , this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital , which is one of the central tenets of the internal market .    3.2144277459226958
secondly , speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify .    2.526920418801419
thirdly , unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time , tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes .    2.4757126892715426
fourthly , technically speaking , this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control .    2.4776954917211342
the measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today .    3.8878460931879784
we need stronger banking supervision .    2.4534654120917363
we need to clarify the liability for transactions .    2.7577465584149454
we need a framework of regulations at international level .    2.9141435067859955
we need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up .    2.6128595976576827
i have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands .    3.1966554180491484
i refer to point 9 .    2.750491815528868
having listened to the commissioner just now , we know that the commission ' s knowledge of the facts will result in a ' no ' to the tobin tax .    3.272064431813658
if the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say , and i think that they are right , then to take up another six months of the commission ' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible .    3.3583875429823196
the capital markets do not want uncertainty from us , they want clarity ; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote .    2.6814720649022945
madam president , the debate on a tax on short - term financial actions is not a new one .    3.229600093948953
we have been discussing the tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies .    2.3601280401103932
we need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short - term transactions really is .    2.3528583220847317
we are concerned about stability on the financial markets , not for the sake of the financial markets , but because this has to do with own growth , our own investments and our own jobs in the european union .    3.1413471113690985
we must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past .    2.9885376847880587
we have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions , but so far we have had no working set of rules , as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the asian and latin american crises .    2.3949032004498876
it is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information .    2.305933586119099
it is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is .    2.354931622278568
we must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice .    3.6159857240071887
at a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout europe and internationally , we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short - term financial transactions .    3.042706871026972
i think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the commission , so that we as the european parliament can see if we need to ensure that the european union achieves real international solidarity with the usa and japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure .    3.6029696236984017
this is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward - looking proposal .    2.5399579758848465
madam president , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , i must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which , although it does not mention it in the text , appears to be an attempt to revive , as the introduction has done , the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by mr tobin , which our group opposed , clearly and totally , during the last legislature , with a series of arguments clearly and UNK expressed by our president , mr cox .    2.8094060717746556
i will have to repeat these arguments , UNK , in this intervention , because the same issue has arisen once again .    3.5172333105732045
we do not agree with this type of tax because its application , in the event that it could happen , would not achieve the aims which mr tobin presented at the time and which the left in this house wishes to revive .    3.0638558916876697
firstly , there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets .    2.5425500678243407
on the contrary , since it is certain that not all countries would accept it , we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility , instability , insecurity , opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level .    2.396753988162297
furthermore , the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appears simply impossible .    2.7765327087705467
this is a false debate whose aim is purely political , and has no basis or technical viability .    2.26906323531176
furthermore - since we are in this european parliament - if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the commission within the european union , how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level ?    3.4479612825049157
i suppose that the first thing they say will be , ' let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the union ' .    2.9814110311640256
however , the liberal group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and , therefore , we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and UNK of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements .    3.012592868262929
i am sure that this study - if carried out objectively , with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible , not only in terms of its application , but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives .    2.861445436950668
in itself , globalisation is positive .    3.3151684025647983
the economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level .    2.154562479258147
this is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital .    2.3513923697539494
any analysis of economic development in recent years , if objective , will show , through the figures , that they have no political UNK or orientation .    2.8960286073641894
as i have said , we are not opposed to such a study .    3.420530584828005
we will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study , but we simply insist that , as this motion for a resolution points out , it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress , both on the level of states and on a general level .    3.426395001381992
madam president , commissioner , the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature .    2.562024861980703
as mrs randzio - plath said , we must remember that the reason why certain members want to revive this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic , social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries .    2.9360277318258348
the main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system .    3.5847016937467404
in this respect , mr bolkestein , the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the tobin tax .    2.776573748588501
if you look carefully , this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets .    2.038823527309531
secondly , the motion does not say that we want a solely european initiative .    2.9962669274552773
this is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the international monetary fund so that the european union , in other words the commission and also the council , can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation .    3.3488889717027948
there should be no confusion in this debate . as environmentalists , we do not want an excuse for a motion .    2.8231724114766426
although a study produced by the commission would doubtless be interesting , we do not need another to add to those already available .    3.2027461369785497
we do need to obtain , from the commission and the council , in other words from each of the governments forming the union , a clear , positive or negative , political stance . they must indicate whether they are ready to defend , within competent public bodies such as the international monetary fund in the first instance , the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system .    3.1348621668904153
as for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty , very short - term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short - term financial assets .    2.1369496091360705
this argument is therefore not relevant .    2.8901580227343526
i will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments .    2.3038331181917853
however , i would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion , but also paragraph 10 .    2.9315559338362993
we clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the international monetary fund . we therefore demand , if this motion is adopted tomorrow , that the commission and council appear before parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion .    2.7629904993790944
madam president , my group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today , particularly as we have spared no effort along with members of other groups to bring this about .    2.612014095691009
obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning .    2.690258818752583
having said this , our group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents . this invites the commission to present a report within six months .    2.6733150218490946
the european parliament can play its role by taking the initiative , even if it does so UNK , on this subject . however , i agree with the previous speaker that , if paragraph 9 were challenged , this motion would clearly lose its substance .    3.0136009910576425
this debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising . what are the respective places of people and finance in today ' s economy ?    2.533390435260243
usd 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world ' s currency markets . this represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services .    2.4305666400306696
it has led to a growth in mergers , acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets .    2.1116479731124116
unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing .    2.5251598021113377
openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries , to the point of collapse , as in asia , russia and brazil .    2.421404180448221
faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets , demand , as our motion recognises , is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world .    2.392138982037856
no one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information .    2.963034527196205
in this respect , all ideas deserve to be considered , including the tobin tax which is important , just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged .    2.9096655228044
this tax could help to check speculation without UNK the activities of the real economy . it could release new resources for investment in people and , at a time when the UNK estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be usd 40 billion per year , it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs .    2.277502760538044
when the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global , the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators .    2.7924924195525
the commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this .    2.6014538226831134
i would point out that the european union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and , like mr désir and several other speakers , i feel that the european union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect .    3.5043670826758824
in any case , the european parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well - being for everyone .    3.3666387124547015
madam president , i too am delighted that we are having this debate . i only regret that it has been so long in coming .    3.293258469521981
with a figure for trade in goods and services of UNK 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days ' speculation , the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals .    2.1733991245659925
it is self - perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man , the rich as much as the poor . yet it is the latter who , at the end of the day , are excluded from the majority of the world ' s decision - making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently , and very aptly , by jean - pierre chevènement as the globalised élites .    2.4112562418093693
it was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre , thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both UNK and irresponsible .    1.9292583388291837
however , the people are fighting back , as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible seattle summit . the leaders of the world , headed unfortunately by the european commission , UNK forward UNK , hoping that their UNK at the feet of the master of the world , mr clinton , would be enough to ensure them the UNK from the table .    2.6730079752076685
yet they UNK without the salutary reaction of the UNK , both individuals and states . this reaction was more organised than previously , due in france particularly to the magnificent attac network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular .    2.1910871283240874
the creation of this taxation , of either the tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by professor UNK , could prove to be politically opportune , at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate . this is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a UNK in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of states .    2.300069278727322
madam president , although some of the aims of the tobin tax are fairly worthy of support , introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the european union , as the first area of the world to do so , would sound the death knell for the european currency markets .    3.351916044058057
if the world ' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the tobin tax , the fact that tax was liable to be paid in europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas .    2.8587014855430795
this has already been made clear a number times in this debate .    2.8312734603255443
it is not enough that all the world ' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme , as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries .    2.486790676863098
there should therefore be a universal application : it is not enough that the g7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved .    2.803151639912439
on the other hand , it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking , i do not believe we can achieve this - that the tobin tax dream might as well be buried .    3.0232061491652673
furthermore , although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme , the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed .    2.514466279594201
the world ' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used , for example , for a variety of well - meaning , un - backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them .    2.4903423196468397
with regard to the tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises , it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be UNK through taxation .    2.721508074274362
for that reason , as mr karas also said , we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value .    3.2269263709218077
this again would require measures to regulate the UNK and UNK of capital ; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way .    3.3114435774335136
although it seems a reasonable scheme , the tobin tax is not without its problems , even if there should be agreement as to its implementation , which i do not believe there will .    3.1607397055778472
for that reason , the UNK flow of assets in massive UNK between the world ' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity , which has nothing to do with the real economy .    2.9305902971495352
if this ' UNK ' mechanism , which gives users the opportunity to make choices , were hampered by measures such as the tobin tax , mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it .    2.789303989658937
hence , as mr karas has stated to his credit , our group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the tobin tax .    2.768966878515822
madam president , i speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders .    2.6127502065822354
it seems to me UNK self - evident that some action is necessary .    2.452383944372996
in the last 30 years , the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times : firstly , total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading ; secondly , annual global trade in real goods and services UNK just three - and - a - half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350 , that is , 1 % of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99 % are for speculation .    2.172619298917605
the size , UNK and UNK of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies .    2.976236624807147
computer - controlled selling programmes turned a random UNK into an avalanche , UNK jobs , lives and industries across the globe .    1.9204452382508173
the only arguments against it are : firstly , it would UNK the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little UNK in light of the financial feeding UNK we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world , in east asia , europe and latin america .    2.7979472042848728
mr UNK has described those who engage in this as the aids virus of the world economy .    2.735544939313664
what is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators , UNK and option traders .    2.4495525211174503
of course , this cannot be done in one country ; it cannot be done within the single currency area , but it could be done at international level with global cooperation .    3.3731433079664437
europe , japan and the us - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block .    2.4956735092025806
i am disappointed in the epp .    2.689249972366268
i thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on .    2.604503025119394
yes , i am in favour of such a tax , but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow .    4.317955322540342
what we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the commission to study the matter , to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax .    3.3789745458535334
equally i understand the commissioner failing to endorse such a tax , but i cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue .    3.035717436579789
there is nothing so closed as a closed mind .    2.332770728970391
the tax has the support of 47 % of the people in the uk , according to a recent survey by war on want .    3.3451885451106156
in france it has had enormous UNK , particularly when linked to a demand to use the UNK to help the third world out of its debt and poverty .    2.935856976294614
this issue can no longer be ignored by parliament , the council or the commission .    3.576694670307746
there is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than : " it has not been done before " .    2.5305781005580057
in the new millennium , with new global problems requiring new global solutions , they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now , rather than why it has not been done in the past .    2.9793928254046085
madam president , commissioner , a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules .    2.516187524328433
i have two or three points to make in this respect .    2.833977711667148
one of the main demands of the demonstrators in seattle was , rightly , the establishment of this type of tax , and this is not by chance .    3.3638473997827156
the proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich european countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of UNK .    2.5699901257201834
everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects . the members on the right should note this .    2.2128228041459037
it UNK the need for solidarity with the countries of the south , particularly those in africa , the caribbean and the pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in seattle .    2.898056874040605
madam president , we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted ; we must also mention the fact , commissioner , that 80 % of these huge , daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days .    2.5940939156422904
we cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short - term sales of foreign currency and shares .    2.2013361765219366
we cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action .    2.654789693935436
we cannot maintain a situation in which income from non - economic activities increases more and more quickly .    2.2977379251078194
it has been demonstrated in germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7 . 6 % of overall economic income since tobin developed his idea .    1.9010432926569094
we cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short - term currency fluctuations .    2.765913058267397
nor do i believe that this is impracticable .    3.529467085117141
why should it not be possible for the g7 countries , the other eu member states , china , UNK and switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the tobin tax ?    3.684340204401078
there must be an overriding economic interest .    2.5956804491105983
why should it be impracticable , and it can be differentiated , to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions , all the so - called cash transactions , currency futures and options ?    2.483519613792385
why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long - term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short - term and speculative investments UNK .    2.3000249872529626
numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise , but the only real problem which i can see so far is one of political will and the st . UNK principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold .    2.396253593053101
madam president , we are not asking for more bureaucracy , as mr karas put it just a few minutes ago .    3.1325317937684094
we are looking for solutions .    2.864251668783647
of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea .    2.456890889446589
the tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question .    2.724540729661954
" the more progress is made towards trade liberalisation , the more rules are needed " , as commissioner UNK said during the millennium round in seattle .    2.2818234407070994
he recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the european union ' s construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations .    2.9839888368766316
now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary , all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions .    2.1895674777412975
we citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation .    3.1141147361910715
to continue would be economic UNK .    2.596747688225607
honourable members , commissioner , it is often said that europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector , but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector .    3.187034048481864
if we look at the private sector , however , we will find not only that this UNK ' financial stability ' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a UNK ready to UNK at any moment .    3.1676338912864077
the debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of stock exchange securities , the two main market stability indicators , have , for some time , been at danger levels , as the commission report on the economic situation in europe clearly illustrates .    2.633982926827378
the fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains .    2.2288633606091746
speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are , in turn , generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely UNK .    2.431685514758153
over - optimism will give way to disappointment and fear , which , in turn , will result in a stock market and economic crisis .    2.4831967109423148
the danger is too great for us to ignore .    2.9159937692028506
modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the tobin proposal and others , which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start .    3.33051841497533
that is what we are lacking , commissioner : the political will to make a start in tackling speculation .    2.793784929655954
no longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of , or for this UNK approach towards , market forces as adopted by the liberals - and i am sorry that mr gasòliba i böhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin .    2.397230065141868
madam president , mr bolkestein , the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable .    2.6360950227039
we needed a greek member to finally tell us what this tobin tax means .    2.1327542297454745
that the right opposes taxes is quite understandable , except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions , or rather billions , into switzerland .    2.2741404519525035
we all know that !    2.817505720258013
but now i call on you , in all consciousness , to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long - term projects with long - term capital .    2.84869844316692
it has never been done in south - east asia , it has never been done in europe , and i can understand why mr karas from austria has left the chamber , given austria ' s financial record .    3.2050635042159854
they are all UNK with the same dirty brush !    3.50956845599252
we need a tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene .    2.9973652724423827
madam president , i am totally UNK by the commission ' s , i . e . mr bolkestein ' s , political ignorance !    3.423836884669335
madam president , i too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre .    2.8968951505279876
it is perhaps not by chance that the conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western europe over recent decades .    2.0819876290446726
if we continue down this path , and this is the ideology , and declare the financial markets to be UNK and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy , then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions .    2.7131436727980183
those who own the monetary assets are currently UNK huge UNK which are again UNK out to be UNK .    2.4183418240359322
we have asset inflation of global proportions .    2.3247494918698255
as a result , speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets , causing growing economic instability which , in turn , jeopardises the entire economy .    2.296337812766139
and it is precisely the medium - sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result .    2.9743110002489908
we can take action against this ; it is possible .    3.350443754085041
the minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last , not only by the commission , but by reputable economic UNK throughout europe .    3.1725695863331667
that too is feasible .    2.714476437871016
and then perhaps everyone will stop UNK about arguments which are asking for trouble !    2.2889097403357024
it is not correct that the tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer .    2.737464959104053
the fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard UNK storage space for large european banks here at home must not be ignored .    2.2413453244994
madam president , let us indeed tax money speculation : it does not produce anything new .    2.5632951429854174
the tax would be targeted at the right place : at the speculators .    2.472440781283638
who is going to defend these speculators , when UNK and teachers are paying top rates of tax ?    2.2931161422741826
article 73 c of the treaty establishing the european union provides scope for taxation on transactions .    3.170283888563522
those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax - recycling centres , the tax havens , of which there are 62 in all .    2.547145785317754
the union should make a tax pact , which any countries could initially be party to .    2.2444366007169227
the low rate tobin tax would not cause tax - recycling problems .    2.388818652244243
it is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect .    2.6844146501850403
the european union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries , and you see how we are today .    3.3434646458217174
the truth is the greatest problem is a political one : they do not want to tax capital , but raise personal taxation instead .    2.5428462425649334
in the end tax would UNK the global , undemocratic system of financial power .    2.559492044780691
ladies and gentlemen , we must challenge the monopoly the world ' s speculative UNK have on planning the world ' s economy by remaining outside the tax system .    2.5963127549640763
madam president , may i begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and , above all of course , mr désir , for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening .    3.3063501494511094
whatever one may think about the topic of debate , it is evident that it is an important one .    3.6275338994975077
this is why it has been around for years , and it is satisfying that the commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response .    3.2983478846266867
i would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the member of your parliament , mr gasòliba .    2.734998993776115
he said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon , and i share his view .    3.169331703252585
i believe that globalisation has helped many countries which , so far , have been on the UNK of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and , as far as i am aware , no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade .    2.924734157041155
in other words , as indeed already remarked by mr gasòliba , globalisation is , in my view , positive , and i am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years .    2.9728429978694635
a second remark made by mr gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates .    2.805192005236722
i too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates .    2.6082282468978955
i am of the opinion that these are two important remarks , and that is why i am reiterating them here .    3.030102321561695
madam president , could i furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the european union on the other ?    3.149693958368754
surely we are all familiar with the treaty of rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement .    3.172872414224923
madam president , i can assure your parliament that my day - to - day work consists partly of attempting , in conjunction with my offices and colleagues , to completely integrate the financial markets within europe , thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible .    2.1404237918633084
in my capacity as commissioner for the internal market , i am , in other words , opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions .    3.0640452791590107
you could hardly expect this commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact , impede international economic movement .    2.5709347057707075
once again , the tobin tax is , in my view , at odds with the treaty of rome , and this is an important , theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening .    3.287061306986501
madam president , apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations , there are also practical objections to the tobin tax , as already underlined by mr karas and other speakers .    2.717493862530432
it has unfortunately been observed , i have to say , that the european union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures . this indicates how difficult these dossiers are .    2.963136031984043
if we have not been able to reach agreement internally , i wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners .    3.270326384789014
i think that this will be problematic .    2.90275242456335
madam president , mr jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets .    3.102132521446359
i think , however , that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes . i think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when , as already stated , the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the treaty of rome .    2.7482368910819046
in order to remove these causes , one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question .    3.0726272114289084
is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in english ' good governance ' ?    2.33022124425661
is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates ?    2.9747676821156595
that the markets for production factors , including the labour market , operate flexibly ?    2.827473529239792
that is not always the case .    2.7795206067390335
so if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability , then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first .    3.299829150911809
in addition - and this has also been mentioned already , for example by mr gasòliba i böhm , but also by others - there is a need for more supervision .    3.2118567750062192
more supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally , for example by means of the imf .    2.7581573679205578
so i believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring , on the one hand , that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that , on the other hand , there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses .    3.444161657459766
madam president , according to various members of your parliament , more funding should still be made available for major projects .    2.5463690117913154
for example , mr UNK - UNK spoke in english about ' long - term capital for long - term projects ' - this is an obvious issue .    3.1337937956291158
my reply to this is that , firstly , countries should honour their pledges , namely make 0 . 7 % of their gross national product available for development aid and cooperation , so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long - term projects and via a route established for the purpose , namely contributions to development cooperation , and not via an artificial and probably harmful route , namely the tobin tax .    2.539875048474043
madam president , i should like to leave it here . as far as the resolution is concerned , of which i have seen a draft , the commission will await the vote and will , based on this , determine its stance .    3.418856199790612
i thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate .    2.9994777712442824
i have received four motions for a resolution , tabled pursuant to rule 40 ( 5 ) of the rules of procedure .    2.4178023321679505
but i would be obliged if mr bolkestein would just listen for a minute , which i think he cannot do at the same time as talking to mrs randzio - plath .    2.6245734616961927
could you please draw his attention to the fact that i have something to say to him ?    3.395942261729542
UNK bolkestein , UNK UNK UNK dire UNK chose !    3.03441741936094
unfortunately , my dutch is not as good as yours .    2.6509934792493155
but i would rather like to say something else to you .    3.1036154812316066
parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a tobin type tax just to UNK the commission .    3.024179197326303
we want to examine the possibility of introducing a tobin tax .    3.119862678199243
it will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this .    2.7479418667572446
from a political point of view , i always UNK when people say , we neither need , want nor can we achieve these things !    2.3760534775950917
it is not your job , it is our job to decide on that .    3.1030155391498235
it also has something to do with the newly awoken self - consciousness of this parliament .    2.5562718169855607
i just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less .    2.5631509189336916
we can do so without going off at other UNK . i respect you as a serious commissioner who wants to take his work seriously .    2.2090154112773206
please respect us as members of parliament who want to take our work seriously , and that includes the tobin tax !    3.525946303266513
madam president , an omission appears to have been made . in the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out , no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the pse , eldr , gue / ngl and greens / efa groups and by mrs UNK and mr coûteaux .    2.5206691572702193
mr désir , i note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution .    2.643097665275503
if the services of the presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled , it will be included .    3.273875798246377
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.716053081557172
( the sitting was closed at 8 . 14 p . m . )    1.869672629813388
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.588172984177108
mr president , i simply wanted to pass on some news . there was a terrorist attack this morning in madrid .    2.1798749333061282
someone UNK a car bomb and one person has died .    2.328828718536779
on behalf of my group , i once again condemn these terrorist acts .    2.4829583586225508
thank you , mrs UNK UNK .    2.7938189645178833
we had heard about this regrettable incident .    2.4125920615927137
unfortunately , the terrorist murderers are once again punishing spanish society . i note your comments with particular UNK , as you may expect , given that i too am spanish .    2.531548232289454
( the minutes were approved )    2.0038305127267746
resumption of the session    2.550836440705554
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday , 21 january 2000 .    2.40789829085472
madam president , allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the UNK tragedy .    3.256450709178588
two years ago , in UNK in italy , an american aeroplane from the UNK nato base cut through the UNK of a cable car during a low - flying exercise which exceeded safe limits , causing the deaths of more than 20 europeans .    2.5703195539609833
i therefore appeal to the president of this house and the president of the commission for them to stand UNK for immediate compensation from the u . s . authorities , and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims ' families .    3.504717968582431
mrs angelilli , thank you . i have taken note of your comment .    3.16154944341942
following a request to this effect , which i have received from a number of political groups , and following the meeting of the conference of presidents which has just been held , i propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance , pursuant to rule 50 of our rules of procedure , on the subject of the european union ' s reaction with regard to the talks in austria on forming a government .    3.1463687985413364
if you decide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introduced by speeches from mr seixas da costa , president - in - office of the council , and mr romano prodi , president of the commission .    2.7681016479408127
is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?    2.4713440930824864
madam president , i would like to express my support for the decision of the conference of presidents , and , since i publicly criticised the presidency in january , i would like to take this opportunity to say , both for myself and on behalf of the socialist group , that we now find the presidency ' s statements on this issue to be appropriate , and we agree on their basis , their importance and their form .    3.1454461017155273
madam president , it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with rule 50 of our rules of procedure .    2.874302665213262
this debate is topical , exceptionally important and urgent .    2.7313945598149587
we therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it .    3.238048099776748
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal ?    2.298133118258512
madam president , i shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which i consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the treaties , and with particular regard to article 7 of the treaty of amsterdam .    2.950209500845173
madam president , until now we believed that the european union was , according to the treaty of rome and the treaty of paris founding the european communities , and subsequently the union , an association of free , independent , sovereign states .    2.9894023762911837
even though many developments cast doubt on this , we did believe , in spite of everything , that this was the case and , more recently , reference was made , albeit half - UNK , to the principle of subsidiarity .    3.353717860292186
well , patently , if we do open this debate today , madam president , as you are requesting and as the conference of presidents is requesting , on the basis of rule 50 , we shall then be opening up a UNK breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments , enabling some other majority in this parliament , at some future time , to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free , regular , peaceful and democratic elections within a member state .    2.818445544864437
if you ratify .    2.8644247745422637
mr gollnisch , excuse me , you have one minute .    2.9204535873452024
i know that you always take particular care to ensure that the rules of procedure are observed .    2.711681014013355
madam president , i thought i had three minutes .    2.583965109555925
do forgive me .    2.8692696682185415
if you ratify this development , then you are ratifying the development of the union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the member states , and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a union .    2.8857617590664484
we have heard one speaker in favour and one against .    2.2169078848308366
i shall now , therefore , put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote .    3.3898243122297074
( parliament gave its assent )    2.0684259806454803
this debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business .    2.606455663635728
topical and urgent debate    3.188588329552281
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .    1.8738769413675036
talks in austria on forming a government    2.787170372507494
the next item is the debate on the talks in austria on forming a government .    2.091297503446184
i shall immediately give the floor to mr seixas da costa , president - in - office of the council .    2.0727893116314497
madam president , president of the commission , president - in - office of the council , the group of the party of european socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the european public .    2.606534421677326
let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts .    2.952333304139313
in any event , these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party UNK known as the austrian freedom party .    2.215994151825194
the europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered , and the socialist group condemns the insults which have been directed at the president of the french republic and the belgian government , but also at the socialists , who are european citizens as well , because , at the moment , the austrian socialists are being described as UNK to their country .    3.1876074623368362
i will say one thing . for many years i was a traitor to my country ; at least that was general franco ' s view .    2.341454887383827
i also believe that the commission , or president prodi , has acted as a guardian of the treaties .    3.3605858330392175
however , i would remind him that , during his inaugural debate , he described the commission as a european government .    2.7844211986477525
a government must have more UNK and more courage .    2.8618148223691446
that is what i am asking president prodi for at this moment .    2.8685603206671506
with all due respect to a commissioner as effective as mr fischler , and given that we have heard contradictory comments , depending on the translation , with regard to a possible request by president prodi for the resignation of mr fischler , i would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this house .    3.0247785813133006
this is an appeal to the majority of austrians who have not voted for haider , who have voted for the clearly democratic options , committed to europe , and i must point out that mr schüssel may have been minister for finance , but chancellor UNK also contributed to austria ' s integration process .    2.718595402453292
we should not be so politically partisan .    3.024222460068215
the accession of austria to the community was a joint venture .    3.1243559978067963
we all took part in it , not just one group .    3.3046538967873245
therefore , madam president , i believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the austrians to reconsider and reflect , because this type of menace , which we have suffered before in europe , may not only harm austria , but it may also spread , and i say this bearing history in mind .    3.291150242146617
therefore , apart from the apology which mr schüssel has made , offering us all kinds of guarantees , as did UNK and UNK in UNK in munich , i would like to know whether the ppe intends to implement measures in relation to the austrian people ' s party , if it goes ahead with this mad project .    2.8185270172742727
thirdly , if we do not stand up to this UNK alliance , i can assure you that we can forget the european union ' s main objective - enlargement - because , if we were UNK , UNK or UNK , what would we say , faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter ?    3.5201691629569027
i therefore think that this is a great day for european politics to commence .    2.9458472198575656
we support the council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option .    2.998931536795568
( applause from the pse group )    2.3025396186211906
madam president , we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the union , so that we can uphold them together .    3.5876327008130713
instead , we have been forced to debate the formal , substantial errors that have been made in the last few days .    3.4722437883147452
we are UNK by the political naivety of people who , with UNK words , have UNK mr haider ' s position in austria and made the union look ridiculous , riding roughshod over article 7 of the treaty by announcing UNK measures .    2.776181438220524
we have never before seen such serious , UNK interference in the internal affairs of a member state .    2.21708394348665
of course , we cannot violate the founding values of europe , and in this regard , the italian prime minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty : he mentioned the treaty of copenhagen , which i , like you , have never heard of because it does not exist .    2.9605133344047854
however , up UNK now , austria has committed no serious or persistent violation .    2.103353535737331
apart from UNK to interference , the statement by the presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the UNK of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for .    2.551037734760024
no political cohesion has so far come about , not even in the fight against organised crime , or in defence of the victims of genocide ; we do not have a currency that is even UNK stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty ; but it only took one minute of UNK fury to destroy the union ' s credibility .    2.591153813514516
sanctions can be imposed after the treaties have been violated , but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government .    2.2374728007615596
otherwise , how will we deal with communist countries which return to communism : will we throw them out of the union too if communists enter into government , or will UNK ' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything ?    2.439116286005736
( applause from the right ) it is via diplomacy , persuasion , knowledge , and solidarity , and not with threats or via anti - constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles .    2.3394355843912527
bilateral relations involve the states , so the 14 do not come into this .    2.819119784682125
this is riding roughshod over the european institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking , with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes . it is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions .    2.76281998985008
so many things set us apart from mr haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely italian UNK UNK region .    2.2921133893696757
however , we already knew this .    2.661657479709094
however , today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the union seem to have turned their backs on the union ' s democratic role .    3.336222874746032
we support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples , and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the treaty or human rights .    2.8529106938743976
we believe in europe , while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the union .    3.007621188530497
this is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks .    1.9883889645471684
we have built a europe with an unstable market , not a europe with principles , rights and politics .    2.7318021568997373
and these are the consequences !    3.8556693253283885
therefore , we can but call on the commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the austrian people , thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples .    2.757345902643362
madam president , today we have an appointment with hypocrisy .    2.9987440740409848
here we have a council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a state in the event of a serious and persistent breach .    2.5356569717046904
there are risks , as we are all aware , but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach .    3.3112285927007816
if we were to apply the criteria of articles 6 and 7 or the copenhagen criteria to the european union , then , most certainly , this european union could not become a member , although the countries of eastern europe are required to meet them .    3.2286516088116715
and if we were to speak of serious and persistent UNK , then perhaps we could mention some member states , such as italy and france , first and third , respectively , in the list of countries condemned by the council of europe and the strasbourg court .    3.4081270902633234
we could mention , my belgian friends , belgium and the dutroux case , the dozens upon dozens of children UNK , tortured , raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country , where inquiries are bogged down , making no headway .    1.9511684351934921
we could , if one third of the members of parliament so requested , require that the council and the commission look into the matter .    3.2615324294458437
we could ask ourselves why the austrians are rejecting 10 years , 13 years of party politics which has made one country - austria - corrupt and UNK , just as it is now UNK countries such as italy , belgium and other european union member states .    2.5906205796646926
we might well wonder why 76 % of belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56 % of french citizens have no confidence in their country ' s system of justice , and 53 % of italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in italian justice .    2.3080284938032096
madame president , my group , the edd , and especially my party , are very concerned by this debate .    3.128852185348027
we cannot , and we do not , support in any way the sentiments and politics of herr haider and we deplore his references to the third reich .    2.7978516902502903
we also , however , deplore the fact that your parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country , especially one which is part of the european union .    2.939511998739909
my party at home are certainly not UNK , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the european union very well .    3.8162977263683104
madame president , the people of austria have spoken by electing herr haider to their parliament .    2.91039732444742
i believe they gave him 28 % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government .    3.26186548208618
your parliament , may i suggest , madame president , should wait to see if the party of haider has an effect on the policies of that country .    2.8825222855905994
then , and only then , might you consider if human rights are affected .    2.794992665454481
your parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then , madame president and only then , may your parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the european union .    2.369774401770022
my reaction may come as a surprise when i say that i personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards austria in matters of respect for human rights , having a sense of responsibility for one ' s own past , and the stability of democracy .    2.990297858659604
the refusal of our government , down through the years , to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the second world war , together with their refusal to properly compensate the UNK victims and those forced into hard labour , have done a great deal to bolster this negative image .    2.218075519685103
this fpö has now entered into a coalition with the övp , due to the outcome of elections held on 3 october 1999 , when the previous government was voted out of office .    2.513447575852163
this is the citizen of a state ' s prerogative , for it is the founding principle of a democracy .    2.8862612861078736
when the talks between the spö and övp broke down , the socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the fpö for their support .    2.2716423079467383
we were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here !    1.9724036979452564
when we suddenly refused this offer , an inflammatory and UNK - UNK propaganda campaign began that is beyond our UNK to this day .    2.277012100580497
the fpö party is established in austria ' s political landscape .    2.991212624677769
the head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other UNK governments .    3.637672479015785
what many austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind , and why the campaign did not begin until the freedom party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the spö ?    2.2125995370666116
there is prejudice at work here , which - without going into our programme - is reducing the UNK hour of european history to a political UNK .    2.2694198103884147
i am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get UNK out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas UNK of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda , as , for example , the italian mep bertinotti did yesterday on italian tv when he accused mr haider of denying the holocaust .    2.315877743238955
shame on you mr bertinotti !    2.6876490429991446
you might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda .    2.6072337066946507
denouncing a democratically elected politician as a nazi does not make you an anti - fascist !    2.346350095756642
on the contrary , you are UNK the true victims of national socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did .    2.2137881530710795
your behaviour stems from your own prejudices , you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose .    2.432777803287309
the attacks against austria ' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a member state are an insult to the austrian people .    2.738934139834326
that is why we are indebted to the commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest .    2.8891370209580565
the new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy , the rights of the opposition , commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour .    2.3251977747999932
austria is a stable democracy ; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary .    2.468525817976552
austria is a UNK country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there .    2.7778622619268596
there is nothing unusual about what is happening in austria : there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections , in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found .    2.305500570217292
there will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition .    2.687574857580433
the austrian people ' s party , which i represent here in this parliament , used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the eu and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the european union , and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement .    3.0842968589526563
we respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our member states as to the way ahead for austria .    2.8203424267595527
our understanding UNK from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present .    2.864405845695464
our country was not just the first victim of the hitler dictatorship , many people were perpetrators too , although i refute any suggestion of collective guilt .    2.3236792176520087
the övp played no small part in helping austria find its way into the european union .    2.1994133377033176
my country ' s place is not outside the european union but in it .    3.3378300250258888
. , with all the rights and commitments that this entails !    3.0943645741228543
any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto , and not according to the UNK put about both by political UNK and the international media .    3.1789571633116656
a declared belief in human rights , democracy and the rule of law , in an honest UNK of austria ' s role in the past , in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century , the holocaust , will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the övp and fpö .    2.718758181201381
my party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of european politics and continues to be rooted in the european community of values !    2.819725773319024
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
not even mr UNK ' s web of lies or mrs stenzel ' s words of UNK can do anything to change that .    2.552791682251426
for the day has UNK : two irresponsible politicians , consumed with a UNK for power , are selling austria ' s image , political role , and to some extent even its economic interests , down the river !    2.449300709173554
( applause , heckling )    2.6192060982189393
they are trading this in for a head of government ' s position and for membership of a government .    2.8011260174449317
they are just as prepared to take on board the fact that austria will go from being a UNK country to a UNK one , as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens .    2.9438753822326422
i believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against haider and his brand of politics , and especially my colleagues in the social democratic delegation in this chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community , insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives , are grave and also inappropriate .    2.691451425609939
however , my criticism - and i freely admit this - my UNK , is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so , messrs schüssel and haider and their parties , .    2.3685992525498984
. and that includes their representatives in this parliament .    3.0603235758371037
mr poettering , it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as i am , albeit for different reasons , for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions .    2.8331303795466742
you are having to defend a certain mr schüssel , you are having to UNK with schüssel as he is today and who , as i understand it , was recently told not to come to the representatives of the christian democratic party ' s summit meeting .    2.78517028729236
the argument that mr poettering himself used has come into play , i . e . that it would only be possible to deprive haider of his UNK if he were to be integrated into the political system .    2.794418288585787
however , in my view , he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this , into our political system , and into the europe of today , than any other extreme right - wing movement .    2.6555824906034404
anyone who feeds on prejudice towards UNK and ethnic minorities and gives UNK to these prejudices , whose programme features UNK and anti - liberalism , who displays UNK behaviour and arrogance in their international relations , and who has never yet UNK themselves clearly and unequivocally from national socialism , has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate !    1.8757610088614454
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
this historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the conservatives for having UNK with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be UNK .    2.2933848032080553
that is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self - sacrifice of the övp - is sustained rather than kept in check .    2.23142663463934
i understand that europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government .    2.9497533043870927
however , by the same token , there is another austria , the one where UNK thousand people demonstrated against the fpö having any involvement in government , and who will continue to demonstrate against this government .    2.90699999461794
i urge you to support this europe and to support and help this austria !    2.9867126282432337
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
the more powerful this europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the europe of today , the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right - wing extremism .    2.464563775613659
for europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and UNK , or even against a UNK into barbarism .    2.7566970551757968
please support the austrian people against this government !    2.960646909275164
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
madam president , this is an historic moment , as it is now , at last , quite clear to us all that the european union has gradually developed into a community of values .    3.56995937902019
we see this , now that the government of one member state is being joined by a party which , as is known , does not respect all these values .    3.189167665759188
i would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the council was justified , as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the european union , meaning this is also a matter for the council and not merely an internal affair of austria ' s .    3.666898166604604
as members of parliament , we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever .    3.723588998191327
it is more important than ever that respect for , and non - violation of , human values and the rights of minorities , including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the european union , form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the eu , and , for this reason , the charter of fundamental rights must be made legally binding .    3.491152877746216
it must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration .    2.950763302998338
as important is the fact that austria ' s forces of democracy should be given support , as none of us wishes to isolate the country .    2.9356294942129
we know that most austrians respect these values .    2.3523246070224495
they have also shown how they feel : not all the demonstrations have taken place outside austria .    2.3633843082697905
doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in austrian policy for a long time .    2.5664926065318765
i believe parliament should support these forces of democracy .    2.342008741718169
i also appeal to the austrian president , that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces .    2.724164743793023
madam president , i would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group , francis wurtz , reminded us of just now .    2.78358668823079
i welcome the statements by the presidency of the council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an austrian government that includes jörg haider ' s party .    2.9075186377167315
the fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because , as you know , we essentially disagree with the policies made by europe , with its economic and social policies , its democratic deficit and the member states ' involvement in the terrible war in the balkans .    3.2570982314050703
our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today : this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational , neo - nazi element in europe is extraordinary .    2.08929760621568
this danger does not concern austria , it concerns europe .    2.2427907109637224
we are talking about us , not austria .    2.6633990488642936
we know the social causes which contribute , along with unemployment and instability , to UNK tendencies towards this ; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia , racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right - wing groups to settle accounts with nazism , we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an UNK mixture being created in europe .    2.3199333959577224
not only the UNK region , but all our countries are involved : the conditions are being created whereby democracy and european civilisation may once again come under threat .    2.28843028884105
the position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation .    3.7946074105663183
europe is showing that it has not forgotten UNK ; europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past .    2.4373603899630742
now , though , it should follow through with its actions , and the first to follow through should be the commission , which , however , has been obscure and weak on this , making the value of the presidency ' s position even more apparent .    4.203145935887191
this is the change we must impose on the commission ' s action .    3.0519728409119815
madam president , despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples , which opposes fascism , nazism or communism , both new and old , and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the austrian people , we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by parliament .    2.6225364955859933
in the manifesto of the austrian democratic freedom party , there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , fundamental freedoms or the rule of law , enshrined in article 6 of the treaties .    3.0034629308097873
i would , however , like to draw your attention to the fact that the president - in - office , who has been so critical of austria , has recently consigned the inhabitants of UNK to the sovereign rule of the people ' s democratic republic of china .    3.0936978940198507
perhaps , in order to strengthen the union ' s democracy , it would now be appropriate to isolate austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the austrian citizens , while bringing turkey and its " grey UNK " into europe .    2.6419009830132607
madam president , we are debating an extremely serious issue .    3.086558459986822
we are debating nothing less than the presence in a member state ' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the UNK and moral bases of the union enshrined in its founding treaties .    2.9563849816888492
a simple reading of chapter 4 , article 1 of the austrian freedom party ' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience UNK .    2.4304081166700544
the view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others , as is written here , UNK old UNK of the century which we have just left behind , which some UNK have described as the century of horrors ; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind mr haider ' s manifesto has stirred up once again , to our UNK .    2.4659526689395657
of course austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non - interference in the internal affairs of a member state .    2.7835584045584385
however , that is not the problem .    4.341104674964656
the question is whether the union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a member state which includes such a party .    2.703085278639609
our answer to this crucial question is no .    2.9015137312206947
leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations , leaving aside possible UNK based on other people ' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests , the spanish delegation of the people ' s group of this parliament , in full agreement with the spanish people ' s party and the spanish government , clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 january by the portuguese presidency of the council .    2.651473382596352
we agree with its substance , its tone and its scope .    2.3163717466893528
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
history is a compendium of events which could have been avoided .    2.6603564103703845
therefore , madam president , the union and the assembly must send an unequivocal message , rejecting of the tiger of intolerance , xenophobia and totalitarianism , so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of UNK , UNK and UNK which mark europe ' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price .    2.744651764829956
( loud applause )    2.301445795846968
madam president , the european union was built upon the idea ' never again ' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia , concentration camps , anti - semitism , heightened nationalism or war .    2.2957335476388625
the one and only significance of the european union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de UNK to any ideal of UNK within the heart of europe , and which is still highly topical today .    2.8448080270796643
it is not true to say that , when a government forms an alliance with neo - fascists somewhere in europe , this is merely a question of national sovereignty .    3.2712937623167506
for this union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances .    2.2372123368989496
it is a community that is UNK to exist , in which , when the main thing is under threat , when values are under threat , all democrats must UNK over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again .    2.8401870185035785
let us learn the lessons of the past .    2.9222775898884774
in the thirties , when adolf hitler was democratically elected , although with a minority , many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and , mr poettering , in france , a number of men and women , on the right wing but perhaps of other political UNK too , thought , ' better hitler in france than the front UNK . '    2.576188134053709
they put their own petty UNK first , and the rest is history .    2.8810420593507176
we must make a rapid , strong and united response .    2.3835145651368412
i would have liked to hear your discussion with the austrian president , mr poettering . we are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance .    2.62289121476792
so our response must be rapid and strong .    2.3766132491503917
of course , the treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable ; i was almost going to say ' irreparable ' .    2.252448211364172
history has taught us that fascists start to blow hot and cold : using heated words first , in populist , xenophobic speeches , and then UNK words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to UNK them gradually , poisoning them , until the day they start to take action .    2.1928584418806225
and when that day comes , it is too late .    3.1949012072932312
so our treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late , but we are not at that point : today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point .    3.6670216281013426
i support the council proposals in this , while deploring a certain lack of strength , a certain spinelessness , on the part of the commission which will , however , have to be vigilant on a day - by - day basis , with determination over time , since fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy , they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end .    2.7412276514391563
our response must be rapid .    2.672722852086684
madam president , i am pleased about the fact that , in austria , the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes , in my eyes , a huge victory for democracy .    3.151158894327913
let there be no doubt about it : we decline with thanks a europe which develops into a kind of " big brother " and which keeps watch over left - wing political correctness in one member state or another in a stalinist way and using stalinist methods .    2.1735722809870057
european democracy and austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a belgian government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party , which was condemned by the court , to the post of european commissioner .    2.5191885515097545
today , we thank the austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech .    2.46222241134172
madam president , this debate was opened by mr da costa , who merely confirms that the eu presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the member states .    2.8380333836696097
this debate , and the background to it , reinforced the point that the council , the commission and this parliament itself are dominated by socialists .    4.1430112613513375
my delegation of 37 conservative and UNK members from the united kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy , programme and tone of austria ' s freedom party .    2.21114624914777
we share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history , in particular world war ii , but also its policies on enlargement , on immigration , on race and its attitude to the european union itself .    2.754593592728621
we were also outraged , however , at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny , the terror and the excesses of the former ussr .    2.6610314321676034
even today , surely it is high time for the party of european socialists to break their UNK links with china ' s communist party .    2.494482354304799
not a word was said by these same eu governments about coalition governments involving fellow - travelling communists in french or italian governments , or in german state governments , or even the british government ' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in northern ireland today .    2.110499491754982
this , madam president , is the hypocrisy of the left .    3.50040052894623
so we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards , especially of the british government and the other largely socialist heads of eu governments and include that of the united states .    2.630246959314146
we should recognise , however , that the democratic process sometimes produces UNK results .    3.0103135584161214
this requires action to address the underlying causes , including an examination of the electoral process itself .    2.5711551988238313
that should be our task , not political UNK .    2.835143213686759
madam president , representative of the council , commissioner , a week ago , the big international holocaust conference ended in stockholm .    2.860514491668453
its aim was to combat the UNK and the evil in today ' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo - nazism .    3.133368898645289
it would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite , at this time , into the institutions of the eu , a xenophobic party which UNK with nazi ideas .    3.2288661779418293
secondly , i want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations .    3.465035939507187
we demand of the candidate states and of the countries with which the eu cooperates under the lomé agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours .    3.109084758761978
we must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned .    3.2519244955076565
that is why we are reacting against this carry - on in austria .    2.2017451522944755
we are at a watershed in the history of the european union .    2.6834807304893395
the union is not only an economic community but also a community of values , something which we take seriously . something has happened .    3.080662399587461
the european union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its UNK .    2.8550857836963175
madam president , as everyone has said , this is a very important day . it is the day of the first debate of european political life .    3.7946974258202113
and this is not pure chance .    3.5721297456411025
i feel that today ' s meeting is not a meeting of europe , our institutions , with austria or mr haider ' s party .    3.3761426385550926
it is the meeting of europe with itself , with its raison d ' être , with the reasons why we are here in this chamber .    3.4268257203077694
this chamber was not made for goods , it was not made for money .    3.0363849172428123
this chamber , and the european institutions , were build to uphold values , morality and a certain spirit .    3.256328951666209
in the twentieth century , we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk , and morality , values and the spirit which i mentioned can be UNK affected by UNK which have just one name : nationalist glorification , populism and the concept of racial superiority .    2.6615797825854193
the fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of mr haider ' s party , the fpö , to find nationalist glorification , populism and racial superiority in every chapter .    2.4907180040271317
reading only one sentence which my friend , mr vidal - quadras , has previously mentioned , " the nation is defined by its location , culture and race , locally , ethnically and culturally . "    1.9288915118770624
well , we cannot accept such statements .    3.1825514241375217
this is the reason why i feel that the european parliament , which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the council or the commission , must pay tribute to those people in the various states and european institutions who had the courage to say no , and it must say , madam president , that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit , and in clear terms declare , without UNK , its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in austria , UNK the statement made on the day of the munich agreement by a great french christian democrat who said that , if you are going to have to say no , then the best time to do so is right at the beginning .    3.1392231158665296
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
madam president , we the belgian christian democrats are concerned as , fortunately , are a great many other members too .    2.405477097433493
the coalition which is being created in one of the member states is clearly an austrian affair but undoubtedly has a european dimension too .    2.9556672967387567
because what is it that unites us in europe ? surely it is the values and principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , more than anything .    3.164734444490742
the austrian freedom party leader , mr haider , has repeatedly UNK these values .    2.4614820725613304
he also UNK the basic forms of diplomatic UNK .    2.5770352580947193
he is a dangerous man .    3.0471947814262834
the christian democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme - right voters but never to negotiate with extreme - right leaders .    2.2872266203899123
values should take precedence over power .    2.738114441309126
we deplore , therefore , what is happening in austria .    3.5285386626611697
in fact , we were shaken by it .    2.684607310749715
we are extremely disappointed .    2.741299783262107
as a last resort , we would ask the övp to look into alternatives .    2.9936224612151396
we keep reminding them about article 6 of the treaty .    2.357477000892903
we continue to fight against the UNK of the extreme right .    3.956692908730135
if , despite this , the coalition goes ahead , we would urge the övp party members to ensure that the principles and values which UNK european integration are observed in political programmes , both in word and deed .    2.78164528193859
madam president , austria awaits a heavy responsibility .    2.2474751393855152
madam president , it is clear that we in this parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting mr haider and his politics , but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics .    2.972591173238023
have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the council presidency last weekend are having in austria itself ?    2.6542218050712
have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation UNK from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ?    2.751908593235857
have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow mep was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in austria in the course of the next few days ?    2.753453609594985
from all accounts , this would only serve to strengthen haider .    2.8231240177528756
who would want this to happen ?    2.8635773253611068
is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ?    2.3908205249030465
europe is a community of law .    3.5639284335333894
democracy , respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold .    3.106872824748268
one of the UNK of democracy is that we should not UNK of electoral outcomes but respect them , and that is why we must respect the fact that the austrians , by virtue of their political culture , voted as they did .    3.413699253883213
it is for reasons of UNK that the president - in - office of the council ought not to have made the statement he did , and in a manner that goes against the treaty .    2.959120023543623
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
madam president , they say , where i come from , ' it ' s three times for a UNK ' , and three times , as i think you will discover in the course of that debate , i UNK my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent , and on several occasions , a moving debate .    2.61159309253714
first of all , could i express my thanks on behalf of president prodi and my colleagues in the commission for the support and understanding offered by several members of the house to the position taken by the commission in the statement that we made yesterday .    3.5395540864535158
i must respond also to the fact , of course , that there were references during the debate - and i use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity , the complacency and the fragility of the commission ' s opinion .    3.4528844951479254
i am duty - bound to say to this house , there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered , or indeed the action taken , by the commission on this issue .    3.178030998591152
we made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as did the president this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen member states in their statement on monday .    3.005170614901082
thirdly , we expressed , in very explicit terms , that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of article 6 of the treaty ; and that we will take our part under article 7 of the treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld .    2.9112401799362466
there is no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all .    2.2468800545436913
and , when i say that the commission took that view , i include my dear colleague franz fischler , who is from austria ; and who , once again , demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a member of the european commission , under UNK , in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning .    2.922665379648909
anyone , therefore , who invites franz fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is austrian , should examine their own motives in the context of a debate , which has been necessarily UNK by references to xenophobia and even more UNK UNK in this world .    2.763256917555331
i say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , franz fischler .    2.3291848420150094
could i also say , madam president , that the understanding of the presidency , the portuguese presidency , for our position , was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by mr da costa when he said , and i quote him , that ' portugal and the other member states want to ensure that the working of the community machine is not affected by the current situation ' .    3.3749064954589447
that surely is in everyone ' s interests .    2.537749851907527
in order to ensure that the treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the community machine , we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday .    3.048487322993414
we will continue to do that , madam president , without fear or favour .    3.131506582572327
that is our duty .    3.0472557063740475
it is also a matter of conviction .    3.1517293888764972
my final point is this .    2.7315745656757855
we understand the context of this essential debate .    2.94724169421255
there are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with herr haider ' s offensive statements , the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of UNK aggressive statements with apologies , sometimes on successive days .    2.1052546671759442
we understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of nazism .    2.700085334290509
and , when we recall that , like many others on all sides of this house , my and my colleagues ' UNK are naturally aroused .    3.027772441400284
however , the commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct .    3.5931546498063054
and that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning .    2.9469755161675995
that is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law . without fragility , without complacency , without ambiguity , but in the service of the whole union and every member state of the union and its people .    2.8702247838832675
we will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as mr cox said in the debate , ' necessarily with acute vigilance ' .    2.573887505697339
i wonder , since mr da costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the chamber , whether mr kinnock could confirm that the commission supports the view explicitly stated by mr da costa today and in the recent statement by the presidency on behalf of the heads of government .    2.763974890377882
does the commission support the council ?    2.924322522125655
madam president , when the commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen member states and shares the concern that gave rise to that view , i think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning , as soon as the commission could discuss the issue , it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the member states .    2.9276193183198402
thank you , commissioner kinnock .    2.405210422417943
i think that we have just had a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it .    3.050673057346494
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .    2.87402022708943
the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed .    2.226232765700344
the vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow .    1.8670405981068408
the next item is the commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle .    2.232240373234318
i want to start by saying that i am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it has been written together with david byrne and erkki liikanen .    3.0965391010519236
the precautionary principle is not a new concept .    3.6209827049785592
it has been used by the community for some time now in a range of policy areas , environmental , human , animal and plant health ; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the ec treaty since maastricht .    2.9596981776516906
it also appears in a range of international texts , for example , the rio declaration and most recently the bio - safety protocol .    2.4050238511003674
the essence of the precautionary principle is clear .    3.2970641861245698
it involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear , but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action .    2.322281601272263
however , the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years .    2.863290018323769
events such as the bse and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary .    2.37511419030147
in view of this growing interest , the commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle .    3.5902256376213537
the basic aim of the communication is twofold .    3.0165934364798366
to explain in a clear and coherent way how the commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles .    2.3345782145391496
the commission ' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental , human , animal and plant health .    2.8512211995527905
of course , this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures , but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear .    2.509746373593116
as such , while the precautionary principle does not involve the UNK of science , as some have alleged , it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics .    2.9403597466846416
the initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision - makers are prepared to accept for society .    2.870187877311313
it is therefore political by nature .    2.4176389409278203
however , the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper .    2.6208840310847497
measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is , we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut .    2.7754225923112954
they must be non - discriminatory in their application , that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin .    2.637321604331411
and they must be consistent with similar measures already taken .    2.985861583603613
for example , if one product has been approved , similar products should also be approved .    2.6644547549572373
measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action ; that is , the measures should be cost - effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment , that is the burden of proof .    2.7270238793127426
all these elements have to apply UNK .    2.6754263828825375
it is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures , which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle . for example , a research programme , public information campaigns , recommendations and so on .    2.946877259051423
applying the precautionary principle does not , therefore , automatically imply a ban .    3.2453296181267435
this communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it is the first time that the commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use .    3.534287936565712
by setting out in some detail how the commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle , we hope to be able to clarify the situation at community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at european and international level .    2.7761774767934644
mr president , commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .    2.4338870916750754
i have three short questions , the first being as follows .    2.6992777258242824
we have been awaiting a common communication from the commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the commission speaks with one voice .    3.189605384833179
does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the commissioners for industry , foreign trade , competition and the internal market ?    2.502997741522595
i am sure that your answer to this will be " yes " but i would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be ?    3.0198022103605093
my next question , mrs wallström , is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors , for example ?    2.622358317625973
lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation ?    2.7283951936127004
in other words , will each proposal contain an additional UNK stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached ?    2.6334261738688243
. thank you very much , UNK roth - behrendt , for these questions .    2.7201182656263208
of course , this is shared by the whole commission .    3.128696887585053
this is a common communication which was written by the three of us , david byrne , erkki liikanen and myself , but it has been passed unanimously in the commission today .    3.083468080678263
it received strong support from the rest of the commissioners and it has been through an UNK consultation in the whole of the commission .    3.1277769031866787
so we have really worked through this document and i am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document .    2.8830438410504784
yes , i would say we already use this way of working with different , difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example .    2.6383210620132593
and , i am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle .    3.351373997594433
it has been mainly used in the environmental field , but , of course also when it comes to human health .    3.4546661613541887
so , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it .    3.181048603235191
mr president , commissioner , regarding the relationship between science , on the one hand , and applying the precautionary principle on the other , the communication states that UNK that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence .    2.8733196588075804
needless to say , this accords science a great deal of power .    2.7056620404672715
we might ask ourselves , what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for ?    2.3216587005595457
the communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied , provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists .    2.997080290844053
i would like to ask , what is , then , the definition of a recognised minority ?    3.1839652690688247
how would you describe this ?    2.7535702054024105
what establishes a recognised minority ?    2.5420553351098456
if a political decision is involved , i would also like to ask : who takes this political decision ?    3.1427828240892497
the commission ?    3.1282228168312654
the council ?    3.104573348374601
and to what extent will the european parliament be able to play a role in this ?    4.159874852853445
what is the role of the scientific committees ?    3.337619432682979
what , also , will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up ?    3.9874933559094137
finally , will this whole decision - making process be carried out in a transparent , public way ?    2.826856450818575
these are my three questions .    2.622234264054477
. yes , mr president , that is true .    5.427888721165979
there were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear , but i will try to answer some questions .    2.7994805483790985
who will take the decision , who are the decision - makers ?    4.13183111134781
well , that depends on who the legislators are .    2.506808914489314
this is part of risk management .    2.813139100576611
they have to look at , for example , the concerns of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case .    3.4840401252340327
however , it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle .    3.5549475114464197
it can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete .    2.4326816742826765
that is , of course , where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science .    2.753176508922771
we use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be done in the future .    2.7201720397835434
you have to see this as a tool for risk management .    3.479060549629241
you have to decide whether you want to put people in danger , for example , or if you want to protect the environment ; and you have to look at the science that is available .    3.4960697891224055
you have to assess all that and evaluate the science .    2.5999579788679235
then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not .    3.3621643447813003
so , there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today .    2.834126881085028
mr president , i have a question concerning an actual , concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle .    2.966204596368947
it is about brominated flame retardants .    2.5516516148331743
it is a fact that these substances are now being discovered . there are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment .    2.601321176350843
there are many people who maintain that they entail major risks , while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are .    2.190639334213044
recently , both sweden and denmark urged the commission in the council of ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants .    3.0120910008173998
i am wondering , therefore , if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative .    3.047491155362019
. ( sv ) mr president , thank you very much , mr sjöstedt , for this question .    2.931594585127747
the issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one .    2.8662326264980362
it was raised quite recently in the environment council by a number of ministers who want the commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done .    3.173386940033547
we are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do .    2.86508636784537
allow me to remind you , however , that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban .    3.23190373583679
there may be a series of different measures which can be taken .    3.4522409616300087
it ought not , therefore , to be immediately interpreted as a ban .    3.0065406160334547
where brominated flame retardants are concerned , there may eventually be a ban , but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken .    3.0655697364657932
this issue is extremely topical .    2.995483854410073
the commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done .    2.7597671135789605
you said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier .    3.4656679048795627
is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the atlantic ocean ?    2.8978374472530493
i think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone - treated beef and genetically modified crops .    2.3310813749910646
will the americans take the same view of this point as we do ?    2.9918170938337862
. ( sv ) mr president , i am pleased to be able to tell you that , in montreal , we have just signed a protocol concerning bio - safety .    3.2122785931917957
we succeeded there in agreeing , at an international forum , as to the definition of the precautionary principle .    2.752210827105905
i consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol .    2.7653890773860734
i believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle .    2.3813716071804194
we are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted .    4.2609950753336205
it is , moreover , also accepted as an important and effective tool .    2.796708305905851
mr president , i have two questions . i shall try to be very brief indeed .    3.0051707789017192
the first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle .    3.3074119312669406
as i have understood it , there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood .    3.3027612408847427
is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out , including a cost - benefit analysis ?    2.5574219565411687
in that case , i am rather concerned , because the idea was really that a cost - benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced . instead , the precautionary principle should come first .    3.1049864042949125
my second question concerns the burden of proof .    2.368179881946275
i remember margot wallström being introduced as commissioner in the committee .    2.451937489879952
at that time , she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof .    2.5117637291520083
in other words , a product ' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous .    2.397873298623424
i want to know whether this also applies in the document which the commission has presented now .    3.53061153316498
. ( sv ) thank you , mrs UNK .    2.770488494325781
these are two important questions , and it is good that i should be given the opportunity to clarify them .    3.57581720613494
no , one must not begin by carrying out a cost - benefit analysis . instead , the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know , of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals .    2.6425015224154604
when , on the other hand , the decision has been made to take a certain measure , the one chosen ought to be cost - effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness .    3.1025082002999502
it is not , therefore , the case that one must begin with a cost - benefit analysis .    2.905695026478724
the second question concerns the reversed burden of proof .    2.4323285618422537
it is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases .    3.251252077079431
i have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this .    3.293940526007041
there , however , we are concerned with that particular area , whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern .    3.1464692790740996
therefore , the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context . instead , it is a question of political decision - making and of the bases for this .    3.0770074747869494
it is , however , perfectly correct that , when it comes , for example , to chemicals , we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof .    3.2809252169218124
mr president , i believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work , otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible .    3.2649029870313115
i will give an example : a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind . it is therefore a UNK substance .    2.4158931808646513
very well , it is a fungicide , it UNK off mould .    3.719658247917792
this UNK has been demonstrated by just one english laboratory , perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests .    2.936363028823368
now , in my opinion , given that this is such a serious risk to health , the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market , which new zealand has done , for example .    3.049086872850173
so i want to put this question to you . when human health is at stake , or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected , should we not perhaps carry out a cost - benefit analysis ?    2.722350839605767
the cost of a baby being born blind is too high ; there are no benefits that can compensate for this .    2.4653107851574836
in short , commissioner , i would therefore like to know whether in this case , the precautionary principle as you understand it , would in any case , require the product to be taken off the market , until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary .    3.057620456031865
. ( sv ) mr president , no one wants more than i do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people ' s health and the environment .    3.3854780345679893
obviously , i cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here , but i shall go directly back and see what i can obtain in the way of information about this particular case .    2.976688616334706
the truth , of course , is that a great many member states , and no doubt other nations too , have taken measures to protect their populations ' health which amount to using the precautionary principle , even if it has not always been called that .    3.219131924016851
naturally , it is not in the first place a question of cost ; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided .    3.2631089800565922
nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure .    2.534841224100794
i think , however , it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken , it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between .    3.4483433347994388
in those circumstances , consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result .    2.993069493089789
i cannot UNK telling you about an occasion when the expression cost - effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it , namely when i was on a visit to africa .    2.0716706684775446
at a UNK for aids patients , i met two irish catholic UNK who were UNK for dying aids patients .    2.1841561326778924
they were the first to say that , each day , they must think about doing what is most cost - effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there . we must be very careful about how we use resources .    2.7082598089725027
i believe we can learn something from this .    2.760718395787251
as is also explained in the present communication , it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost - benefit analysis .    2.8818123346399998
consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge , and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people ' s health .    3.5480351490018447
mr president , it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions !    3.109651302805212
commissioner , i would like to come back again to my first question , when i asked about the other commissioners , for it may have sounded as though i was in UNK .    3.0532118485610202
indeed you responded in kind , as i knew you would do .    2.767777002735694
i would like to draw your attention to something mr goodwill asked , that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the european union .    2.4626561209156628
i have good reason for asking this .    2.667030434535618
as you rightly said , the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where , as yet , there is no scientific evidence .    3.3145399629553776
how can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time , for example by our partners in the usa , on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes ?    2.895136166162016
how can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy , will not , as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors , keep pulling the carpet from UNK you ?    2.49482233309141
that is exactly what it is all about , otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here , commissioner !    3.0685600981502805
mr president , i think it is extremely important to point to the present communication ' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of UNK UNK to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons .    3.305943962241493
i am certain that we are going to have more conflicts , for example with the united states .    3.4808157561229893
we should not be so naïve as to think otherwise .    2.6871190903356177
ever since we signed this protocol in montreal , we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment , health and trade .    2.2473029482532665
this constitutes a good example , therefore .    2.897657153004752
we should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily .    3.611731861547232
we now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle , and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it , something which is clearly established in the present communication .    3.126013790001753
thank you , commissioner .    2.120450226877885
the focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed , so to speak , as more than an ordinary aspect of administration , even though , as we have been able to establish from the interventions , questions and replies , it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance .    2.8095818504728323
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0018 / 2000 ) by mr dimitrakopoulos and mr leinen , on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the convening of the intergovernmental conference [ 14094 / 1999 - c5 - 0341 / 1999 - 1999 / 0825 ( cns ) ] .    2.1120170374679317
mr president , i will begin by thanking the portuguese presidency and the commission for all our recent very useful contacts .    3.0003468188116766
let me also once more thank my co - rapporteur mr leinen for our excellent collaboration .    2.0549289192224114
the intergovernmental conference that is about to begin is important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement .    3.1285443249039293
the work of the conference will determine the structure and method based on which europe will be functioning in the twentieth century .    2.6487992064569856
for the european union of the future to be able to function more effectively , more democratically and with complete transparency , clearly what we need is an extensive and in - depth reform of the institutions and the way they work .    3.282219971285506
this is because the helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the european union ' s institutional bodies .    2.7015815759154247
i will not repeat which ones , because everyone knows .    2.4716841493022836
my conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very UNK demands of the peoples of europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the european union is already involved , namely enlargement .    3.052921991075522
granted this , the new intergovernmental conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which , properly addressed , would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the european union ' s institutions .    2.9505605166118776
just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which , for that very reason , are highly visible to the european public .    2.9144207483330185
in its numerous debates and its reports so far the european parliament has openly supported the convening of the intergovernmental conference .    2.4452756853971627
at the same time , however , i am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform , i repeat , of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the european public such as health , energy , culture , transport and even tourism .    3.0207889738641267
whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point i would like to UNK the political conduct of the portuguese presidency , which has repeatedly made a commitment to the european parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end .    3.614296305385492
all the same , whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every member state to the intergovernmental conference .    2.590341750476954
this is because the institutional framework within which europe will operate in the future is a foundation of european integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the union ' s member states .    3.332508746049724
in light of what i have said , i ask parliament to approve the opinion which mr leinen and i have put before you , so that on 14 february , the work of the intergovernmental conference can begin and our two representatives , mr brok and mr tsatsos , can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the european parliament ' s backing .    2.974911253059801
the same applies to the commission and i would again like to thank commissioner barnier for his collaboration with the european parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us .    3.674441552629202
mr president , the group of the european people ' s party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the european council in helsinki .    2.887230379126494
it seemed to us that the agenda lacked content , because our group was thinking in terms of the treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the union ' s institutions .    3.055184448200604
in helsinki , the governments approved the idea that , as long as the european union consists of fewer than 21 states , a minimal reform would be sufficient . with more than 21 , a deeper reform would become necessary .    2.7898735571337836
it is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform .    2.0424556095152524
we are therefore thinking in terms of the treaty and we want the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference to allow for a deeper reform of the union .    3.825370831682794
having said this , mr president , this parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the conference .    3.57544196640064
we could have voted on the UNK of this month and the conference would not have been able to start on the UNK .    3.4730033388611914
however , we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place , precisely in order to facilitate enlargement .    3.61331008182755
mr president , i am very happy to be able to say this to the portuguese presidency because it has earned great respect in this assembly .    2.845168531468639
the portuguese presidency shares many of this parliament ' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the intergovernmental conference is widened to include other essential issues .    2.8032117036379245
mr president , i would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the european parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the european parliament itself .    3.176901117051021
however , the european parliament will be reinforced politically by the treaty resulting from this intergovernmental conference . this is for one very simple reason : according to the agreements made in helsinki , this intergovernmental conference will lead to issues , which are currently decided unanimously , being decided by a qualified majority .    3.0217074132680164
therefore , the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase .    3.014354182733651
it is already established within the community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with parliament .    2.3070160195973273
therefore , since the qualified majority will be extended , there will also be more codecision with parliament .    2.9283132929427316
however , this parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational european institution if it did not consider the political design of the union .    2.4352597089500287
that it is what we are doing .    4.343572396521504
we believe that , in the political design of the union , other issues need to be dealt with .    4.083609980181111
these include , amongst others , the incorporation into the treaty of security and defence issues , which have made much progress recently , but which must be incorporated into the treaty .    3.3718324111857094
of course there is also the charter of fundamental rights , and work began on its wording yesterday , which i believe has started very positively .    2.7563561573336686
we are going to work seriously to ensure that the europeans come to see being european as an advantage and that european citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the union ' s institutions .    2.6633220168339364
therefore , mr president , our proposals , which we will specify in another report , together with the proposals of the commission , which has produced an excellent document - and i am happy to be able to say this here to mr barnier - are going to be used as conference documents .    3.7486358783806315
we will talk about this on another day .    2.521103378796387
today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for its part , the group of the european people ' s party , mr president , is ready to give that green light .    3.064097189163555
mr president , for the socialist group i can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the constitutional affairs committee .    3.42283652008799
we are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the igc precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the portuguese presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the igc be widened .    3.064554261689588
the amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term , because they are very important subjects in themselves .    3.2873181227912753
let us call them the first three subjects of the igc .    2.548879173750756
these first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our member states during the last igc .    2.5665564724147156
they did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study .    2.339809573143033
they need a political deal .    2.6790676099936044
it is more a question of nine minutes , perhaps nine hours if it is difficult , locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects , not nine months .    2.5420880478583228
in those circumstances it would be UNK not to widen the agenda .    3.0128226692582167
there are other issues that should UNK be looked at , especially before such a large widening of the union to so many new countries .    2.692008646976557
nobody is asking for an igc of the maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated .    2.1115785507973754
however , there are six , seven , eight , nine perhaps , subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address .    2.420998287645507
there is time .    2.9086441101910685
remember the igc that led to the single european act .    3.0263097411300355
it lasted only five months .    2.5786793957314225
the igc that led to the enormous maastricht treaty lasted a year .    2.490399302840034
only the amsterdam treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the british election if you were going to have any outcome from that igc so that was a different reason .    2.706217973808961
a year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda .    2.965929729768979
i am pleased to see that the commission shares our view .    3.166783257473228
the commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles .    2.2728884599238808
i thank the commission for doing that even if , of course , i do not agree with everything the commission said .    3.1999698212565475
i think there are some gaps in what they have put forward .    3.01824056732147
nonetheless the commission has provided a service and i pay tribute to commissioner barnier who is here with us today for doing that .    2.603402636236377
they have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this igc .    3.369161628000437
that is all to the good .    3.007196017019245
the parliament , the council presidency and the commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda .    3.6786679338434256
i wish you every success , president of the council , in making sure that the european council agrees to this agenda and that on valentine ' s day when you start off the igc it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion , also when the french presidency takes over , by the end of this year .    2.8611935709547933
we should no longer be worried that the agenda for the igc will be restricted .    2.921533646216695
that is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 member states yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner .    2.620452098599719
it is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some member states , especially britain and france , seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty .    2.216432212617552
it is vital that the igc prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the treaty .    2.5964618227158702
one part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the court .    3.812540565387605
another is for the union itself to sign up to the european convention .    4.177636702337707
another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside european union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build european parliamentary democracy .    2.2662737631284218
my group strongly welcomes the igc and will be contributing to this treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent .    2.3562148298680015
we would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion , and frankly , we did not appreciate the discourtesy the portuguese presidency showed towards the european parliament by UNK the start of the intergovernmental conference for saint valentine ' s day , the first day of the strasbourg part - session .    2.8064717587067984
moreover , given that this opinion is quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be voting for it .    3.761542038389047
i nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform .    3.74379348026905
we must take action on this at the intergovernmental conference , and i firmly hope that this opinion , that was given reluctantly , will not mean that the european parliament UNK to exert pressure on the council and the member states to make sure that this intergovernmental conference is not merely a technical exercise , but UNK the UNK that we saw a few hours ago in parliament .    3.7153461307833417
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , to my mind , it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the intergovernmental conference is completely unacceptable politically and i would add that i consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful .    2.917527314595744
how , though , is the union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now , i . e . before enlargement takes place ?    3.2740670500861424
that is why we as a group are in favour of the intergovernmental conference .    2.835624533559976
we consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the european union in the not too distant future .    2.90818555324436
my group , mr president - in - office of the council , noted with satisfaction that the council presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs .    2.8431300117957425
you can therefore rest assured that the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left is committed to seeing that the union gets on with the tasks in hand .    2.2422885638371635
what we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of europe , and , in particular , a europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs , because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the UNK and concerns , the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians .    2.907773079307845
the politics of closed doors and private discussions ; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all .    2.20681949978802
that is why we need transparency .    2.561646304385432
i believe it falls to you , as president - in - office of the council , to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before , leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were UNK as to the content of the treaties .    2.5169201034009068
we believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the intergovernmental conference is going , and its outcome , rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent .    2.8495693380318716
we also take the view that the political decision - makers must at long last change the habit of a life - time and ask the citizens in referenda , once the intergovernmental conference is over , whether or not they go along with the way in which europe is to continue to develop in the future .    3.009123855424043
in this way , europe would truly belong to the citizens and the union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy .    2.608259636927111
there is another central issue relating to democracy that i would like to make clear reference to .    2.8065103951689725
as a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the charter of fundamental rights , i wish to make the following point clear : neither my group nor i are content with making a solemn announcement about the charter .    2.677304042152189
no , to my mind this would only serve to UNK the credibility crisis facing the union .    2.77729363791763
the poor turnout at the european elections really should have been warning enough for everyone .    2.670805425190683
what we need are visible rights for each and every citizen ; the charter of fundamental rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the union .    2.5941613389055633
together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens , and what i expect to come out of the intergovernmental conference is that the relevant cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year .    3.5092855651903627
of course , we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a union of 27 plus member states .    2.5103087044301424
we will not achieve this just by undertaking a UNK reform , as the council has resolved to do , and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny .    3.1413472156955717
we need bold change and , at the same time , we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small states .    2.841142180308501
this is something i would stress , particularly with my being an mep for one of the major member states .    3.1129368421597405
i would like to thank the commission for the proposals they have put forward and i am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will UNK here in the european parliament , on all the issues you have raised .    3.088584388857233
there is one final issue i would like to raise .    3.0025587627765624
parliament ' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the treaty in the area of economic policy .    3.440494961928566
it is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies , but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision - making processes .    2.8761920277013306
what we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the union ' s policies to date .    3.2213415224345625
it is all about creating a socially just europe .    2.454272752362742
a socially just europe is still highly topical , for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the union ' s policies .    2.9634596072196717
hence , to my mind , that includes having the courage to amend article 4 of the ec treaty , which defines the union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition . the same applies to article 105 , in my view , for the european central bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the treaty , of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment .    2.711546146818817
mr president , the union for a europe of nations group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , as set by the helsinki council , i . e . UNK strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged europe , must be adhered to .    3.0428014979358804
it must be adhered to in the interests of the fast , effective work of the conference , prior to enlargement .    3.0349803885579067
this is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the european parliament or indeed to that of the commission , which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and , what is more , widen it in the wrong direction , i . e . moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter european system .    2.6852055370087404
our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which , when taken together , form a real alternative resolution .    2.397952404849129
in them we say that the forthcoming igc must look into a decision - making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty .    2.8783094564436724
we deplore the fact that the commission , in its opinion of 26 january , limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised europe enlarging towards the east , a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions .    2.516281182957116
the federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint , but this is a totally superficial concept .    2.855362545050866
quite the opposite , in an enlarged europe , mr president , the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing UNK .    2.9540315343439554
furthermore , the centralised european system , as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by UNK , erodes nations and , in eroding nations , erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves .    2.750019522988703
the europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker , as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending .    2.937638038570443
we are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles , one which are still , unfortunately , outside the european parliament and the commission .    3.0198817025644016
it is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats , not the UNK , convoluted decision making procedures which the commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference .    2.508671939913912
mr president , i am speaking on behalf of the italian radicals and i would like to say to the president of the council that he has seen what parliament ' s opinion is .    3.472079911474952
it is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further european integration . i say this without being the slightest bit UNK about the highly respectable position of mr berthu and his group , but it is no coincidence that the european council ' s decision is supported by those who are , after all , in parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration .    2.968388008842417
this is the message that parliament is sending to the council .    3.071557836185343
i hope that the portuguese presidency - and i add my compliments to those already offered - can convey parliament ' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on saint valentine ' s day . in any case , tomorrow we shall vote against the igc agenda .    2.775178444158548
this message must be very clear ; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow .    3.0402787945991347
we shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the igc on 14 february , but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content .    2.553178632139441
just consider the facts : we looked at austria a while ago , but we can also look at the stock markets , mr president : given that the euro , that great undertaking , has fallen 16 % against the dollar in a year , then perhaps , i will not say a government , but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of commissioners or similar issues .    2.6575472144212298
we radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the house in order to consolidate this text , and for example , to request - just for the sake of mentioning articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done , i . e . , that the european parliament should also be involved in drawing up the european constitution and that a proposal be made for the european parliament to adopt the amendments to the treaty .    3.6768843799654314
we know that there are other topics : for example , many members have UNK , along with us , to the issue of the seat of the institutions , an issue that we believe should be considered at least at igc level .    3.520369529570447
in conclusion , i hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide - ranging for once , so that thanks also to the efforts of the portuguese presidency , this agenda will be revised .    3.182878352355377
otherwise , the challenge really would be lost , not just for the present but also for many years to come .    3.237753190106866
mr president , the president of the commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the intergovernmental conference .    2.476719279084252
he said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but , in the commission ' s draft , plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision - making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market . this means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the member states to be changed by a majority in brussels , even if a unanimous french national assembly , a british house of commons and a dutch lower house should be against this .    3.0148053545963913
and , in this regard , you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people ' s social conditions , which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls .    3.194983437924461
these are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day .    3.0129426918965074
brussels knows best .    2.919100615451054
mr prodi also announced greater transparency , but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step , and that is not only my assessment , but also that of the european ombudsman .    3.206364875739614
today , the commission is obliged , on a case - by - case basis , to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people ' s demands for , and expectation of , transparency and , if the commission ' s regulation is adopted , the commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration .    3.087519196014154
there is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of member states .    2.6496001404299565
under the banner of " progress towards transparency " , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public .    2.5799422058683867
it is , of course , thoroughly UNK .    2.6122351374590185
i want to ask mr prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the house which is not , at the same time , available for critical scrutiny by the public .    3.1621092237698813
mr prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism , for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the commission ' s possession . there follows , however , a long , long list of exceptions , and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions .    2.74409148184377
the french text contains the word " refuse " and the english text the word " shall " , which means that the commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public , for example in my own country .    2.7423804770994114
in addition , we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions , which may be used for any purposes whatsoever . it is therefore .    3.8532341892636714
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.799445241956104
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the portuguese council presidency ' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this intergovernmental conference with well - considered ideas and a high degree of openness .    2.357582694479015
we as a european parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve .    2.8794964471545628
the preparations the commission has made so far are on the right track , although they do not go far enough if the european parliament ' s motions are anything to go by .    3.23268544006804
there is more to be said on that score .    2.960360937168628
it is crucially important for this intergovernmental conference to score a hat UNK ; that of the power to act , democratic legitimacy and transparency .    2.7634490808750476
if we have been having a different debate here in this chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is .    2.6204646978306907
the european union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade .    2.8683800877270915
this is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre - requisite to the european union ' s being able to function come what may .    2.715839439991021
this is particularly important where enlargement is concerned , and legislation and in relation to treaties , which entail changes being made to legislation .    2.8284213142297245
of course we also want to extend the european parliament ' s corresponding powers in this area .    3.411042541957905
in addition , we as a european parliament are going to have to take action in relation to economic and monetary union , for there is a lack of supervision in this area .    3.8116643977447286
the finance ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting , when in the ecofin council and in the euro 11 council , which is an unacceptable way to go on .    3.052497551842338
unlike mrs UNK , i am not in favour of extending supervision over the european central bank as i am an advocate of independence for the european central bank .    3.401116792836514
however , there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side .    2.845033192815949
furthermore , the tripartite relationship of commission , council and parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy , where hitherto the council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case , especially in relation to the UNK fashioned crisis management measures , for which the commission alone has responsibility .    2.7932481415934842
the overall plan failed to do justice to any of this .    2.5081884931760543
we must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the intergovernmental conference .    2.5497553615407047
the portuguese presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter , perhaps to extend the mandate .    2.932844401554716
the debates we are having these days , on a certain european country ' s government , for example , show , do they not , that we must place the spiritual , moral , constitutional , community and common welfare - orientated UNK of the european union on a firm footing , and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the treaty for the same reason , as this will be a crucial stabilising factor .    3.1917480397348434
i would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps UNK up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights .    3.1639091025490007
the european union needs few , if any , new instruments , and it does not need any new competences .    3.1097223163489476
what it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice .    2.379404236288409
for this reason , we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out , on behalf of the citizens , the tasks we have already formally been set in the treaty .    3.366741058113987
in my view , that is the most important issue this intergovernmental conference has to concentrate its energies on .    3.339882167158762
if we succeed in making progress here , then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the european union .    2.666895681539236
this is the crux of the matter .    2.3943729561846365
mr president - in - office of the council , i am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your UNK .    2.430622500101335
, chairman of the committee on constitutional affairs . ( it ) mr president - in - office , on listening to the various interventions , you have understood that in the committee on constitutional affairs and also among the leaders of parliament ' s political groups , the decision UNK - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the portuguese presidency , instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the intergovernmental conference .    2.8587814937827583
i can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this , last week in the committee i chair , but we eventually decided to back the portuguese presidency and we would like to win this wager .    3.48737572099798
you spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries , and therefore in their parliaments .    2.6846952150908012
i would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments , which were represented by competent and UNK delegations .    2.7346587410664385
the aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging .    2.545479804350932
we need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the union ' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the intergovernmental conference table .    2.587431026505322
however , we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the intergovernmental conference .    2.6515868170978143
yesterday , we also discussed the commission , represented by commissioner barnier , who gave its opinion .    3.160961986188536
this effort was appreciated , even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals , and moreover , mr president - in - office , you also expressed different views .    2.5569638375504837
nevertheless , we must stress that many people are aware , as they were yesterday too , of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political europe , a risk that was , moreover , indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one ' s attention , owing to the authority of the person being UNK - jacques delors .    2.848763303542951
we must , therefore , ensure that at the intergovernmental conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the house even today , with regard to the situation in austria - the system of principles , values and rights underpinning the union and the role of the political institutions of the union , with regard , among other things , to running the economy .    3.4830257876511386
we are counting on the portuguese presidency , we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the intergovernmental conference .    3.3270009355481034
mr president , only a strengthened europe can cope with enlargement .    2.2001779552063576
only a strengthened europe is UNK to political UNK who exploit dissatisfaction .    2.6688601426848306
that is why sweeping reforms are necessary and , hence , a widened igc agenda .    2.1882847694048113
the finnish presidency only listened to minimalist governments and , unfortunately , turned a deaf ear to this parliament .    2.4475806771516044
portugal should not take a UNK out its predecessor ' s book .    2.5349507467855936
it is of the utmost importance that the european parliament and the commission join forces for this igc .    3.0564644779040586
in many ways , they share the same interests and the same insights .    2.8171746537390394
an essential component of this joint effort should , in any case , be this parliament ' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the treaty .    3.0099725877037757
of all priorities , this one is the most pressing .    3.1919265142397046
what is the commission ' s verdict on this ?    3.2735616991679772
it also means that our parliament president and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and , therefore , not only within the working party , but also at the same political level as the commission .    3.4616823079094616
there is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the commission .    2.1581775947606503
not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new member states , but we owe them to ourselves .    3.088943169193526
if we allow europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement , we will UNK in our own political UNK .    3.525517543363156
after having restricted , on its own initiative , its participation in the igc to two minor seats , parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this igc .    2.8550139545466924
the fact is , whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way , you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion , parliament is giving up the only lever which the treaty accords it , i . e . demanding a complete igc agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion .    2.15959607253831
why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow , 3 february , as a matter of urgency , when we could wait , in a position of strength , until the opening of the strasbourg part - session on 14 february , and thus force an agenda that is complete , and therefore consistent , on the council .    3.1522047096932178
a good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today .    2.3474257877502738
hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly , in our resolution , that the agenda for the igc is not equal to the issues , since in our haste , with UNK naivety , we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda .    2.8421932348434136
if there is a democratic deficit at the end of this igc , then i say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this .    3.135452321207478
whether we want it or not , since parliament itself is going to UNK the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates , the UNK for decisions is now going to move to the 15 member states of the union .    2.819655143020921
i therefore invite the members of parliament who form the great majority , those who last november ruled that the future of europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the amsterdam leftovers , to take up their UNK ' UNK and go and convince their own governments that this igc must be extended , since this is permitted according to the resolution of the helsinki council .    2.5442757686322577
because of the situation in austria , this is a dark day for europe .    4.328733671016
it makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive , and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing .    3.010343796520675
in order to assert our fundamental values , they need to be laid down in writing , as a matter of urgency , and , beyond this igc , i believe we owe europe a constitution .    3.246217582639586
mr president , the draft resolution we are now discussing requires , precisely as before , that the forthcoming intergovernmental conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions .    3.022745387330336
the forthcoming enlargement of the union is used as an argument for this .    3.3164823409017963
i am convinced that this is an error of judgement .    3.140304523376951
a federal and centralist eu which UNK more and more in the government of the member states is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement .    2.8154360780595638
a flexible eu which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries .    1.9796405872401306
paragraph d of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at eu level .    2.447601035860124
this text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the european central bank . this is UNK .    3.1453919609572454
if there is a desire to make the eu more democratic , the whole construction of emu must be reconsidered .    2.8383989705791532
the central bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity . public control of the central bank must be improved if this is to become possible .    2.7862250458476843
article 56 of the treaty , prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital , must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control .    2.5621012361983198
in the majority of eu countries , there are now governments dominated by social democrats .    3.2854073703527957
it is remarkable that , now they have the opportunity to do so , none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union .    2.819099461115523
it also , of course , damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a UNK to globalised capital .    2.6554544849097748
the resolution requires the european parliament to have increased influence over the intergovernmental conference .    3.2594944309639975
it is , however , important to emphasise that the intergovernmental conference is and will remain a conference of the member states .    2.9997292718680115
it is the member states ' parliaments , or people voting in referenda , who are to direct the development of the treaty .    3.0525256901573496
it is therefore out of the question that the european parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification .    2.819926448949857
mr president , the committee on constitutional affairs has proposed an essentially positive text , which i shall vote for , even if i personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it .    2.728866074037933
the union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether europe has certain joint principles and values , whether it comes down to an economic free trade area , or whether , on the other hand , it has a greater ambition : the desire to be a supranational union , in ways that have yet to be defined , that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world .    2.552209324082133
this is what is and was meant by the call for a european constitution .    2.9671005352207773
the amendment of the treaties was , however , limited to a review of some internal rules , which was necessary and important , but did not answer the fundamental question : what is europe , what are its common principles and therefore , its objectives and limitations ?    2.9017714086617077
however , politics UNK its revenge , and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda , it comes back in , as a matter of fact , through a door , and through the front door in the case of austria , since a party is entering the austrian government which seems to represent a return to intolerance , xenophobia and forms of racism .    2.5665582248826704
and it is not a question of links with the past ; it is a question of prospects for the future , and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this .    3.2376347328704456
i belong to a world , the world of liberal catholics , which is not left - wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common european values , and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values .    2.6318919785536896
the council has done well to lay open this subject to europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a charter of fundamental rights , in a european constitution , then we shall construct a europe without a solid , lasting base .    3.134171102356989
commissioner barnier , i know - at least i think i know - that you and the representatives of the portuguese presidency share these values : make the most of the chances you were given by the december conference to include these subjects and principles , because this is the only way we will build a lasting europe .    2.861927257706268
they rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles .    2.4344439686006636
i might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country , denmark , takes it for granted that , when we enlarge the circle of eu countries to include the envisaged huge number of new member states and when we in that way extend the breadth of the union , we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth , that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a united states of europe .    2.9016522304278807
however , that is precisely what is happening .    3.8349822015799107
with every single geographical extension to the area covered by the eu , we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth , and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the committee is contemplating , especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth .    2.9319484218085874
you can think what you like about mr haider , and i personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician , but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country ' s democratic process .    2.906269839287955
when we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the treaty , we must take into account the fact that the eu is developing all the time , sometimes in contravention of the treaty , as we have just seen .    3.6939807178885307
i welcome commissioner barnier and the portuguese presidency here this afternoon .    3.0959911689132285
on 14 february , we will see the launch of the igc which is to be completed by the end of 2000 .    3.6146955924484323
this is a big task but it can be done .    2.907642820829035
i think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare europe for enlargement .    2.270715156640415
these include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re - weighting of voting in council to favour larger states and the number of commissioners in an enlarged europe .    2.574969076920134
in relation to the latter point , ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal member of the commission irrespective of the number of member states joining .    3.436195005915151
i feel i speak for many smaller countries when i make that particular point .    2.1646945043724943
we would accept the division of the treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller member states had in the re - negotiation of the whole policy area of the treaty .    2.953858904529659
so we are watching that entire point extremely carefully .    2.262577844163042
we look forward to the charter of fundamental rights and to seeing its contents .    2.5991319078268913
the treaty of amsterdam , mr president , has set the number of european parliament members at 700 and a debate is needed in this parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged europe .    2.985765408502926
mr president , i warmly recommend a vote in favour of the dimitrakopoulos / leinen resolution , which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the UNK of the agenda and our wish that the intergovernmental conference should take place as soon as possible .    2.7509303048964604
in any case , this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon .    2.200144978368904
i think that , under the present rules of the treaties , the european parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation .    3.50923439459121
on the contrary , we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms , in collaboration with the commission whose own proposals are worthy of note .    2.5488617153680333
we must use dialogue at every political level , including of course dialogue with the national parliaments .    2.487142244818809
that way , we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms .    3.62151128858923
parliament ' s representatives at the intergovernmental conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that , with the union ' s institutional changes , we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the union .    3.5398513196707273
they must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone .    2.328426174648712
the issues to be dealt with at this intergovernmental conference are exceptionally sensitive .    2.8760642371983876
it may be easy to come up with solutions , but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term .    2.5722297013253814
i will mention two point that may create tension .    2.266543078905799
one is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries .    2.583192133689538
the solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the european union , which is a union of states and peoples .    3.2361676190551028
the other area of conflict is more difficult .    2.436020136409426
owing to the imminent increase in membership , the bodies of the future european union must become more effective .    3.0589940911029823
this means that they must function more simply and more rapidly .    2.3248730348243423
by its very nature , however , the european union is , and will remain , a complex and convoluted multi - governmental institution .    3.1743296812197808
possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist .    2.3616952450481703
of course they do , but they are not UNK .    3.2036019920779126
if the limits are exceeded because of a one - sided quest for effectiveness , then the legitimising basis of the european union will suffer .    2.8385656113655227
i am , however , optimistic .    3.7042242217063075
mr president , the intergovernmental conference mandate needs to be widened .    3.135859759548095
the most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the union .    3.1002170026459397
it is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the union , which will , however , be necessary if the union is to enlarge as planned .    3.413213877270815
the commission ' s former president , jacques delors , has once again publicly raised the issue of a european UNK .    2.8365689300098826
the commission ' s current president , mr prodi , and the high representative , mr solana , have put forward ideas along the same lines .    3.375707272306582
last november , the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for europe : the UNK UNK model .    2.6479759539571748
in the next resolution on the igc , parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility .    3.464892299015935
both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings , as proposed by the group of the european liberal democrats and reform party .    2.6736700292745854
my colleagues , mrs frassoni and mr onesta have already spoken , somewhat UNK , about some aspects of the matter in hand .    2.549118197367387
i wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between union and member states but between member states and their own internally self - governing regions .    2.966874448493009
this has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about .    3.0990173640675267
may i particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this parliament .    3.38553345413359
if you apply the existing principle of UNK proportionality , six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants , you already have the situation where luxembourg with UNK , 000 people has more members in this chamber than wales , which is a partly self - governing region of the united kingdom .    2.343903973605595
scotland , with a population of 5 million , has eight seats in this house at the moment ; denmark and finland , with the same population , have sixteen .    3.2001101750075303
now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700 , bring in 26 % more population over time , and then adopt the commission ' s , i think ill - considered , UNK , that there should be a european list of candidates .    3.0739851741117143
what will happen to a place like scotland , which i represent here ?    2.808633495250421
it will become totally invisible !    2.584016474795744
members of this house should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions , people in scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new member states from within existing ones .    2.599562269381235
a growing body of opinion in scotland holds that view .    2.3393477995568177
mr president , to say that the european union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new . it has been said many times .    3.6428777992231534
this time , however , it is true .    4.4205062250199605
the question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not .    2.6350352684719445
will we enlarge with or without deep reform ?    2.3858805713140545
that is the debate , and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the intergovernmental conference , its agenda or its method .    3.3309727816456625
it is clear that the council , for the moment , has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place .    3.263345459932757
that puts enlargement in danger . it jeopardises any prospect of political union and , of course , it is difficult for the public to understand .    2.920315181740714
the council must realise that , if we want the future of the european union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations , the next intergovernmental conference must go much further .    3.3247366517558934
the council is consulting us and parliament is giving its opinion .    2.8070794253969202
we want an intergovernmental conference , but not this one .    3.339360859878123
must there be an igc ?    2.7751629362492674
of course there must , but not this type of intergovernmental conference .    3.1134656779635757
the agenda must go much further . we must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the igc and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic .    3.528511327016395
being much more democratic means greater participation by the european parliament and allowing the commission to exercise even more - yes , more - its ability to take the initiative .    3.0355150681515255
we must clearly set firm objectives .    2.51558554358725
the functionalist approach is over , for better or for worse .    2.3351781229110196
the functionalist approach has brought us to this point .    2.362533776552191
have we achieved results ?    2.7494006330859135
yes , but the point is to make a qualitative leap and , speaking in political terms , this , mr president - in - office of the council , means convincing the other community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment .    2.65455590740253
mr president , ladies and gentlemen of the house , at this stage , following this debate which i have listened to most attentively and with great interest , i should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of president prodi .    2.913669642986416
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work , your two rapporteurs , mr dimitrakopoulos and mr leinen , proposed that parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to article 48 of the treaty and thus , if this opinion were adopted , the intergovernmental conference could effectively start on 14 february , as suggested by the portuguese presidency .    2.494212508953351
as far as we are concerned , after producing the opinion expected from the commission , according to this same article 48 of the treaty , we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated .    3.096212018699109
we know , i know myself , that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us .    3.2235881689874337
i would just like to make a few comments , after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups .    2.830371481728704
firstly , ladies and gentlemen , the commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda .    3.534771559335077
indeed , it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate , which the commission framed for its own opinion , but using all the terms thereof , plus everything between the lines .    2.947724890473629
we have not restricted ourselves to the three so - called leftovers , which is , in any case , an incorrect label .    3.395714660792092
i do not like the term ' leftovers ' any more than UNK corbett does .    2.3587987084781834
it gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects , and difficult , so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at amsterdam to deal with them in depth .    2.454629423406126
as far as we are concerned - i am responding to mr seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects , even though i do consider them as priorities , and consider that they must be dealt with now .    2.5922959151442413
they are the first but they are not the only subjects , mr seguro , that the conference must deal with .    3.5359400782457864
we are ready for it , whether it is a matter of the charter of fundamental rights , on which work has started , the cfsp and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations , or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work : reorganisation of the treaties .    3.168081097727696
i have heard many comments on the commission ' s opinion , which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth , with specific indications of new draft articles , but no one has said that we were going beyond the helsinki mandate .    2.80316855798636
this proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate , by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers .    2.640072972011211
as regards the participation of the european parliament in the conference proceedings , i think that mr seixas da costa will agree with me , on the basis of our shared experience , in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives , professor tsatsos and mr brok , are going to be working .    2.9822270610197807
of course , the final trade - offs will be made , as in any institutional negotiations , and i think this is no bad thing , at council level , especially at the level of the council of heads of state and government , who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands .    3.0357151930287913
let me point out , in passing , that the commission president , mr prodi , is also a council member , and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role , alongside the heads of state and government , particularly during the final period .    2.923179388890047
however , these council proceedings must be carefully prepared .    2.282658640164931
this preparatory work , this fine - UNK , must not be omitted , ladies and gentlemen of the house . i know from my own experience in amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful , and that it will not just be limited to technical details .    3.232247481776084
i think that all of us , the personal representatives of the ministers of foreign affairs , your two representatives , and myself , as a representative of the commission , will be going into matters in detail , but it will be afterwards , at a different level , one in which we will also be participating , that the last trade - offs must be made .    3.853548470316182
throughout this conference , ladies and gentlemen , it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important , but the quality of what they will be saying .    4.0562051659681275
and once again i should like to point out in this house , in view of my own experience prior to amsterdam , that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the european parliament , prior to amsterdam , the quality of what mrs UNK and mr brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations .    3.1954972472616348
i am sure that the situation will be just the same and , as far as i am concerned , in my current position , i shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations .    3.142065113945616
i am sure that in this way the european parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the commission will be .    3.973048978317645
we now await , therefore , with great interest , ladies and gentlemen of the house , your next opinion , in which you will specify parliament ' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations .    3.1801448298389343
it is extremely important that the two european institutions involved in these negotiations , the commission on the one hand and parliament on the other , alongside the council members , explain clearly to the citizens of the union continually , every day , what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as european institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged union and the common interest .    2.9530670696988217
in the coming months , ladies and gentlemen of the house , the commission will therefore be working in close cooperation , on good terms , with your two representatives , professor tsatsos and mr elmar brok , in order to reconcile our points of view , if need be .    2.910274885483984
quite probably , our points of view and our positions will not always be the same . there will probably be differences of opinion , that would be only normal .    2.6876530857277117
the important thing is that we are consistent , and i have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since i accepted the position of commissioner .    3.2835017652505534
this will not be a matter of chance , since , let me repeat , i feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the european union .    3.285520464345365
finally , i should like to make three additional comments , quite briefly , mr president .    2.638416116242781
firstly , to congratulate and thank mr napolitano , the chairman , and the committee on constitutional affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments , the committee on constitutional affairs and the commission for an initial joint debate .    2.7582224431467446
such dialogue between the national parliaments , the european parliament and ourselves is extremely important .    3.688472150555605
i have said , furthermore , that i would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments .    3.2879316442000355
tomorrow , i shall be in london .    3.3734351835320107
in a fortnight ' s time , i shall be in berlin .    3.1785924712318216
in three weeks ' time , i shall be in paris , and i shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another .    3.0421391911936158
i feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive , and i should like to thank you for taking it .    2.9819049868664353
my second brief comment is to thank the portuguese presidency , particularly mr seixas da costa , for his proactive approach .    2.99138808109554
indeed , the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own : the portuguese presidency cannot be just an interim presidency .    2.390527535860713
it will have to initiate these negotiations .    3.2232019874959814
we are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the french presidency , in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000 .    3.2180374468683213
not only that a conclusion can be reached , but that a successful conclusion can be reached , which is not necessarily the same thing .    3.182249782816438
concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully .    3.1904588209707385
the handover will have been made , but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made , by yourself , mr president , and by the portuguese presidency , are going to be extremely important , as is the nature of this handover .    4.332856654333414
it is all the work which is going to be carried out together , under your guidance particularly , in the course of these few months , which is extremely important .    3.582089799091495
we have great confidence in the portuguese presidency ' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion , and indeed great expectations thereof . portugal is a small country , but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions .    2.683081016442503
after having heard prime minister guterres , the minister of foreign affairs and yourself , i have confidence in the ambition of the portuguese presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations .    2.7641078797486203
it can count on the partnership of the commission over the next few months .    3.3046123133046863
finally , let me repeat , we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations .    3.2081818764193333
these are difficult subjects , subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain .    2.3234867549633327
all the more reason for members of the european parliament , ministers , commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens , to public debate .    2.922073010462621
as far as the commission is concerned , it will , ladies and gentlemen , be taking initiatives to UNK and UNK this public debate .    3.8063964604716123
cross - border services    3.841363885278615
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :    2.0795770254299333
a5 - 0007 / 2000 by mrs berger , on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , on a proposal for a european parliament and council directive on the posting of workers who are third - country nationals for the provision of cross - border services ( com ( 1999 ) 3 - c4 - 0095 / 1999 - 1999 / 0012 ( cod ) ;    2.219080745247435
a5 - 0012 / 2000 by mrs berger , on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , on a proposal for a council directive extending the freedom to provide cross - border services to third - country nationals established in the community ( com ( 1999 ) 3 - c4 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / 0013 ( cns ) .    2.256051563425631
- ( de ) mr president , commissioner , firstly i would like to apologise for being a little UNK today , but we austrian meps have had a lot of explaining and talking to do .    2.866547282363077
i would first like to say how indebted i am to the commission for UNK the initiative , and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today .    3.428879729384273
it has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the european economy and to 5 million third - country nationals in the european union who are here as workers or on a self - employed basis .    2.9320259290315267
the current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the european court of justice relating to employees , i refer in particular to those relating to the rush UNK case and that of van der UNK .    2.8590774527302947
these have , in fact , clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third - country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross - border services and this without having to obtain work permits .    2.69632591371656
however , the european court of justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the member states were unable to clarify this issue .    3.144827210684449
furthermore , not all member states have UNK by the court of justice ' s UNK with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement , and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross - border services ; barriers that are often impossible to overcome , especially for the smaller companies .    2.771374912873893
there is no doubt that we need a legislative act here .    3.137791226451496
both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for eu enterprises .    2.490821617783979
all provisions , i . e . issues relating to entry into the eu and to the law pertaining to residence rights , should be regarded as UNK to this freedom to provide services .    3.142005013808629
i , together with the european parliament ' s committee on legal affairs and the internal market , are therefore of the opinion that the commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view , as expressed in the report produced by the council ' s legal service , is inappropriate .    3.4855728348537407
consequently , i do not see that there is any real obstacle to the council ' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned .    3.3350528527898318
i also believe that parliament ' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the council to adopt the directives as opposed to the commission ' s proposal .    3.458783340112327
many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the council , and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by UNK of UNK law and economic good sense .    2.774429990045767
when it comes to acceptance by the council , i can only urge the commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by parliament as possible , even if some of them deviate substantially from the original commission proposals .    3.532090180408162
i am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the council on this basis .    3.4377896061565054
turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments , one of the essential differences is that , in place of a " service provision card plus notification for each individual contract " system , provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract .    2.823754415707287
this system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms .    2.6283518399248353
an individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection , not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter .    3.0614904465035258
this should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self - employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident .    2.494463992108955
likewise , the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued , namely under the terms of an opposition procedure .    2.6367517392109656
what we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the eu service provision card for all member states , rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual member states .    3.2335374114366715
i believe this system is also more suited to practical needs .    2.3542088369954084
i would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months , and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting .    2.8618860160355357
however , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months .    2.371034601917249
when it comes to self - employed persons , in addition to the amendments already described , we propose that the UNK criteria should be made more stringent , and that we should make provision for the possibility of UNK any abuse in the way of bogus self - employment .    3.2669817295413344
i would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .    2.7101529739818964
of course i would add that i continue to support this committee ' s amendments , which they adopted unanimously .    2.817267222235198
i have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting council decisions .    2.4156359548235096
i must say i have received extremely contradictory statements from parliament ' s services as to exactly how these council decisions should be quoted ; whether or not one should use the number or date alone , or both , and how extensively to quote from them .    2.3032201411193713
two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report .    2.2573874584614253
i withdraw the two other amendments - that is amendment no 18 to the report on self - employed persons and amendment no 21 on employed persons .    2.595087631619817
i can only urge the conference of presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology , i . e . the correct way to quote .    2.731212499898071
this would make our rapporteur ' s life considerably easier in the future .    2.770840496652189
unfortunately i have to say that i am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the committee on legal affairs and the internal market resolved on unanimously , and i would like to stand by this outcome , which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions .    2.8198738268585313
on a final note , i would like to thank all those in the committee who supported me in compiling these reports , which were far from easy to produce .    2.79007143321656
i would like to single mr wieland out for special mention , for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report , contributing excellent and constructive ideas ; and this without being in a position to receive the UNK awarded a rapporteur .    2.153706393907196
that is why he deserves special mention !    2.365143729725723
.    2.489189446364389
( nl ) mr president , i am pleased i have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur mrs berger ' s speech , after which i will , of course , listen with all due attention to the next speakers . if you allow me , mr president , i would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate .    3.2508956949086008
may i say how the commission welcomes the european parliament ' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third - country employees , the topic of the debate .    3.35525544284627
i am extremely grateful for the work that mrs berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge .    2.517021560901643
the commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards .    2.826279302837717
if the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more , or all , member states , the procedure would be more flexible still .    2.7009918041793264
the commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card .    2.3257038368691196
the commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is UNK at short notice .    2.3196646430549253
an efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross - border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market .    2.4264786768871365
it seems over the top to us for other member states to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards .    2.706770363987275
indeed , it should be possible for a third - country subject who has legal status in a member state to be admitted to other member states too .    2.8155327423070022
that does not prevent these member states from taking public - order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification .    2.7574777923041798
neither does the commission accept the proposal that legal status in a member state should be valid three months after the card has expired .    2.678419810708842
following completion of the service , it is not acceptable for the third - country subject in question to remain any longer in the member state in which the service is provided .    3.43266352129035
that is why the commission supports mrs palacio ' s amendment no 22 in both respects .    2.6847694954840415
as far as the second proposal is concerned , the commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self - employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal .    2.899779597143968
these are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments .    2.456230388200691
i hope that , at the end of the debate , when all the speakers have contributed , i will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments .    3.288817150316802
mr president , tomorrow will see a large majority within the ppe group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , as well as the amended version .    2.6072829474972603
i propose to confine my comments to two areas .    2.471186873015893
firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve , that is achieve in the real sense .    3.1845374212838173
there is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account .    4.8075658779638095
my comments start from the premise that we are talking about an UNK individual in UNK employment .    2.680078884600933
then there are the interests of the member states , which , being on the receiving end , may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario .    3.1599511582025186
if we are going to abide by the one extreme , that is the interests of the member states , then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high .    3.2652596736249517
there is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card .    2.811312773839767
if i were to go to the other extreme , as few hurdles as possible that is , then i would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the member states would not sign up to this directive .    2.817997757190961
i would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place , but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high , in reality no one would apply for the card . alternatively , i might have no directive at all .    2.7328461756674045
neither outcome would be satisfactory .    2.6180605941168
perhaps this is also why , as is UNK to be the case , the council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well .    3.8279939465699644
we have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of finding the easiest possible solution .    2.8589620537433205
we want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis - à - vis the business world , but once these have been overcome , implementation is as easy as it possibly could be .    2.088890553427052
therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more member states .    2.3411037288011407
if a company in france says that it has an employee who has to work in denmark on a permanent basis , and only in denmark , then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for denmark .    2.8766636025051255
accordingly , the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance .    2.5412495351634994
in return for this , however , we want early notification obligations to be discontinued , rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other member state along with them , and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his / her posting .    3.010939594637891
consequently , i too have to say that i am in favour of the amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .    2.892473231482383
perhaps there was a certain amount of UNK misunderstanding on the part of the commission .    2.9085460359640947
we want to achieve a completely flexible solution .    3.0623998828718424
if a particular member state was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country , then this particular member state would be able to UNK this card , as it were , for the reasons cited in this directive , which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution .    2.629113644534052
allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter .    2.341438152670838
most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers .    3.0251297040908174
we all know that there are still various parts of the treaty , some of them very old , which are still referred to as ec .    3.5997334190373818
we are aware that this directive is founded on ec law and not on eu law .    2.7330565407177847
however , before the elections we - the council , the commission , parliament , the press , unions and companies that is - worked towards making the europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens .    3.0713004893577844
we have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from eec to ec to eu .    2.393605068757327
they have now got to grips with " eu " .    2.393444932117327
we would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to UNK the product we are proposing to deliver " ec service provision card " and not " eu service provision card " .    2.403181443076886
it is the world of the eu that the citizens are interested in , this is the one that counts in their eyes .    3.672643204303569
i would urge the council and the commission to move in this direction .    3.1137790899862665
one of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism .    2.4553085121465728
this directive is , of course , not in itself directly about that .    3.1402755724011966
it is about attending to the needs of the internal market , creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self - employed .    2.3405237023626553
that is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger .    2.122721704692257
we welcome that , and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision , we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law .    2.670109997305183
mr president , commissioner , i would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by mrs berger and the committee on legal affairs and the internal market generally , which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive , which i hope will be approved by the commission and the council .    2.9357198008407415
nevertheless , i have tabled an amendment .    2.9039033909879524
mrs berger , in your amendment no 2 to recital 6 , you mention legal security .    2.6186070928412057
the first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the UNK permit , since all that does is create legal insecurity .    2.4046662469207463
you rightly raise the concern , also expressed by mr wieland , at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire , but i think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit .    2.5209423178745243
if the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date , it must end on that date .    2.5644806960695123
legal security requires this .    2.775250234406584
on the other hand , with regard to point d of amendment no 10 , which refers to the first directive , you suggest that , for reasons of public security or public order regulations , a member state may reject the validity of the card .    2.7242739110430017
there are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive .    2.5586305308209765
it makes no sense for any worker within the schengen area , since he or she will already have undergone a UNK process in order to enter the first member state , and the second member state would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory .    2.378434633151515
it therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity .    2.6135773790909798
in the case of a non - schengen state , in the last paragraph of amendment no 22 , that possibility is UNK , and is perfectly expressed , and i believe this provides greater legal security .    3.3855253273485637
the UNK power of the state , which you propose in point e of your amendment no 10 , seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report .    2.6535250816028775
i would therefore ask members to examine my amendment carefully , and i hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result .    2.6991202990077117
on the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across europe and to give effect to the recent court cases mrs berger referred to in her opening remarks .    2.399845488320368
however , in the case of the united kingdom , we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable .    3.180126283289644
partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the united kingdom .    3.6243857452155974
under the arrangements contained in the treaties , the united kingdom retains its border controls .    3.208054646907971
under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation , third country nationals wishing to move to the uk under the procedures described , will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another member state , thereby by - passing uk border controls .    2.35174859418173
if there is to be a change to the present united kingdom border arrangements , that change should be made by the united kingdom government and the united kingdom parliament and not en UNK by the european legislative process .    3.7850928709592084
for that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals .    2.9077765025162723
mr president , commissioner , first and foremost i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to mr wieland for the efforts they have UNK in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner .    2.642936815920196
these two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services .    3.297023711396364
the new regulation for cross - border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises .    2.637324799514003
the strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the eu service provision card - and i am with mr wieland on this - are essential , for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts .    2.9396398721590686
why do i think we need the directive so much ?    3.1815398274673083
three reasons and they are as follows : on account of the economic importance of third - country workers in the eu , in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market .    3.5545124688827685
therefore , whilst i welcome the strict basic conditions , i would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the member states to be made as effective and simple as possible .    3.7390982982963794
my last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the commission . will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations ?    2.5715603445725725
how is article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view , as this will have important implications , notably for the accession negotiations and for our country , which shares common borders with so many applicant countries ?    2.565326798415696
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms , namely the free movement of people and services , did not apply to them .    2.768809515179966
indeed , they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the member states where a service had to be provided .    2.787652734727332
there are approximately thirteen million third - country subjects who reside within european territory .    2.2323604788332325
i assume that , although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known , their number will most definitely not be low .    2.3407092286860935
so , up to now , their access to the entire territory of the union has not been regulated by community legislation .    3.4348222273643234
the aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the eu service provision card .    3.4190264761860534
i have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the commissioner .    3.195113694217729
having also studied the amendments submitted , i concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow .    2.8241857857150983
may i , to finish off , thank mrs berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having , in that way , added an important degree of meaning to her report ?    2.192941876294411
i think that , with this report , we are , once again , one step closer to the realisation of the internal market .    3.6123476501251273
mr president , thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail .    2.364904991218707
in the course of my speech , i would also like to address lord inglewood regarding the remark he has just made .    2.8937930659013116
regarding the first proposal on third - country employees , the commission is prepared to adopt amendments nos 2 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 and 22 .    2.8425912041536945
amendments nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too , provided the situation of posting is established in the member state in which the service provider is established .    2.906228817870317
the commission also agrees with amendment no 11 , except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months , as i explained just now .    2.3781305859413946
we also welcome amendment no 13 insofar as , as a result of this , the card ' s area of applicability is extended from one member state to all member states .    2.524436785931583
in terms of comitology , amendments nos 14 and 21 also apply in part , insofar as the rights of parliament are concerned .    2.695456641170807
in this respect , the commission supports amendment no 22 , as i have already mentioned .    3.2605924816059377
the other amendments are unacceptable .    2.9413410552753723
personally , i am rather in favour of the term " eu service provision card " which is proposed in amendment no 1 , but the treaty of amsterdam does not allow this .    3.2136698021735333
as amendment no 18 refers to directive 96 / 71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force , no change is necessary .    2.4387874142668102
acceptance of amendment no 17 by the commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued .    2.6705423641286554
surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the member states .    2.493434286026182
amendment no 19 is also unacceptable , given my thoughts on amendment no 10 .    2.460984562602115
the commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal .    3.0450519180887694
i would like to add that amendment no 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable .    2.538302175502856
as far as amendment no 15 on the definition of the term " self - employed " is concerned , the commission will , as i have already remarked , provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged .    2.885068715635953
i would now like to move on to lord inglewood ' s remark .    2.2432500989381596
he referred to united kingdom border controls and i would like to say to him that member states , and this includes the united kingdom , are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders .    2.8504705040570832
this applies , as already stated , to the united kingdom and it also applies to belgium , where it was recently of relevance .    3.1808445037355324
with regard to the remark made by mr karas , i am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from poland being used as employees in his country .    3.0163800927651128
the commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the european union which employ staff from non - eu countries .    3.006914423861493
the question is , furthermore , one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way .    2.7938830667715053
in my opinion , this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the european union and perhaps not to the present debate .    3.5885673964489095
on behalf of the commission , i would be more than happy to make myself available to mr karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point .    2.8181692367024476
i will keep myself free in this connection .    2.5737935043267894
finally , i would like to thank parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and , in particular , of course , the rapporteur , mrs berger .    3.5476258205475886
thank you very much , commissioner bolkestein .    2.3967241257915384
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 00 a . m .    1.911865735662369
court of first instance    4.009377039655797
mr president , i would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report , which , on reading it , gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the council ' s draft decision .    2.7705780341444437
however , this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results , such as the incorporation into the finnish presidency ' s document of 7 december 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the intergovernmental conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation , composition and competences of the community courts .    2.962751293618691
for this reason , i would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by vice - president marinho .    2.942455204422622
mr president , the reform of the community judicial system has become an essential requirement if , in the future , we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales , and if , in the future , the european union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon .    3.5638253862248743
today - and i must say this with pride and satisfaction - this parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we europeans believe that the european political project is much more than just an internal market , and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests .    3.5651200324125183
behind these principles , mr president , lies the justice system .    3.565174589589245
however , justice delayed is justice denied , and we must reflect on this notion .    2.8161081471137948
the working document prepared by the court itself contains alarming information .    2.531867051649556
for this reason , the draft reform , which has been drawn up by the rapporteur , vice - president marinho , is to be welcomed .    3.592852547697197
it is true that it is a stopgap solution , but we must rely on stopgap solutions because , at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the intergovernmental conference .    2.926595105307136
we have to offer solutions which , while provisional , help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice .    2.5991603233013696
i would like to make two observations during this intervention , which stem from the report itself , given this parliament ' s obligation , in accordance with the treaty , to produce a very UNK report , which does not go into depth .    3.2689275427508027
these are two of vice - president marinho ' s ideas and , i believe , they are UNK by the whole of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .    3.0503222751239907
the first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance , and that they should be given one more UNK .    3.278808685724727
the second is that the translation services of the court of first instance and the court of justice should be separated .    3.1117479352006936
at the moment , the court of first instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated .    2.5099461055311756
according to the treaty , one of the founding principles of this community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our UNK the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language .    3.2295219567366225
since we are talking about the intergovernmental conference , let us consider just two points .    3.566586009975247
the first concerns this parliament .    2.5437493812086562
i believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the court of justice , even in the appointment of judges .    3.3000194269703056
above all , we wish to see an extension of the competences of the court of justice , hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations , in other words , its resources .    3.0329242833312877
we wish to see its competences extended , especially within chapter iv of the treaty of the european community and with regard to chapter vi of the treaty on european union and also a review of certain possible options , certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens .    3.0730604249015996
and i refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days .    3.305397604493952
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report .    2.474785758467165
it has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency .    2.6924323692942433
both concern cases with decisions pending before the court of justice .    2.577586748372648
the first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not UNK on it should be subject to vat .    2.9870351444645964
the decision could have huge implications for our local economy .    2.297908413836163
secondly there is a UNK within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age .    2.2077478776850734
these are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in europe ' s system of justice . delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy .    2.2249128310917374
this is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect , but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the european court .    3.392587269039971
amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references .    3.009692870318324
this should not be taken as a criticism of the court or of its staff , rather of the court ' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing european union .    2.928100873093757
the proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim UNK , but europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning .    2.590038992964547
in the face of coming enlargement the igc must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system .    2.5585061088283796
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report .    2.297981396469074
i also fully endorse his findings , in which , in particular , he suggests increasing the number of UNK for judges at the court of first instance and providing the latter with its own translation service .    2.895820816580653
in point of fact , i consider this to be necessary because we heard , following the committee on legal affairs and the internal market ' s visit to luxembourg , that it is of course inevitable , a god - given fact as it were , that the court of justice should take precedence over the court of first instance when it comes to using the joint translation service , and so more often than not , important cases handled by the court of first instance cannot be given the attention they deserve .    2.6925612414447397
however i also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here .    3.445754620313237
for example , i believe it is worth considering making the court of first instance that of last instance , if applicable , and making this a final competence , in those spheres where benches of the court , which resemble courts , pass judgement at a preliminary stage - i need only mention the UNK alicante or whatever the plans are for european civil service law .    2.167222048899113
i am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the european commission ' s inclination to UNK competition decisions and transfer them back to national level .    3.1403241104830295
it seems to me that we need to give this some thought , as these cases will no longer fall to the court of first instance of course but to the court of justice as draft decisions .    2.9196278860523575
we need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind .    2.5906373508349976
in addition , we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which meps , not to mention groups , lodged a complaint against the european parliament - for the court of first instance to be responsible for such cases , when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the court of justice than before the court of first instance .    2.8209411604620795
as things stand , olaf is in a vacuum and can do as it UNK .    2.595000153411737
it is essential for olaf to be monitored by a court .    2.590130978064665
the only court that could reasonably do so would be the court of first instance .    2.52410599722797
that would be another way of UNK the reform process on .    3.140487362963409
mr president , i would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work .    2.2738828046179336
the european union is a system based on law .    2.5864119003342605
it must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law .    2.8749286898502353
furthermore , if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them , what happens , as madame palacio vallelersundi has already pointed out , is that justice delayed becomes , as we know , justice denied .    2.4769127447072505
the evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem .    2.7940128634205093
however , as mr marinho has pointed out , more is necessary , but that has to wait for the igc ,    3.85426028589184
in my own country , UNK tells of the teeming UNK of UNK brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of european judges .    2.425412552205158
there are less than three dozen at the UNK of the european judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the european legal system .    2.9505033165842827
the extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding anglo / french dispute over british beef which has caused such UNK in my country and such frustration with the workings of the union ' s disputes resolution procedures .    2.482485748753814
certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible .    2.436947273426552
this contrasts most UNK with the united kingdom courts where spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the united kingdom government in circumstances which were very comparable .    2.629827457356043
what is happening in france , mr president , appears UNK UNK to be a case of discrimination against other eu nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the treaties .    3.23209546687798
i would therefore like to ask the commissioner , who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to parliament and to me their findings .    2.7182835188408565
i would be grateful if the commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this .    2.2098331705106777
mr president , on behalf of commission president , mr prodi , i would like to respond as follows .    3.205820456843734
the commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the european parliament regarding the request made by the court of justice and the court of first instance . the UNK of this request is , on the one hand , to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the court of first instance , such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the court of justice and , on the other hand , to increase the number of judges at the court of first instance .    3.1101181148678694
may i add that , on behalf of the commission , i listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that i have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas .    3.1429473014790226
the unease is justified .    2.7372764010613233
it has been said more than once : justice delayed is justice denied .    2.2994170713578956
the commission UNK with these considerations .    2.8886564258933323
as your parliament is aware , the commission is convinced that , without fundamental reform , the community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines .    2.898142802198544
the commission is aware of the request made by the court of first instance to increase its number of judges , but at the moment , the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which i have just mentioned .    2.9767031769252568
in other words , once this study is complete , the commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible .    2.6097423264969333
thank you , commissioner .    2.120450226877885
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow .    1.8670405981068408
exceptional financial aid to kosovo    3.607346652007431
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0022 / 2000 ) by mr brok , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the proposal for a council decision providing exceptional community financial assistance to kosovo ( com ( 99 ) 0598 - c5 - 0045 / 00 - 1999 / 0240 ( cns ) .    1.9169019158166796
i have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes .    2.590553355757487
i propose that we start the debate immediately .    2.6726176732446585
he will join us and speak as soon as he arrives .    2.7955802400403544
i therefore give the floor immediately to mr bourlanges , in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on budgets .    2.671537871003043
mr president , this is an important and urgent matter , and parliament is complying with a request from the commission to come to a decision quickly , because today , you must realise , men and women are dying in kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero , these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid .    2.789638875392162
an urgent request has been referred to us , and we approve it .    3.413082844464391
we have been asked for eur 35 million .    2.7697524438050474
we agree that it may be granted and we call on the commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring , once the decision has been taken , that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible .    2.960844076866716
we are talking about macrofinancial aid .    2.64252830936287
there are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal UNK of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration .    2.3760648500849326
this is not our opinion .    2.8985369465359043
our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region .    3.081056285023766
indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state .    2.719535233773431
the second important problem is that we have been asked for payments , the donors have made commitments and , obviously , we are the only ones actually paying .    3.1965810743808762
the other parties are not paying .    2.584798421614646
we wish to see an end to this one - sided situation regarding requests for financial aid .    2.746548337588431
we would like the commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this .    3.409918605966015
we would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors .    2.926221624887954
this is not in order to limit or be UNK with our financial contribution to kosovo but , quite the contrary , to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors .    3.0567504486604204
from that point of view , the proposed facility is a two - phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest .    2.4894674596101534
finally , we have three questions for the commission in this regard . firstly , we need the commission to give us , on a regular basis , the list and the amounts that other donors contribute .    3.709270423707956
when we come to pay , we want to know what the others are paying .    3.139605970008254
secondly , we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation .    2.569518690074945
during the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet , according to our information , no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date .    2.3317676931691715
this is serious , since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in kosovo .    2.484068003354588
finally , and this follows on from what i have just said , we would like the commission to inform the committee on budgets on a very regular basis , monthly , regarding progress on payments made .    3.3185234182082533
we have commission documents which speak of firm commitments .    2.366536012700908
it is not firm commitments that we need , just plain commitments would suffice , and we need to know what has actually been paid and , more especially , what has not been paid .    3.171569655010496
kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment .    2.6185259374928984
mr president , if we are going to discuss kosovo today , as we have done many times before , then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in kosovo , or of whether in fact anything has been done at all .    3.1416519841808044
what i mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to UNK , and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate .    3.3002683027230963
as of 9 february , there will be something known as the kosovo transitional council , which will comprise representatives of the political parties , the minorities and civil society , and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament .    3.5076994528704155
this is a positive move and we welcome it , but i believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare , for elections are planned for the autumn .    2.8255409445479365
no one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result .    2.981821454751858
no one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis - à - vis unmik .    2.941282603446021
in other words , there are quite a few UNK that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either .    2.7413155009976067
of all people , it is the albanians , who are now being integrated into the transitional council , who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them .    3.5143600811081495
in addition to financial UNK and reconstruction work , urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of serbs , albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the roma of course - in this country , so that at some point in the near future , on the road to coexistence , it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place .    2.8293664311198583
i would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about .    2.7924599242924915
administration - wise there are now 34 tax inspectors .    2.539503570992219
that is excellent news !    2.6945955697353963
there too , people are being encouraged to pay their taxes , for it will not do in the long - term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the eu and from other donors ; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources .    2.8079577854576256
it should also be noted that of the 19 departments , 4 already have administrative leadership , which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto .    2.7093038817573105
there is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law . we have 130 judges and public prosecutors , who have now been UNK in , and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice , with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little , and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions .    3.0496681451995613
another positive development i would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UNK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country .    3.2632502218549497
i believe that is a good thing    4.0115765101793865
i wholly endorse what the committee on budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way .    2.7693256880181267
the eu commission cannot pay for everything .    2.4608191328915483
it is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the fourth pillar , but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay mr kouchner ' s outstanding bills .    2.7950692542993876
one could do so once or twice , but i feel that the un donors should contribute to this as well , for there is a very large hole , as yet UNK , that we are unable to fill .    3.3635684824439127
we have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it .    2.95309975969852
mr president , i would like to offer a few explanations .    2.3357158840407766
in a debate , there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said .    3.847455909605299
however , i would like to concentrate on two points .    2.8339807301738196
firstly , i would like to make it very clear that the union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of kosovo .    3.183892597195711
i would like to point out to mrs UNK that what we have read recently in the press is true , and that figures do not lie .    2.938450005661186
let us make this clear , however much some people may not wish to believe it .    2.5959198436535638
the union has decided to assist with a further eur 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of kosovo , on the basis of an imf report which estimates that a further eur UNK million is needed for that reconstruction .    2.5440561608867664
i would like to say to mrs pack that i am in complete agreement with her when she says that the commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments .    2.65174258749132
i would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some ministers at the last ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the portuguese presidency not to alter , in any circumstances , the financial perspectives agreed in berlin .    2.8778786678256774
this calls into question the agreement which parliament reached , with great difficulty , with the council in december , according to which , when the commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction , the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary .    3.0755052427819525
i would like to appeal to those ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach .    2.1815707093614116
i would like to ask the commission - and i am glad that commissioner solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme , with the corresponding report , requested by parliament , so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up , as we have been promised .    2.98118890258767
lastly , i would like to insist that , although we have agreed to eur 35 million now , we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough , and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for kosovo , which is so badly needed .    3.447933017838626
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , please excuse my late arrival , but this other political issue is still on the agenda today , more is the pity .    2.216959001251095
the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy would advise you to release the eur 35 million , and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need .    2.116656737432796
the things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there .    2.50608438071882
however , this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process .    3.056926051394983
of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the council administration had not forgotten to inform the european parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents .    2.778848700894818
only then would we have been able to conduct proper and UNK discussions .    2.7401227366333485
i urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future .    2.5773234669165466
it is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this .    3.209119660457548
however , we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here .    2.5134353018369486
in other words , we should ensure that the money falls to mr kouchner ' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres .    3.0558997099091365
secondly , even if the commission and the council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there , we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into .    3.0183799419590644
this mission is being conducted under the auspices of the united nations and we cannot have a situation where the european union is the only one to fulfil its obligations .    3.201852886109293
it is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe , in the interests of the persons affected .    2.8253222306940184
this brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms , that is to say , not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south - east europe , and with the aid delivered there .    2.8284237416492477
this is another example of the fact that the european union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence .    3.0511667098836726
we have so many coordinators , who , in turn , are responsible to so many employers , that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators .    2.6669514203496103
perhaps it would be better , however , if the positions of responsibility within the european union and the other institutions from the osce to the united nations , were to get together some time to introduce a uniform , coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there .    3.4436387756827207
i know that the commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this , but if the european union is doing the most work out there , then it should also be given the leadership , and bring coherence to the situation , so that we can be of real assistance to the people .    3.384916515682501
it makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground !    2.3235180252822043
bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of march - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline , that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented , and there is a steady stream of new press conferences , this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of europe !    2.7582888893061184
accordingly , we would like to take this opportunity to urge the commission and council presidency to seize this political initiative , so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our UNK at the end of a month . rather , we must use this initiative to establish a long - term aid strategy for this country , and i hope that in the process , you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months .    3.154014929712754
mr president , when the alliance intervened in kosovo its objective was to re - establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return , with respect for their own heritage and their own culture .    2.3070965319185888
if the alliance is still active in that region , it is with the same objective .    3.4166354515108788
the day before yesterday i was pleased to hear an interview given by the kfor commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in kosovo were starting to be , particularly as regards security , crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level .    2.233434411784138
it is true that economic aid is , in this respect , certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level .    2.6665424139352316
let me reiterate the comment which UNK pack has just made and stress that we , the members of the european parliament , must fulfil our own obligations in this regard , while ensuring , of course , that we are not the only ones to do so .    3.058976351112759
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , mr brok , for his report .    2.558415048799744
if the council had worked as quickly as mr brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on .    2.865456574438542
the council ' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret .    2.9494146883332566
the rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should , and must , provide help swiftly , however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random .    2.85523936806899
i would particularly like to draw your attention to amendment no 5 at this point , which clearly emphasises that it is only possible , and permissible , to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi - public , communal and other authorities and institutions , which are controlled either directly or indirectly by unmik .    2.4197786597001687
commissioner , it must be made clear that we support unmik and the institutions set up by the united nations , in particular pillar 4 of course , and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in kosovo and are still in place .    3.767007911061539
what is to be done with this money ?    3.4929618952626744
i would like to highlight the issue of human rights .    2.8287141264793063
the west fought for human rights in kosovo and what is happening there today ?    3.5300768318776266
we were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the serbs but almost every day UNK things happen : people are killed , people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit .    2.030046512188392
every single day there are attacks on serbs , on the roma , on bosnians , but attacks are also still carried out on albanians .    2.3507769379954175
i was in fact shocked to read in the report , assuming this is true , how an albanian doctor , who was working in the hospital in the serbian quarter of mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties , ultimately had to give up helping his UNK in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life .    2.25450900069349
these are events and situations that cannot be tolerated .    2.3886895016350658
i hear - whether it is true or not i do not know - that the serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the serbian sector of kosovo .    2.6501101632192525
there are , at the very least , rumours that serbian militias are up to their old UNK again .    2.7058301966181633
it is irrelevant , as far as i am concerned , as to whether it is serbs , roma , bosnians or albanians who are threatened or killed in kosovo .    2.4305485014547927
it is also irrelevant , in my view , as to who is working towards separation and division in kosovo .    2.6871622862236593
what is all - important , to my mind , is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve , a multi - ethnic kosovo that is , a kosovo where people can live together .    2.6620829246116995
we need more police officers , as we have nowhere near enough .    2.7458624886388843
we need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish - , we also need funds for the office of high commissioner for human rights .    2.5810587407515406
all of this needs to happen , and quickly too .    2.6789350849750013
if we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise .    2.197307202983553
that is why i believe that we were right to take action quickly , to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available .    3.0622889153122097
only , now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in kosovo , and i would urge the commission to see that these funds are put to good use , notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary .    3.3169616773550263
. ( es ) mr president , i would like firstly to thank the members , and especially the rapporteur , for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue .    3.371970754169514
this will no doubt allow us to release the funds for kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both mr swoboda and mrs pack have mentioned .    2.694929923605341
i think i have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight ' s debate .    2.383477936681696
however , in moving forward , what should we be financing ?    2.381597283458851
in some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with union funds , for example , amendments nos 3 and 5 .    2.7826054115866152
in our view , however , in both respects , greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the united nations which , on the ground , is more aware of the reality than we are .    3.474798950144542
we believe that to prejudge , at the moment , where resources should be directed , would create more practical difficulties .    2.5434632719654093
in short , we should put our faith in those parties who , in these areas , are better equipped than us to make certain decisions .    2.912299861662917
the second concern which i notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by mr bourlanges , but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors .    2.662186622635326
is the commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate ?    2.4464079617457153
some of the amendments in your report pose this question .    3.0693665668708197
i would say to mr bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue , that this is not the fundamental problem , although we recognise it totally .    3.3966724616270976
the fundamental problem is that , at the moment , the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the high level steering group , but it is also true that they have no legal status . this is simply a political commitment .    3.285349460846898
that is the reason why , while accepting its spirit , we would ask that amendment no 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to mr brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of community resources .    2.9044069550298337
i would say the same about amendment no 2 , which we would also accept with a slight modification , since the idea seems to us to be basically correct .    2.875625972144698
amendment no 4 is of a similar nature .    3.076391208658787
on this specific point , we can perhaps offer mr bourlanges greater satisfaction .    2.679324827422507
we have already spoken to the council so that it might include a commission statement in its decision , establishing this element of conditionality .    2.755103535341525
with regard to the second contribution , what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors .    2.8886883811479973
in other words , we should not establish conditionality , or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start , but , nevertheless , we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage .    3.3587793717790757
in this way , we would have no problem in acting immediately . we would not create problems for the kosovar people , but , on the other hand , we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing .    3.4848968660771047
a third problem has been raised by mrs dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes .    2.9581770054149676
i would remind you that these projects are multiannual .    2.627014939191021
the programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account .    2.914062339910429
on the one hand , we have been asked to provide parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and , in this respect , i can tell you that the commission was last week able to provide parliament ' s committee on budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in kosovo .    3.015256113428909
the commission can commit itself to regularly informing parliament of the invitations to tender which are published .    2.194977158723578
we also wish to see these publicised on the internet , so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point .    3.350837698143382
a second point which i would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance .    3.146341801967405
in this respect i would like to tell you that the commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed , on a confidential basis , if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality , on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance .    3.3713494573979483
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen , and i hope that , with the final decision of the council , we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in kosovo by different parties , so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see .    2.9273103607697912
mr president , i am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between parliament , particularly the committee on budgets , and the commission , and we can assure you that , for our part , we shall always be there to assist the commission in the performance of its duties .    3.6325984233196507
i do , however , have one small concern , when i hear the commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the committee on budgets .    3.0762857445025364
there was a clear agreement , good or bad i will not say , but there was a contract . there was a clear understanding between the commission services and the committee on budgets that there was agreement on amendments 4 and 7 , i . e . on the idea of linking the mobilisation , the implementation , of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment .    3.011345925311603
but , if i understand what mr solbes mira says correctly , then this undertaking was only a UNK one .    2.652604628905476
commissioner , an agreement is an agreement .    2.818327275089632
can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the committee on budgets , yes or no ? or are you going to drop this proviso , thus breaking the undertaking made to us ?    2.1798871240944244
no , mr bourlanges , i think it is a substantive problem .    3.485053826870481
the problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted .    2.6157992436021824
what i proposed to you , and what i still say , is that the commission will make a statement , in the council decision , something like this :    4.418802477172956
the exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in kosovo ' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors .    2.4393443839350097
with this , we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed .    4.217790325843368
i am simply asking the commission to come and inform the committee on budgets before implementing the second tranche .    3.3922218615118203
i agree , absolutely . we shall do so .    2.545514625012735
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow .    1.8670405981068408
altener    4.476926908218468
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0011 / 2000 ) by mr langen , on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a european parliament and council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the community - altener ( c5 - 0333 / 1999 - 1997 / 0370 ( cod )    1.9858928318092375
mr president , i would like to thank mr langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in parliament and in the council .    2.495951128884165
the project has been long and problematic .    2.685843233883987
in future too , there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources .    3.1861764107208397
although there is much that is good about the new directive , it is nonetheless not without its defects .    2.968106662145636
one example is the use of peat .    3.2136560767431694
peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels .    2.4804088362873475
if peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable , non - fossil energy source , it must form its own class , especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned .    2.610719392177644
it is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as , for example , coal .    3.0003166706527957
the development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the union ' s dependence on imported energy .    2.794051717448372
research is particularly essential with regard also to the eu ' s next round of enlargement .    3.006851834121126
dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many eastern european countries , whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the soviet union on russian energy .    2.088483610536546
the eu must adhere to the kyoto protocol on climate .    2.540692237156072
we are all concerned about the environment and our children ' s future .    2.944907405659388
the share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased , but it has to be done in a rational manner .    2.9908526737813887
we have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come .    2.4358557150025058
for that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate : nuclear energy .    2.912151938569507
mr president , on behalf of the pse group , i welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the altener ii programme .    3.1108762651193436
firstly , however , i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , mr langen , for the truly excellent work he has done on this report .    3.1752249711336153
i would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the conciliation committee , mr provan .    2.6999686609125866
for as mr langen said just now , we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the conciliation committee .    2.531855627063327
however , we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the UNK of the european parliament throughout .    3.3593942862344175
mr langen mentioned that a series of parliament ' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the council halfway on even the most contentious point , that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the community .    2.5550448572930913
this is not satisfactory - i would like to make that quite clear .    2.962998622941209
however , we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed .    2.724620552112264
for in the course of the next few years , the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double , accounting for at least 12 % of energy consumption .    2.8070818798684605
this is the european union ' s declared aim .    3.280420591470588
that being the case , since altener is the only eu programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources , it will certainly be have a key role .    2.828212860916198
in the first place , this new five - year programme will entail extending the actions in the altener i programme . this will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector , developing local and regional energy agencies , and establishing new networks for approving financial support , to name but a few examples .    2.377556345170715
to my mind though , what is particularly important about the altener ii programme are the new actions for UNK market UNK by renewable energies and those for implementing , supporting and monitoring the community strategy and the community action plan .    2.4404385304110474
we now have available to us a working paper from the commission ' s services on a breakthrough campaign , which is in fact a crucial element of this community strategy .    3.2374505103684714
it contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors .    3.082125951210423
it is very important for this altener programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it .    2.435572070468887
the overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately eur 30 billion .    2.0630460659835395
75 % - 80 % of this is to come from private sources , and this will be supplemented by public funds from the member states and from the regions .    3.548484671081439
in this respect , the altener programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment , and help us to realise our ambition , in the interests of environmental protection , the economy and creating new jobs .    3.1041363035914307
mr president , commissioner , i would like to thank mr langen for his excellent work in this important matter .    2.431499344898167
the conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the altener programme as put forward by the conciliation committee is , after all the difficult phases it has been through , at least satisfactory .    3.0524182530015267
most of parliament ' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to eur 77 million must be seen as positive .    3.0030687844915995
the union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy .    3.1318016769333363
there is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets , however .    2.6625862757323464
the appropriations are needed for pilot projects , research , information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy .    2.308332073901897
the main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the member states .    3.3393632456510476
this programme will hopefully encourage member states to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy .    2.8674743064068062
however , in the future , the union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market .    2.9735094977520924
promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment .    3.6607750022655274
the union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up .    2.3528287681687154
renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use UNK competitiveness .    2.3760555936036716
europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy .    2.9095221603980397
we should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment .    2.5523627971690215
may i also venture to raise the matter of peat ?    3.0357334266607956
peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources .    3.175600364744297
however , it is important , at least in finland , as a UNK used , slowly renewable energy source .    3.4341676070955955
i hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables .    3.82170565884071
it is interesting for me , as a new member of parliament , to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco UNK .    3.1453502041386066
this is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale .    2.480680618667149
in contrast with that , i see the amounts allocated for renewable energies , which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion .    2.744151877100554
seeing the market share that small countries such as denmark have been capable of UNK in this field , because they were the first ones to develop that area , gives one food for thought , i feel , and i think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies .    2.989083972331176
one last word regarding the programme . i think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there .    3.317269970717951
in order to ensure that at least 50 % of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources , it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term .    3.4313382180011227
mr president , may i commence by complimenting mr langen on his work .    2.133752394061528
the activities of the altener programme will promote renewable energy sources and i believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future .    2.4183005380480487
for this reason , i am particularly pleased to see the monies UNK on projects by small and medium - sized enterprises .    2.7446262294606205
the internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone .    2.446119603786231
in this regard , it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit .    2.445709798098308
it is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables .    2.288349777259031
i am pleased that ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend UNK million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector .    2.8148287529331486
i would hope that the contribution of altener would lead to more initiatives .    2.818106829121698
as the final text rightly states , actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities .    2.31716305520335
i can UNK that i have already received significant interest in the altener programme from my own constituency of leinster , a significant portion of which falls within ireland ' s only objective i region .    2.4969390971845304
i support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions , including the energy sector .    2.6138019978713176
in short , we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the kyoto protocol , while at the same time promoting growth in our economies .    2.1431300721663264
altener will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the member states .    3.062851689572923
mr langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the council was initially ff 74 million , whereas the commission proposed 81 . 1 million , a figure which the european parliament supported .    2.853407741032913
an initial conciliation meeting was not successful , because the council would not at that time accept an increase of eur 1 . 9 million .    2.681200848603198
we could not agree with a proposal like this , which challenged the authority of the european parliament .    3.3487689896630566
a second round of conciliation achieved an increase of eur 1 . 1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million .    2.6822322226989446
in spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal , personally , once again i deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the council in this situation is in UNK contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply , job creation and environmental protection , challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to .    2.9612886058430004
in fact , renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives .    2.5585544880300333
however , in spite of the reservations i am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation , i personally support the compromise , by virtue of the programme ' s content , to which the european parliament made an active contribution as , following the entry into force of the amsterdam treaty , this sector become subject to codecision .    2.6854137842395893
it is practically certain that , with the raft of proposed measures and actions , it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12 % renewable energy share by 2010 , UNK the current rate , as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available .    2.5114047560446298
this programme , together with the save ii programme , integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy , establishes a foundation for a real community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence .    2.14758199833135
and , in conclusion , mr president , let me also insist upon the fact that , in addition to the measures proposed , there are also legislative measures and , most especially , adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives .    3.3275073913994175
and i shall end , of course , by congratulating mr langen , our rapporteur , on his work , as well as all the members of the committee and of the conciliation committee .    4.046083030217477
. ( es ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , firstly i wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the altener ii programme in the conciliation committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and , of course , point out that this agreement will allow the altener programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme .    2.776749069425327
all of this will provide greater coordination , transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes , into which we will also have to incorporate the save programme , which we will be discussing soon .    3.268170583258229
i would like to say that the work carried out during this time by parliament has been of a high quality , and i therefore congratulate the rapporteur , mr langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary .    2.952990932881723
obviously , there have been arguments , we had to go to conciliation , as the rapporteur and mr UNK reminded us a moment ago , since at the first meeting no result was achieved , and there had to be a second meeting , despite the fact that the figures were not excessive .    3.0643591536533332
however , i believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement , which , like all agreements , is perhaps not perfect , but which , i believe , allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing .    3.4102096821152443
i would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur , mr langen , on his work , to thank the speakers and , of course , to acknowledge the actions of vice - president provan throughout the conciliation procedure , who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result .    2.670849810556897
save    4.478552987640842
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0010 / 2000 ) by mrs ahern , on behalf of the european parliament delegation to the conciliation committee , on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a european and council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - save ( c5 - 0334 / 1999 - 1997 / 0371 ( cod ) .    2.058890012296662
madam president , i would like to thank the council and commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good - UNK all round , which is not always the case .    2.6859904378011454
i am happy to say that i can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re - worded form .    2.3751759205787164
the financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the council ' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there .    3.376788808037495
i therefore propose that this house agree to adopt the proposals on save and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading .    2.3086616925583674
i would like to remind the house that at second reading parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments , including a re - UNK of the commission ' s original budget .    2.7031041421877804
the commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and i thank the commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the council had proposed was unacceptable .    2.5333817859139307
during the procedure , agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise , implement , complement and assess the community measures .    2.4244857441596497
compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non - legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and , very importantly , the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency .    2.328063902893623
i hope that you will all agree that this is important progress .    3.712216281176694
the issue of the financial UNK was staunchly defended by parliament in the face of the council ' s very meagre opening offer .    3.519280430244606
in the event we had to have several meetings before the council finally increased this to a substantial amount .    2.5441565037368057
we got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which i can recommend to you and which the commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under .    2.6972346118967674
this was an important consideration for us .    2.771645209147323
i would like to say however that it is , and has always been , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real .    3.06550615561473
funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the member states .    2.316066041149926
we have to bear that in mind when approving this programme .    2.4770293394415437
if there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at community level , this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action , including community actions , on energy saving .    3.0944537037206623
where the community can step in is to put the local UNK in touch with each other so that they can actually not re - UNK the UNK in every region .    2.8050408491777916
we have an important part to play in the community in the european union in this regard .    4.091121641300893
save is the only community - wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy .    2.8848799463939594
here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings .    3.471011193934553
we have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business , saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non - UNK .    2.351321555724386
it is something that we can all support .    3.618751475195996
i have to say , like motherhood , although we all support it , sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the UNK or the people engaged in energy - saving .    2.4230219840641665
we could do rather more , considering that we have made great commitments in reducing co2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports .    2.522710960633813
we are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see .    3.282700334642986
if we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do .    3.286546080988981
i would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process .    2.170314845503745
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would once again like to thank mrs ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal , since she has contributed , in collaboration with the other members , to the achievement of a very reasonable final result , which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the commission itself and , of course , on what , from a budgetary point of view , the council had initially accepted .    3.0374585820866713
as mrs ahern has explained very well , the budgets of both the save programme and the altener programme , are basically symbolic budgets , since the burden is UNK by the countries , the states of the union , the regions or even , in some cases , the local authorities .    3.055621554439114
however , despite the fact that the volume is relatively small , it is nevertheless UNK important that there is a common desire throughout the community as a whole to support this type of action , which contributes to our genuine compliance with the kyoto commitments . this action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources , greater safety in our energy supplies and , in the case of save , to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy , thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set .    2.8728488605677938
furthermore , behind these programmes , that is to say , the save programme , which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings , and the altener programme , which concerns renewable energy , there lies an extremely important technological challenge , which , from an economic point of view , may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the union as a whole .    2.906191873196163
with regard to the parliamentary procedure , i would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken , especially the rapporteur , because the majority of parliament ' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the council , in this case practically all of them , although with some modifications . i would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved .    3.265636637621577
this improvement has been achieved with fresh funds , as we said at the time , and it has been achieved while safeguarding this parliament ' s UNK and competences .    3.9036800255947104
from the point of view of the commission , in this interinstitutional game , i believe that this is important and i am very happy to highlight it .    4.1730414640095645
i would like once again to thank all the speakers , and also , especially , the vice - president , mr provan , for his magnificent work throughout this debate , particularly during the conciliation procedure , as well as the chairman of the committee on industry and , also , above all , the rapporteur , mrs ahern , and all the members who have participated in this work .    3.1864013713921278
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow .    1.8670405981068408
culture 2000    3.9967812761280834
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0009 / 2000 ) by mr graça moura , on behalf of the european parliament delegation to the conciliation committee , on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a european parliament and council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ( ' culture 2000 ' ) ( c5 - 0327 / 1999 - 1998 / 0169 ( cod ) .    1.9440153625320886
madam president , i actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate .    2.8042815101704575
unfortunately , there has been no change in the way that the council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it .    2.8950038478359015
we have the feeling , and are in fact convinced , that the member states would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the treaty of maastricht .    3.246029935998641
for no one is very keen to spend money on culture .    2.497443080890735
sadly that is the case and we must face facts .    4.17307197236353
i would like to thank the rapporteur , who really has chipped away UNK at this UNK task , in conjunction with the commissioner of course .    2.3297635777025802
we simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content , of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect .    3.3904600499927655
one seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind , where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision .    2.8345158296492823
what kind of horse - trading system is this ?    2.4838097341358307
certainly not a fair one ! there are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side , UNK for a little more money for culture .    3.1124586949257056
it is downright scandalous what goes on !    2.299434865431043
it is an awful sort of horse - trading , based on unequal positions !    2.3224432358357543
nevertheless , we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to .    3.651696931313925
it lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us .    2.7759475583473985
i believe that the fact that culture and , UNK , education and youth now fall within the same commissioner ' s remit , will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes , which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the european union .    2.934033073227615
if one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied , but then only a tiny bit .    2.2161595977223283
it is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money .    3.5607398457204527
madam president , i agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and i must add that , during the conciliation procedure , i was personally a little disappointed with the council .    3.0824781883379893
on the other hand , it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this parliament , which were minimal anyway .    3.1094290180712356
incidentally , this last point would be unfair to fourteen members of the council , since it was just one , the netherlands , which was responsible for that intransigence .    2.9665698631927357
it has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the council .    2.5457947228311397
this demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution .    2.3247541044112556
however , madam president , these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow , and which the socialists will vote in favour of , will put in place one of the european union ' s most important programmes .    3.698592386858212
by taking action in the field of culture , we are directly contributing to the construction of a european soul , especially given the fact that the sub - programmes which make up " culture 2000 " are superb .    3.1772414813515013
in recent years , these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the UNK and most dynamic citizens of the european union .    2.7957847642218363
lastly , i would like to mention the profoundly human impression i have formed of the rapporteur , mr graça moura : his knowledge , his sense of balance , his intellectual qualities , make him , in my opinion , the best possible rapporteur this report could have had .    2.3094310255949675
congratulations !    3.55451625645586
finally , i would like to congratulate commissioner reding , vice - president imbeni and mr gargani , chairman of the committee on culture , for the firm and intelligent position which , each within his own role , they have maintained during the entire conciliation process .    2.5204509251145963
madam president , commissioner , rapporteur , i would like to start by thanking mr graça moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this culture 2000 programme .    2.6592921453113907
it has been said before , and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions , that culture is , of course , extremely important as an area unto itself - i would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the european idea .    2.7561827287457334
it is also of great importance to citizens .    3.036036448805731
we should , above all , not lose sight of this . the impetus given to the european idea by this programme is having an enormous impact , especially on small linguistic areas such as the netherlands which not only has national potential , but is also relying on support from the programme , mainly from a language point of view .    2.7901035753705368
today , we have arrived at the end of a long road .    3.0849055700769674
i would nonetheless like , as others have done , to touch upon the procedure , which is unclear and , above all , unwanted .    2.8884299604660124
codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand .    2.5272904944252517
they are like a snake UNK its own UNK .    2.621488335328074
there is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand : anything is open for discussion , as long as the budget UNK fixed .    2.6407475338621356
as it happens - and i would like to add this for the sake of the netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage .    3.08093728870441
the result is 30 % growth , so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result .    3.058443526902344
of course , it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and i for one will always advocate this - but i do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes .    2.7913425160386174
culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas .    2.4262554059242745
a great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the structural funds , and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind .    2.956558570997858
fortunately , i am on the committee on regional policy .    3.8395337037590016
so i myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention .    2.5639273144831454
i think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because , if it happens to be cancelled , then surely this does not benefit the citizen .    3.015193896715151
i have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect .    2.4687908276811954
however , i do think that it is necessary , as he always states too , that , in the next igc , changes will be made to codecision , when unanimity will no longer be necessary .    3.599714906591623
we are very positive about the many improvements which have been made : no more UNK - projects , room for cultural networks , and sufficient attention to promoting reading , UNK and translation companies .    2.5619743809568423
this is especially important to smaller linguistic areas . i would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also mrs reding for culture 2000 .    2.6277588758215344
all that remains for me to say is : time to get down to business .    2.852345372293296
madam president , all that i wanted to say has been covered by those fellow members who spoke before me and i think there is unanimity among the groups in the european parliament and among those of us on the committee on culture .    3.030509201729082
i too must say that i will be voting for this joint text for a council and european parliament decision with a very heavy heart .    3.0318371250097034
not because our delegation , our rapporteur and the chairman mr gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because i have any strong objection to commissioner reding ' s attitude - i think that , given the framework she was operating in , her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the council .    2.351989820810159
it is shameful !    2.8534267932878556
that figure of eur 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the european union !    2.9114414177448924
when we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups , young UNK , pioneering activities in the arts , writers , to humiliate them and send them UNK with a UNK on the back and thirty rejection UNK in such a way that they begin to perceive europe as something foreign , something opposed , contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the european union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro , not just enlargement , nor geostrategic UNK , but also to encourage culture to UNK in this affair of european unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end .    2.4388684611725604
   3.702094057753363
   3.702094057753363
so long as we continue to have unanimity , so long as yesterday the dutch government was able to impose those eur 167 million as an UNK and so long as a government with mr haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue , we will never progress .    2.5351938549597333
that is why it is very important for the intergovernmental conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the european parliament ' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the european area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments .    3.176020950897944
madam president , i absolutely agree with the rapporteur ' s analysis and i would also like to thank the chairman of the committee on culture , mr gargani , for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also , considerably difficult .    2.782186673978033
of course , we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes , but everyone hoped that the culture programme could help to promote , for example , the unique features of each cultural sector , even - and i could say especially - of the unique features of less well - known sectors .    2.742374750485861
we hope that this , at the least , will come about during the evaluation process .    2.8143014230450523
we sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action , among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social , as well as economic , development of a people .    3.362428417606415
and a fully - fledged europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully UNK its roots , highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well - known .    2.1830119068222595
as for the important educational task which the european union must carry out as regards culture , one of the programme ' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the council at least - certainly not the commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action : the document which UNK the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this .    2.9296546860695796
the overall growth of the european union and the awareness of being european citizens : this is why we believe that the culture 2000 programme , albeit with a scarcity of funds , can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal .    2.991472241498728
madam president , i will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that i support the adoption of culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur , mr graça moura , who took over from our former colleague UNK UNK .    2.6755222795339284
both of them have done a first - class job .    2.9563189709721724
alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day , culture may not seem that important , but it is ; and we have to be careful in the european parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important .    3.5274540785157535
why do i say that culture is important ?    3.1159107633007497
well in simple economic terms , europe ' s culture adds to genuine prosperity .    2.5567491879169997
where would europe ' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ?    2.62048005874285
but , more importantly than that , cultural activities are what make mankind civilised .    2.3682546845882673
culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs ; and an UNK society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy .    2.6276427121135724
cultural diversity is important , and it is under threat .    3.9521300207255288
however , it is not under threat from europe .    2.9528960460859492
we do drink port wine , and we do like german beer , and we even use finnish UNK , but it is not from europe that culture is under threat .    2.91222387093524
what i do see right across europe is people drinking UNK UNK , eating UNK , wearing UNK UNK , watching UNK UNK and often doing all this at the same time .    2.623234665770441
now i do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending europe ' s culture , but i do believe in lending a helping hand when we can .    3.20217865053199
that is what culture 2000 is about .    2.5394702474595645
so , i say to the council of ministers : keep this programme genuinely under review .    3.1115292828651286
are we doing enough ?    2.898417807253913
and , i say to madame reding , thank you for the support and the help you have given so far , keep up the good work , we are on your side .    3.0345397338110263
madam president , i too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur , UNK moura , and commissioner reding , for their contribution to the creation of this programme .    3.0197487416124322
the culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between parliament and the council .    2.8479422000385783
the outcome can be considered reasonable , when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the council .    3.7096887929565545
we have to hope that at the forthcoming igc we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture .    3.2402977071027506
it is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the council .    2.7167586989667893
the framework programme on culture is replacing the present kaleidoscope , ariane and raphael programmes .    2.1167518145923885
when implementation of the programme begins , i hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full . i believe and hope that , despite the UNK on us all of the new technology , literature will maintain its status .    2.876204425030125
we need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial .    2.032088798536729
literature likewise plays an important part in the way it UNK our cultural heritage , increases mutual familiarity and UNK linguistic wealth and the diversity of UNK .    2.7018887777478273
in this connection , i am very glad to say that soon after the UNK and culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the council of ministers in march in lisbon , the country holding the presidency of the eu is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries .    3.3081243667071707
i hope that this conference will also encourage the commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society .    2.92584287385497
madam president , commissioner , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , somehow or other , today ' s agenda has come full circle .    2.536194609182334
we have had a great deal to say today about europe as a community of values , about tolerance , human dignity , human rights , a positive approach to the enlargement process , transparency and respect for each other .    3.09592299965244
youth , education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values , for giving the citizens confidence in the european union and making it credible in their eyes .    2.5311405041622606
the funding approved by the council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the european union ' s goals .    3.323960416800512
cultural activity creates identity .    2.73397400072124
cultural activity is an expression of individuality , of an individual ' s own personality ; it UNK relationships and UNK .    2.519723735141084
we want a UNK europe .    2.8352338498347613
we want a europe based on the principle of diversity within unity .    3.0151429452584977
we want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences .    2.406129705838456
that is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget , the allocation of funds that is , into the different types of measure .    3.1312433915528683
that is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures , because we want to promote the small and medium - sized entities and activities performed by individuals ; because we want to see thousands of flowers UNK .    2.4210886406591388
i would like to second what the previous speaker had to say .    2.588968850342991
there is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle , codecision procedure , and conciliation committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen , and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a european consciousness .    2.898176087601184
madam president , as we have heard , all the groups have a common political enemy in the council .    2.9147603629688885
it is not by chance that the committee on culture ' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure , for one or other member state in the council always holds culture hostage to other interests .    2.9358564575920063
in this way , the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a UNK instrument of the first order .    3.2240049747096835
the battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years , and now , at long last , the european parliament can give the go - ahead .    2.7276950391329926
the council could not be moved , not even when the UNK programmes kaleidoscope , ariane and raphael finished .    2.6394068415568053
a pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap .    2.347102939762118
this showed up the weaknesses of the european union ' s cultural policy activities once again .    2.6957360767556016
the political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support .    2.239766368448605
out of UNK applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of eur 6 . UNK million could be considered .    2.2183971699946246
the council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate parliament to the tune of even a single euro !    2.565580962915157
and so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004 .    2.2093522614744883
that is the same as a single , medium - sized , german UNK house ' s expenditure over the same period , when here in europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years !    2.2583164756544454
there is a blatant discrepancy here !    2.765343646159443
and so we are going to have to be content , albeit very grudgingly , with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content .    3.668757038655464
previous speakers have already UNK pointed this out .    2.9740628685499098
we can only hope that it will , after all , be possible to persuade the council to have a change of heart one day .    3.9778058156465135
perhaps the council will come to understand that cultural activities do the european union good , not harm !    3.441438577644888
cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity , far more so than any transport directive , however important it might be .    2.442130710557837
providing support for culture meets with wide - spread acceptance , and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions .    2.626324560604991
what , may i ask , is the council afraid of ?    3.4488251605723854
i have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at european organisational level has been firmly asserted , but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the european states will make .    2.6953212294458186
i shall simply stress my own personal complaint because , in the end , we did not manage to adopt a review clause .    2.910289449678191
however , mrs reding was certainly receptive and UNK , and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years , and therefore to change the situation .    3.0391036206755992
the cultural programmes launched in years past - kaleidoscope , ariane and raphael - are being replaced by a single programme , culture 2000 , where - and i must stress this here very forcefully - the rapporteur censures a position which should give the european parliament cause for reflection - as someone said this afternoon - but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor .    2.300499211963445
this is not rhetoric , but the new UNK of a modern liberalism which unites the european states and constitutes a turning point for the european parliament and the commission .    3.081363386934375
we agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds , this evening ' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for europe , which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor ; culture then , and an institutional aspect , the basis for structuring a vast community , a prerequisite for economic growth , and not the complete opposite , as europe , in its cultural UNK , has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past .    2.6537314439821236
man and culture are priorities , and culture can result in economic growth .    2.3634726656149856
let us UNK this result , derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy .    1.898709183199286
madam president , may i first thank mr graça moura for UNK his way through the rather tough UNK and UNK that have made up this conciliation UNK .    2.4448413555911954
it seems to me when entering the conciliation process for culture 2000 , having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate .    2.271156792860153
again , because these UNK are not entirely straight forward , we have to thank vice - president imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our community .    2.397361333390474
the fundamental question , it seems to me , that faces this parliament , the commission and the council is : what is europe ?    3.949647615985106
what does it mean and what does europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries ?    2.2418020251487834
europe is its people , its history and now its collectivity ; but the reason why culture 2000 is so important to us is for this : i will wager that when we ask the question - ' what is europe ? ' - we answer it by saying , ' it is our art , it is our literature and it is our heritage . '    2.71423153728464
that is what culture 2000 represents .    2.4800178496102303
it represents the possibility of sustaining a european identity in the twenty - first century , an identity which UNK the echoes of division , of war , of poverty , of opportunity , of poverty UNK la UNK .    2.283459314700846
and more than this - and this is more UNK , madam president , it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive , that are cross - cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require .    2.7526059982691686
it promotes mobility , and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded .    2.573535569208337
my only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver .    2.5448207316749913
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , we have now come to the end of a long road .    3.177742319881773
we shall thus , in the course of the next five years , have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear , well - structured and , i am sure , successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector .    3.1353181180202245
it is with great satisfaction that i today welcome this ' happy ending ' in this house , and i thank you for it .    2.8416969567828185
i wish to thank everyone in this parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process .    2.945625046567932
i should like to express UNK thanks to the committee on culture , youth , education , the media and sport , particularly to its rapporteur , mr graça moura , its chairman , mr gargani , the european parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups , the conciliation committee and its chairman , mr imbeni .    2.826518087645173
they all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution .    2.332100097658086
throughout the negotiations , they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally UNK negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time .    2.6572001268926124
we now have a framework programme , the first of its type for the cultural sector , and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive , but also more thorough and detailed manner .    3.021305803185142
i would like to express my delight , with you , at this pleasing outcome . in spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions , these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and i would like to pick up on what mr gargani has just said , that the commission made a statement regarding a mid - term assessment .    2.5641717794477374
it stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with article 7 of the european parliament and council decision , it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme , and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the community financial perspectives .    3.833354876484258
if need be , the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision , and this should be achieved by 30 june 2002 .    3.4195605449773154
ladies and gentlemen , this is a formal commitment , not just words on paper .    3.38137111447074
all this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area , within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features , in all their diversity , but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of europe may participate fully in them .    2.5142337214865234
it is thanks , too , to parliament ' s action , preferring a number of small - scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens ' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale .    3.0543378883635195
this is going to lead us to make ' culture 2000 ' the programme of the citizen .    3.0684467387687047
i know that you , as members of parliament , in your own regions and countries , are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers , as one member of parliament said , go to make a vast UNK carpet .    3.076526927696242
i should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens , both in personal as well as in social and economic terms , but a right which it is our job to assert , and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the union .    2.9490201664954356
this is what our european ' culture 2000 ' programme offers .    2.261742658249635
it does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various member states .    2.969571181126295
such policies are necessary , and i would like to see them developed further .    3.1486672419778747
it simply adds to them , complements them , building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries .    2.283516511490103
i feel therefore that extending and enriching european citizens ' participation in culture is a crucial task , one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it , and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our union .    2.586351292230999
a number of members of parliament have quite rightly raised this point . if the union is purely an economic union , then it is a UNK project .    3.227542681121211
however , if it is a union of culture , civilisation and participation , then it becomes a living thing .    3.1377652216348286
this is the foundation , ladies and gentlemen , which i intend to develop , and i shall take the following five areas into special consideration : firstly , providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their UNK to find the support it deserves in our programme .    2.5347860893978207
secondly , encouraging exchanges , mobility and training in the cultural sector .    2.2129414630264486
thirdly , promoting cooperation between cultural operators .    2.401378503592034
fourthly , increasing UNK for culture , with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and , fifthly , protecting the common cultural heritage on the european scale as well as the history of the peoples of europe , and making them better known .    2.6685813560396117
the new programme will , i am sure , in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency , efficiency and balance , prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures .    3.196906316453784
madam president , i reiterate my thanks to parliament for its support and for , once again , having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the union .    2.521595773305331
i am certain that it will not be disappointed , having given us its support , and i personally undertake to keep parliament informed , as things progress , of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens , which i hope will be great measures for the future of the union .    3.4748952398484256
thank you , commissioner .    2.120450226877885
i think we can also thank the rapporteur once again .    3.289125446985994
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow .    1.8670405981068408
( the sitting was closed at 9 . 55 p . m . )    1.9796382330103166
end - of - life vehicles    3.248083627773886
the next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading ( a5 - 0006 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection , on the common position established by the council with a view to the adoption of the european parliament and council directive on end - of - life vehicles [ 8095 / 1 / 1999 - c5 - 0180 / 1999 - 1997 / 0194 ( cod ) ] ( rapporteur : mr florenz )    2.4266365405715105
even though they can no longer be driven , these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders ; and not just intra - community borders , but also those outside the union .    2.5131917350947934
it is therefore only right that the european union should draw up community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed .    2.7039806519643204
we believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the house should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground - breaking .    2.9657576802002557
we therefore have a number of amendments .    3.6925837271213995
i personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective .    3.5365576328834374
i do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive .    3.090541414587296
nor do i think that motorcycles should be included , as the distinctive culture of recycling within the UNK industry UNK the need for a european directive in this area .    3.2621438920469146
i want special - purpose vehicles such as UNK to have high recovery quotas .    2.400206692360534
this is my main concern in this matter .    2.593241202045571
in my opinion , the directive solidly UNK the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in europe .    2.3319223994766554
this can be left as the commission has proposed with the member states ensuring the appropriate collection points for UNK cars .    3.0508586884837667
this will involve , for example , disposing of more than 32 million UNK of used oil , removing break fluid , etc .    2.3942489237297355
an important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts .    3.7838475481884104
what should we do with the shredded products ?    2.940779186613705
we should not overlook the fact that , although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery , they are by no means the only point .    2.9239698688526627
do not forget that , in the case of cars , 80 % of environmental impact comes through driving , 1 % through recovery and 19 % through construction .    2.606871655817629
quotas are not , therefore , the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility , just one of many .    3.1656010664725196
of course we need to aim high , but quotas must not become an end in themselves .    2.596416583917452
we must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars .    2.6451246242802866
i am far UNK to see us move away from today ' s car , weighing 1 , 400 kg and driving an average of 200 , 000 km , to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1 , 000 kg .    1.9973583597797557
this would at least mean 400 kg times 200 , 000 km less transportation .    2.033422271017078
this would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in co2 which , if i have rightly understood the kyoto protocol , is the important factor .    2.8307488053641623
we therefore consider that , in future , vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less co2 and should receive preferential treatment in their UNK quotas .    2.258522090640195
it should not be for each member state , but for you and your staff , commissioner , to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles ( and there is also talk of 3 - litre vehicles ) should receive preferential treatment .    2.8177847077638116
we think they should .    2.9902343734385863
may i say something about costs .    2.8144225647047967
some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers ; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer .    3.422558078610662
however , this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state - UNK monopoly on recycling .    2.218774573006494
i can only warn you against UNK to this .    2.6016055050451605
there are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty - fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car .    2.0206308013130956
the money from this pool , system , or however you want to picture it , would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder .    2.372249836422684
this too is a particular desire of my group .    2.759354077660831
our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage , namely that we won ' t be an immediate candidate for the court of justice when the directive is adopted .    2.4131649954708267
this is why i propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer .    2.1230314528717527
as for a ban on certain materials : of course we need one !    2.5461798338628383
a car has dangerous components which we must ban long - term .    2.933232167512932
this means that we need a pressure instrument .    2.9167297672267467
the commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives .    2.90657261215205
there are a number of sound amendments .    2.925360402490163
this parliament has been given more authority , so let us use it !    3.146863925159753
let us have the courage to put together a ground - breaking directive .    2.4743874657568026
a directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this house .    3.0861261065102097
i ask for your support .    2.7211616843297093
mr president , i almost feel like saying , " UNK " , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work , and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur , mr florenz .    3.2929278965322957
i do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which , today , can only be removed at local authority expense , i . e . the taxpayers ' expense .    2.7123302772379296
the principle of ' polluter pays ' is not being applied .    2.493460021170113
vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by community legislation , in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end - of - life vehicles .    2.8492234462533403
the only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future .    3.339697065005764
it has not , however , been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle .    2.9429073822515406
on the other hand , we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find ( a ) materials that are easier to recycle and ( b ) to set up recycling industries .    2.755001292407037
i should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling , UNK and incineration , as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions .    2.6237788918793865
this is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end - of - life vehicles and the former directives , including the one on auto - oil , which we voted on a few years ago .    2.642644644167405
we must therefore congratulate the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection , on having the wisdom , in order to make things perfectly clear , to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage .    2.3585672572794816
in conclusion , let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still UNK our forests , lakes and UNK .    2.747355346431696
once again , the principle of ' polluter pays ' is not being applied . the taxpayer is still footing the bill .    2.332765347038803
we simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive .    3.2749109316238774
it means ecological progress for europe , and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion .    2.6551236951399875
all the same , there is one point on which we are in conflict .    4.360047812067451
in the grand scheme of the directive , it is perhaps a minor point , but nevertheless a disputed one .    2.7629711935860124
it concerns the issue of recycling costs .    3.4693228807966916
here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year ' s debate in the council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs .    2.425500145206623
last february in this house we UNK decided ( and we social democrats are UNK to this ) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question !    2.4920248879301705
so who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of ?    3.1005327824877296
for us this is straightforward : in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars .    2.637896964270381
and what about vehicles which are already on the road ?    2.9417422355692637
let us look at an example . rover in great britain , if they were responsible for all end - of - life cars , would actually be responsible for 5 . 8 million cars within the european union and would immediately have to set aside eur 250 million against recycling costs , whereas a manufacturer from korea building similar cars would only have to shell out UNK , as a representative of deutsche bank put it .    2.316271308082659
such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection ; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in europe .    1.9778918243929553
consequently , for end - of - life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end - of - life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs .    2.7956160950385773
i can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full UNK and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds .    2.704523517034175
however , i would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in europe , so that these jobs can be secured in the future .    2.637635278176748
i am in favour of stringent environmental requirements , as you know from the auto - oil programme and the debate on UNK emissions , but i believe that they should be the same for everyone !    3.4608112510509343
firstly , because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives .    2.8448091770664785
secondly , because it can promote recycling , which is important .    3.729261968214461
thirdly , because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals .    2.6947627837375743
this is also an important point .    3.152934180534464
the directive affords a european framework , also to member states who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these .    3.0520492503485612
so , first of all , we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level . this will , of course , provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of .    2.8306524557686097
secondly , we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position .    3.1907921326121573
as from 2006 , therefore , all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners .    2.365934364579007
needless to say , this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way .    3.2301812606208555
is this too much of a burden ?    2.883222629622804
there is , however , one thing we should not overlook .    4.0143093238192735
the directive applies to complete cars , that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing .    2.642635231130227
according to the experts , few of these complete cars are of no value .    2.2599763898328424
after all , recycling and the re - use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss - making .    3.106319304374825
quite the reverse , in fact . at present , there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them , and a decent one at that .    3.2337045927760033
this directive encourages the whole of this sector .    3.18033748416094
it is a sector which comprises small and medium - sized businesses .    2.439985510121467
since , in this case , transport costs are high , a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised , because transporting an end - of - life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity .    2.9683368497891873
i think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles , and i think we ought to add this provision to it .    3.296738962400927
i think , therefore , that vintage cars ought to be exempt .    2.9854576973153426
also , it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer .    3.4843996420042664
that is a basic principle which we must uphold .    2.9727230820071635
as manufacturers are responsible for the design , they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase .    3.0725739839562674
we must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer , as stipulated in the common position .    2.6034716230350567
i find this a well - balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things .    2.989686569536151
i think we need to retain it .    3.2134838378238886
this is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence .    3.0071750365161956
after all , we are all aware how difficult it was within the council to bring this common position about , and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position .    3.4449872460189153
in my opinion , we should not jeopardise that common position , because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons .    3.2719442038406368
i would ask you to support this common position .    2.726969397704253
our group will , at any rate , do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well - balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including , for example , the way in which the costs are to be distributed .    3.188134242677087
mr president , we need to take an important decision today .    2.9491723101509946
does this european parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer ' s liability , that is to say that cars , once they have reached the end of their lives , are the responsibility of the car manufacturer ?    3.0870183564016975
no , according to the christian democrats in amendment no . 38 : car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50 / 50 .    2.364078878461119
it is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50 / 50 compromise is included that this does not work .    2.312534845076353
packaging still accounts for a mountain of UNK in europe and is a burden upon the environment .    2.8824488372221477
some of the socialists under the direction of mr bernd lange say : yes , we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to amendment no 45 .    2.4646059138490997
the common position stipulates 2006 .    2.769802444962104
according to the group of the greens , this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations .    3.1526078603765035
i would therefore urge my colleagues not to support amendment no 38 of the christian democrats and amendment no 45 of some of the socialists .    2.749247106023962
if car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars , they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re - used more easily and more UNK .    2.633324734940391
the problem of plastic and pvc will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant - based UNK .    2.1449555717191484
this is ultimately cheaper , also for the consumer .    2.8226717581582426
for twenty years , the majority within parliament has attempted to make european environmental policy UNK .    2.8362156166344192
today , this green position is being threatened under pressure from , in particular , the german and french car industries .    2.452988519749961
that is why i urge you to vote against amendments nos 38 and 45 .    2.563708917040128
we , the green group , by and large support the common position .    2.543248961243638
mr president , the waste from end - of - life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances .    2.2743399542816762
we in the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area .    2.183090599931993
with this directive , we have the chance to take a big step forward , but this presupposes that the council ' s position is not UNK to UNK and weakened in parliament ' s reading of it .    4.085501109819949
if they were adopted , many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive .    3.390574481003892
this applies , above all , to amendments from the group of the european people ' s party but also , unfortunately , to some of the amendments from mr lange , as i see it .    3.3490290372297125
it is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries , for example in germany , went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted .    2.755812608610421
for ourselves , it is crucial that the following principles should apply .    3.0716304671797947
the polluter should pay .    2.909696815546269
this means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility , financial as well as otherwise , for recycling vehicles .    3.026254696746237
there must be rules governing existing vehicles too .    2.3946443474886148
where this aspect is concerned , we cannot accept any weakening of the council ' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force .    3.2177694852467225
there should be no falling - off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years , and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead .    2.8205061614770233
we shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations .    2.4426280423152775
if those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive , this would be very detrimental , not only from an environmental point of view but also for the european parliament ' s credibility on environmental issues .    3.1298392240309565
reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries , for example my own country , sweden .    3.6679291036174013
i was myself a car worker before i was elected .    2.2928421668546815
i believe i am one of the few members of this parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars .    2.8738856356344566
i think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry .    2.8235531591185405
these would , of course , be to the advantage of modern , progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms .    2.548602571291483
it is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the european union .    3.3408615096971586
mr president , i am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this parliament , as indeed it is for the citizens of europe .    3.191619557463219
there is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment .    2.204996115734577
our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests .    2.9314654829908147
each year , there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the european union . this in itself generates a large amount of waste .    2.736329893669532
car manufacturers , the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars .    2.370159805578656
we know that in the netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end - of - life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the european union .    2.3185832708658207
from an irish perspective , i know that the irish department of the environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in ireland in the near future to deal with end - of - life vehicles .    2.7661126184144353
car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re - use , recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years .    3.2928612307663987
in accordance with new provisions included in the amsterdam treaty all the 370 million consumers within the european union have a right to consumer - related information .    2.838200103568899
i believe eu consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally - friendly practices in the coming year .    2.138057678753132
my final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the european community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations .    3.2458041565881475
i also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials , a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation .    2.7226029936893585
in this regard , we are certainly on the right track , but as some members have already stressed , the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers ' responsibility will become a shared responsibility .    2.929971474581656
i would like to say that in italy , considerable headway has been made in this sector ; we are perhaps the first in europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end - of - life vehicles off the market , but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high , and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market .    2.6930959437185655
we need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter .    2.8018068768272992
in italy , we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80 % of old cars , but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in italy industry often UNK to lay - offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of italy .    2.4785880365979605
we must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - parliament is sometimes a little extremist , adopting positions that are either extremely pro - green or extremely anti - green - and , all things considered , find a way to combine the effort made by mr florenz and that of other members , who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible .    2.244603294919944
these worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this ; i think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem , that is , to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements .    3.3542344067204057
mr president , this directive deals with the UNK small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life .    2.7440008096474284
to that extent , it might be thought desirable , even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity .    3.5622227971877822
the key questions now are who pays the eur UNK per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year ?    1.9926411101824735
who pays for the collection , the dismantling , the disposal and so on ?    2.68929879157702
and should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made ?    2.2679563384140744
the proposal from the council , the common position , is that manufacturers should pay the lot .    4.0138292063842975
that would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the european union .    2.7274391004037377
that cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars .    2.2409252411534015
because european car manufactures have been operating here for many , many more decades than companies from japan , korea and elsewhere , that would be a much greater burden on the older european companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere .    2.099376259237633
i commend mr florenz , mr lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs .    2.280478214591229
i also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from germany , italy , ireland , spain , sweden and britain , to remove the retrospective nature of this measure .    2.2827597569821796
retrospective law is bad law , it is unfair law and often it is UNK law .    2.8885674993886186
most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest , which clearly there is not in this case .    2.750326781408823
that is why i have called for a roll - call vote on this .    2.469412380513544
mr president , once again i would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive , and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague , bernd lange .    3.020999288329662
these amendments actually have the advantage - and i should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives .    2.6459315559132808
the council ' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all , or a significant part , of the costs of recovery and recycling .    3.121199220751689
but , as mr lange so rightly said , this solution is totally unfair to european car manufacturers .    2.8721194037051396
coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry , i can tell you that it is not possible , retroactively , to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road , i . e . effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80 % of the total number of cars in europe .    2.502150107404413
this solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs .    2.364993430263674
the common position puts european car manufacturers in a UNK position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the european market .    3.5058214313487595
of course , we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby . we are here to build a europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive .    2.6529016147964617
this is why , i urge you to support the amendments tabled by bernd lange . these amendments will be supported by the group of the party of european socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting member states the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints , since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the members states , and some of them work perfectly well , will be able to continue to operate .    2.670956005730949
let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must , of course , be exempt from the scope of this directive .    2.590025490107544
cars are also part of our cultural heritage . i think we would all agree on that .    3.219631408966229
having said that , one of the stumbling blocks concerns article 12 , i . e . the date on which the directive will come into force .    2.7931048123034565
parliament ' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive ' s entry into force , for new vehicles , is not terribly realistic .    2.7926386463482933
the european car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be UNK even though they were not designed for recycling .    3.195690753440428
the common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road .    2.3335099061434925
this would , furthermore , make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional UNK .    2.6791527095673686
like my group , i shall therefore support this aspect the common position which , i feel , offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection .    2.8361421596654637
mr president , the european parliament is today facing an important decision .    2.711641642609533
will we give our backing to forward - looking environmental and consumer protection or , as the amendments of florenz , lange and others cause me to fear , will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the german car industry ?    2.356331241083697
the credibility of parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake .    2.7717906940053076
it would be shameful to say the least if the european parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 member states and the european commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection !    3.2181062336230264
the intention of florenz and lange in their amendments is obvious : to UNK the directive !    2.5398549803506896
the proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation .    2.2273925943507074
in setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more .    2.179756783007651
this is totally unacceptable .    2.7545362733564587
i therefore appeal to the german delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today !    2.3575514594480516
the red - green federal government has not exactly covered itself with UNK in the debate on the end - of - life vehicles directive .    2.772252687675781
do not continue in this UNK !    3.2123859020419308
the UNK about competitive disadvantages is UNK if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the german car industry .    2.2568416143602263
start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers !    2.837258567464924
vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry !    3.057979731630339
mr president , this directive has been under discussion since 1997 .    2.586252180146865
it is high time that we reached an agreement .    2.463934295222213
since i more or less share the views of my colleague , mr sjöstedt and the representative of the greens , mr de UNK , i am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me , and i will highlight just two issues .    3.4432016837727355
firstly , and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal , the idea , which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste , that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution .    3.0872706959215854
another point is that waste should not be UNK or crushed , not only in the case of lead , cadmium and mercury , but also in the case of waste which contains pvc .    3.20594125234726
parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context .    2.943931327426872
the other question is who should bear the cost .    2.623339787335198
i agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay , and this proposal expresses that idea very well .    2.8440321030495026
producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006 , as some of the amendments propose .    3.270324258124307
we are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading .    2.9802598383200967
it is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials .    2.1202984341153277
i believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines .    2.40623250542937
lastly , mr president , i believe we should favour the creation of small and medium - sized businesses which , if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised , can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area , preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies .    2.617470518847346
mr president , today the european parliament must face up to real responsibilities .    2.9254396817568917
we have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year .    3.14649030616262
in some of our member states , voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our UNK , UNK and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks , inhabited occasionally by an UNK UNK UNK .    2.962079081682307
i come , of course , from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in europe and in third countries .    2.850170124054029
i can gauge its importance for my country ' s international reputation .    2.461978451807605
i know of the proactive attitude of the european car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end - of - life vehicles .    2.4077788368038973
i am aware of the difficulties the council experienced in finding a compromise .    2.596625090058778
that is why , today , we must be understanding UNK , concerned for our environment .    2.9995965948221754
this will either be the century of waste management or it will not .    2.6302720955366823
as far as i am concerned , at least , the principle of ' polluter pays ' must be applied .    2.7617235119327206
the car industry , increasingly more UNK of the environment , has , i am sure , anticipated this kind of increasing awareness .    3.6479309084992004
it is the member states , however , who will have to implement this directive , and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions , the UNK and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in italy or in finland .    3.1649255887380723
i am opposed to making the car owners liable .    2.348661996162252
the men and women on the move throughout europe pay for their car and their UNK UNK , pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement .    2.3784896658451227
it would certainly be unwise for my fellow members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the european parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer .    2.8764764404437035
how , furthermore , can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within europe .    2.264162203439911
who is to pay for recycling the car i bought in france if i register it in belgium ?    2.366513077190618
which national fund will pay for my end - of - life vehicle ?    2.415520797718576
let us beware , too , of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application .    2.4932968986602773
mr president , most of the time , the european parliament , UNK by environment committees , does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the european commission or the council , so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view .    3.64565719522195
now , a sound common position submitted by the council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in parliament .    2.781745941592535
every year , we UNK a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances .    2.5831557602955333
this is why it is important to prevent waste materials .    2.5686433261767947
we should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals , as well as of other dangerous substances and materials .    2.436231321252193
in addition , car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re - use .    2.278672212533326
what is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately .    2.0184287491935544
i therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re - use and recycling which have been proposed by the council .    2.600759792609756
these days , the complete dismantling of end - of - life vehicles is economically viable .    2.2665075183186194
this means that we move away from shredding .    2.666749564270082
the best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and / or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost .    2.3592230039990745
the so - called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation .    2.441470879505776
if the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied , it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably .    2.648651294933733
finally , this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity .    2.787180786109716
a laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay , at the expense of the environment .    2.632707400921771
why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled ? if we are , then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the council on the result achieved .    3.232699442618913
mr president , i hold mr florenz in high UNK .    2.1179012316699053
he has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry .    2.51831465629637
add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and , against that background , find a compromise . that was not easy .    2.831690450673055
overall , i am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position .    2.8944959368238203
i would like to comment on two things . firstly , vintage cars and UNK .    2.4172944443773656
these should indeed be excluded from the directive . secondly , the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars .    3.080664858094693
i do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way .    3.3087125281056107
the manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and / or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost .    2.4569536625118893
in my opinion , there is too much initial hesitation .    3.005250452238205
the car lobby has led too many people up the garden path .    2.22421533317466
i would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on .    2.591391593882047
these costs are not very high .    3.1162866937588225
in the member state where i come from , you are talking about 150 UNK per car .    3.366251776679198
if you charge this from day one , you can process the old cars straight away .    2.238124885073463
a very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards , which used to be a common feature in our member states , would then disappear .    2.8169269290974293
i think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible .    2.5779779538002887
this is positive because , in that way , the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto european roads will actually be processed appropriately , and this will benefit us all .    2.5901218416927065
mr president , the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end - of - life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re - use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars .    2.247884849819621
i therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers ' liability .    2.9942034984894335
if we do reduce it , we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste .    2.155509679270129
the common position , which was arrived at with great difficulty in the council , which the commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in parliament ' s committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , complies fully with the environmental requirements . i therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers ' liability .    2.5992326393842604
if these amendments are adopted , i think that we shall cause parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues .    2.777631305829292
so far , we here in parliament have been positive UNK for environmental protection but now , if the amendments proposed by mr florenz and mr lange are adopted , we are to become a negative factor for the environment in europe .    3.03248062821477
what is more , if we reduce manufacturers ' liability on this issue , this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas , for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from UNK and other electronic equipment .    3.059178999986163
i would therefore recommend to members of parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers ' liability .    2.3595183659810584
we shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result .    3.0351204948781176
mr president , this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars , encourage recycling , and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled .    2.0802620221461936
now who should pay the costs ?    3.1648523115003107
whatever system is adopted , ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer .    2.6669417756473863
the best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars .    2.3832625420865243
the manufacturers have UNK mr florenz and mr lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals .    2.177094178410156
do not be UNK by the car manufacturers !    3.6093861220630234
if you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments .    2.451230023131108
mr president , commissioner , this debate is not a technical debate , contrary to what we may think .    2.9858239306637815
it has become eminently political .    2.6903410185570795
yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate .    2.474378136142386
today , if UNK members of parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers , we should be doing ourselves UNK .    2.725918106925948
in expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end - of - life vehicles , as amendment no 38 stipulates , even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer , parliament would , for the first time , not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of europe , it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies .    2.6913920710013186
we cannot accept this .    3.00958887517623
it would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas .    2.478100573070081
it would also be the first time that the european parliament would be weakening a council position , whereas usually we are UNK that their position is not strong enough .    2.9346828749814686
the free recovery system , for example , for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly .    2.4508703488812547
thus , for the consumer , for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling , the council ' s common position definitely must not be amended . it is , as it stands , perfectly acceptable .    4.292749453792735
mr president , like so many others here today , i believe this is a good measure .    3.4736786595498343
there are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved .    2.718582794590002
we have arrived at the final question .    2.701573610250833
in the first reading debate it was only the economic and monetary affairs committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in parliament . that is quite simply : who pays ?    2.934469561291071
the council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost , not all of it as mr bowis has UNK said .    2.8544295266365554
in fact perhaps as little , the lawyers tell us , as 20 % or one - fifth of the cost . that is not unreasonable .    2.625835386543172
if you look at the uk consumer for example , who UNK a rover , as mr lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the uk and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars , over and above comparable prices in other parts of europe , why should they pay ?    2.4335580021283256
they have paid already .    2.792744954961723
i cannot accept that .    2.8602192993863254
there are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case .    2.8653142254530235
i cannot accept it and i will not vote for it .    3.345073540334383
the responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer .    2.920437097958771
it is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal .    3.2880245591011255
the common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government .    2.8133723189566564
the common position is a reasonable compromise .    3.127184627321046
some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road .    2.51178875186103
i cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of europe i am voting against those amendments .    2.5430977080075645
mr president , there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in europe will properly deal with end - of - life cars , although in this instance the council has not provided a model for a suitable european environment policy .    2.6987976488425867
it is disgraceful the way in which the german presidency handled this matter .    2.6894506102753413
firstly , herr UNK , the environment minister , was not in tune with his colleagues in the cabinet , then chancellor UNK UNK in like a UNK in a china shop , having no expert knowledge of this process .    2.556915469285668
mind you , even the resolution of the finnish council presidency in june was not the best result that could have been done achieved .    2.859143375738588
there are certain weaknesses , the greatest of which , in my opinion , is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses ; after all , the car industry is more than just large companies .    3.4373712965387018
it is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium - sized enterprises .    3.090495618978925
for there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector .    2.660551076527385
the plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and also the amendments in question from our group to article 5 concerning costs .    2.3812585811858877
the common position is also no great UNK from an environmental viewpoint .    2.5999044445283577
it fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow UNK from the greens says that this is the first time that the european parliament has toned down a common position , i really must object , because quite simply , it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern , low - consumption cars such as the 3 - litre car , which contain a great deal of plastic , by means of rigid , high recycling quotas !    2.916779134427132
consequently , we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars .    2.7415651227807154
the objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation .    3.3895444279577602
however , the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing co2 levels in europe in other sectors besides these .    2.511723175116341
mr president , we are indeed now in a very rare situation : those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the council in their common position .    3.0300431992477193
in contrast to what the previous speaker said , i can say i am really proud that a common position was achieved during the finnish presidency to uphold environmental values .    2.9014697179586526
if we UNK away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs , we will be creating a loophole : we will not have created a rational , clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order .    3.2104923132411667
that is why , in my opinion , the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility .    2.934706987521544
only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem , taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future .    2.3532222514925043
mr president , there are two issues of principle in the council ' s draft directive .    3.135446909241477
the first concerns the manufacturer ' s unrestricted liability to take back end - of - life vehicles .    2.023067908131524
this particularly applies in areas within the eu where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles .    2.63682846789622
i believe that , quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned , the eu ' s directives should not treat small companies within the union unfairly .    3.0504038102745556
unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears , for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts .    2.707979792486013
yet the trade in used car parts is important , especially for those who collect and UNK older vehicles .    2.719295218671044
the principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy .    2.8936725670696584
it should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up .    3.0106601514682527
they should be able to establish themselves in new markets , but also to leave old markets .    3.2197129800792568
to bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development .    2.2490277686028883
the second principle in the council ' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive .    3.0543679364876826
it conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product .    2.0274085960781973
to do so also changes the owner ' s liability retroactively .    2.991839787639517
over the years , a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways .    2.8112095431149546
every country within the eu now has rules governing the scrapping of cars .    2.6051572799702165
some may be better than others , and some worse .    2.617149805926444
in anticipation of this eu directive ' s being implemented , eu countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the eu legislation is not applied .    2.5695612611069
this does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds .    2.281362706281381
mr president , everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question .    2.5424420463367206
the common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement , and puts the whole directive at risk .    1.9732014466517125
i therefore maintain that parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument .    3.125484278971245
i would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive ; the costs are not excessive : recycling a car costs less than 1 % of the price of a new car .    2.586604201836961
moreover , the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006 , when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market .    2.868260140783235
as for the remaining vehicles , we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs , as is proposed in amendments nos 44 and 45 by mr lange , the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries , and we should therefore support them .    2.9010545237263385
mr president , this is an extremely bad directive .    2.861229462174628
first of all , as my colleague mr bowis has pointed out , it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle .    3.138340041094111
secondly , it UNK huge costs on the european motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment .    2.4414799600488797
in this parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment .    3.3800085755432825
i suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect , which has not been examined well enough in this debate . it is like so much european legislation .    3.285623723609865
it is far too prescriptive .    2.8766352925903944
it sets in stone one particular model of recycling .    2.288605412549101
the production line was invented about a hundred years ago , i believe , by UNK ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles , to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them .    2.7448664550966937
one thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic UNK of cars .    2.8509146412002426
the plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so .    2.6808930022797477
there is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars , recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non - UNK parts .    2.0951809199427394
this is a very environmentally reasonable approach .    2.6224311070035493
it is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery .    1.9857783620285707
this method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the " dead " car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and UNK process .    2.0287592571806345
i would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive , it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally , and are certainly very damaging economically .    2.904970315859478
mr president , the common position is sound , but it is up to parliament to improve the common position on end - of - life vehicles .    3.140508055285541
the social - democratic group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days .    2.2441969400725426
i would especially draw your attention to amendment no 45 , in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of UNK and recycling at the door of the manufacturer , for new cars at any rate .    3.03467091452637
consequently , consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production .    2.7679393175805354
for the cars currently on the road , it would be reasonable to share the cost , for example by setting up a fund such as that in the netherlands .    3.2811086432533787
the common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost , they should also take back end - of - life vehicles .    2.5093310160141726
this is a big problem in my opinion .    3.256866071447905
i urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles , as they would gain an excessive hold over the second - hand components market .    2.510872460531361
they would then determine their own prices .    2.5116014567631115
anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur UNK .    3.3043857210467236
the european consumer organisation , which has asked us to support the common position on this point , is to my mind letting the consumer down .    3.568561186809442
a second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers ' UNK is the cost of transport .    2.80382840692706
if car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies , this will UNK transporting end - of - life vehicles over long distances .    2.2170010409665606
this is environmentally UNK but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either .    2.3681072089949065
i would therefore appreciate your support for amendment no 45 .    2.3281618836879416
mr president , commissioner , i have asked to speak again so that i can say a few more words at the close of this debate .    2.6728316056520462
if you travel to the netherlands , you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost - free .    2.500662871515788
you will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of , that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials , that 85 % of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92 % of all cars in the netherlands are recycled .    2.3942157502601646
this is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes .    2.79716838625292
should this be condemned ecologically , UNK UNK ?    3.1547467018759905
i do not think so .    2.283480982015855
the netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or , in the case of end - of - life vehicles currently driving around , the manufacturer , has nothing , absolutely nothing , to do with UNK ; it is a simple question of competition !    2.8174828878697413
the issue here is whether a european manufacturer should pay eur 250 million or a UNK manufacturer , say , eur 2 million .    2.331946137169862
in terms of the people who build cars here in europe , i am in favour of not making competition unequal but , in terms of environmental protection , i want freedom from costs for the last owner , to be financed by a special fund , and manufacturer responsibility for new cars , which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars !    3.1764019261480363
( applause from the pse group )    2.3025396186211906
mr president , the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages , mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re - use , the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials , etc . i think we have tabled a sound proposal .    2.7238708172205257
the main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer , the vendor , or whoever , should take the end - of - life vehicle back without any cost .    2.315791410740312
i will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems .    2.569212275544774
we have reached an agreement with all the parties involved .    3.4720894177728323
these include car manufacturers , second - hand car dealers , the federation of the car industry , the UNK processing firms , shredding firms and the government .    2.417320503356989
an environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis .    2.4259852291447856
the car industry - and belgium produces a great many cars - did not have any problem with that .    2.7082216302183864
UNK can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost .    2.5579313743392804
in connection with this , we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well .    2.9753956285388874
some businesses have become hi - tech businesses , because they managed to recycle certain materials , even materials which are not yet included in the directive .    2.6352562580974634
so this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain .    2.540056933612229
i am in favour of collection free of charge .    2.51979886897997
it worked for us .    2.783143862038829
why would it not work elsewhere ?    2.78003303163922
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented .    2.4802777597969126
would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes .    2.2802242229994123
allow me briefly to comment on some of the UNK and principles behind the present directive .    3.5444119310353273
allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate .    2.8795405237058187
first of all , i think i should repeat some of the basic facts which mr florenz and others have already mentioned .    3.0123126172327894
what we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the european union , resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste .    2.776904911497265
this means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars , and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open .    2.3057584726344533
moreover , they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind .    2.416727768227312
approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars , but also cadmium , chromium , mercury and other very dangerous substances .    2.7268122908452135
this is something you already know , but i would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening .    3.172914443664908
cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in europe .    2.951196423511186
we know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it , and there is no excuse for not taking action .    3.005222685348909
the present directive has three aims . first of all , we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars .    2.757900738774101
secondly , we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable .    3.863753841578103
we can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product ' s life - cycle . instead , we should avoid creating so much waste .    2.7095278883335596
we should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product .    2.6148599421253964
thirdly , we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive .    3.4158582509917235
this is , of course , because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled .    3.233141185853339
it is , above all , the manufacturer ' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car ' s life - cycle .    2.6330610812034916
two important questions have arisen in this regard . yes , there are in fact more than two questions , but i want to mention just two of the most important .    3.6649905211606666
first of all : who should pay ?    2.6763630044997964
and secondly : are we reducing the european car industry ' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal ?    2.8801692964484507
the first question , then , is about who should pay .    2.9634013304553357
the directive states that the polluter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the eu ' s treaty concerning the manufacturer ' s liability .    3.177820409003699
we have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car .    2.8426761350868563
do we imagine , then , that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive ?    3.366801018787282
no . clearly , we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment , but it will be very much greater .    4.0805328203769
moreover , the cost will have to be borne in the future .    3.5864405336274388
the cost will not therefore disappear , but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed .    2.6559409060578973
are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis ?    2.5738069680613695
is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it ?    2.579114350130277
is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these ?    2.466908016679025
is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the european car industry ?    2.6406696695694962
no , of course not .    3.8005897621901514
it is quite the opposite .    2.8192615913094414
do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel - efficient cars is going to decline in the future ?    2.5215671262765977
what kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars ?    2.564049629925197
naturally , that they should be environmentally friendly , that they should be recyclable , that they should be fuel - efficient and that they should not pollute our environment .    3.0031278623830895
it is , of course , only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry .    3.179139102648807
we must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste , recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel - efficient cars .    2.8145753742646633
the fact that we have a european car industry which has already made great UNK more than properly UNK for the fact that there are , in fact , a good many cars on european roads for which they must take responsibility .    3.2741961988579558
the cost is not insurmountable ; nor is the task an impossible one .    2.4408815697081376
if we develop motive power of the kind i have described , i am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload .    2.5913817531977457
these will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems .    2.008582210746897
the industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in europe .    2.692868058859813
they will not represent an insurmountable cost for the european car industry .    2.98166599453446
they will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel - efficient cars .    2.225705355200011
we must do this for the sake of the environment .    3.0565339870866812
the costs will not disappear . nor will the waste disappear .    2.326470160717402
but , otherwise , we must all of us , as taxpayers or citizens , foot the bill . what is more , the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action .    2.607185559369105
that is what i should like to say by way of introduction .    3.343774773669165
i also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation .    3.4654166793221246
if we assume that , on average , a car has a life of eleven years , do members , indeed does anyone , believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem ?    2.3576822300121845
do you think that , when we legislate about chemicals , we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future ?    3.790503512188219
clearly , we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars .    3.000502290252264
it is still not an insurmountable problem .    2.761409773274305
we already have an infrastructure .    2.7056732898933675
we have what we require in order to deal with end - of - life cars .    2.943365631649343
i naturally hope that the result of today ' s vote will be a good one .    4.032027265296351
if i have not already done so , i would also thank mr karl - heinz florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .    2.735069459178403
in fact , it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to re - use and manufacturer ' s liability .    2.9997268241188855
i believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment .    2.8777855532194105
we cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters .    2.4724668277733053
as i have said , we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues .    3.134451755906601
after the first reading in the european parliament in 1999 , the commission ' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the council .    3.8340342987423
however , we obtained a well - balanced common position in july during the finnish presidency .    2.4607704449716046
now , we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully .    3.695476553694908
a total of 48 amendments have been tabled .    3.144373727341239
the commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety .    2.4445240633488132
three amendments can be partially approved , and one can be approved in principle .    2.5588475209475052
certain amendments concern improvements to the commission ' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the council has removed .    2.9575503772087677
these amendments can all be approved .    2.7400470897429314
amendments nos 6 and 21 are new ; the commission can approve these .    2.635746509469019
the commission can also approve amendment no 26 with certain UNK changes .    2.405628996298389
i want to emphasise that a number of the other amendments affecting the proposal ' s basic components involve a considerable watering - down of the level of environmental protection aimed at by the common position .    2.565843587217608
they cannot therefore be approved .    2.8487730491431726
parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in europe .    2.3620421993429015
it would UNK and UNK me if it were not to do so today .    3.6963254000111694
i am very concerned about certain amendments from parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question .    2.4377232218864138
these concern , for example , the phasing - out of heavy metals , manufacturer ' s liability and the requirement for recycling .    2.563877454316454
i want to deal with these amendments on a group - by - group basis .    2.8752243339194536
amendments nos 4 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 concern the phasing - out of heavy metals .    2.078777930264395
amendment no 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force .    2.311589665909721
amendments nos 13 , 28 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions .    2.0082759942009996
this would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly .    2.731594453409029
amendments nos 4 , 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling .    2.403112397317024
the commission considers that the type of phasing - out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view .    2.565388583716067
amendments nos 17 , 18 , 27 , 34 , 36 , 38 , 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer ' s liability .    2.291777433135811
the compromise reached by the council is fair but fragile .    3.321752470373804
the commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without , at the same time , creating tensions .    2.8179787220279566
i regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the commission being wrongly used , so creating uncertainty about the commission ' s attitude to the issue .    2.6299037685954194
i want to emphasise that , as early as 1997 , the commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer ' s liability and that the commission entirely supports the common position .    3.346760723592818
this does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers . far from it .    2.1576826641020546
amendments nos 39 , 40 , 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives .    2.2098707444078634
the high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed .    2.9327022651950516
these amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise .    2.706962321934311
allow me also - listen carefully to what i am saying now , because i have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and " UNK " cars as mentioned in amendments nos 3 , 7 , and 9 , section 2 , and 35 .    2.820774702143779
so , whatever has been stated in this regard , vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive .    2.379880140503195
we do not consider that amendments nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive .    2.725810536649024
this is not covered by the directive .    3.1621056213298275
an ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the european parliament and the council .    3.1062121763438015
amendments nos 29 , 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles .    2.2308087766604716
there is a danger of amendments nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic , tyres and glass .    2.228987113210515
finally , the commission cannot approve amendments nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity ; nor amendment no 19 , which the commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage .    2.845046383451795
furthermore , amendment no 43 does not fall within the directive ' s area of applicability .    2.6532520519713705
thank you very much , commissioner .    1.9725151098002782
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
we shall now proceed to the vote .    2.0168894393738306
vote    3.1522193301854244
madam president , as you know , the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors , particularly in the french version .    2.554350387998841
you have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which i have had dealings recently .    3.0385247072712573
there is an error which has still not been UNK and that is on amendment no 4 .    3.3498774864060454
in the english version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations .    2.300298083275558
in the french version that becomes ' entreprises UNK et organisations UNK ' .    2.1283208403903706
could you please make sure that french - speaking members of this house know that the word entreprises is not correct .    2.7157477855720082
it should not be in the amendment .    3.5748974373279134
and , again , i urge you , madam president , to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently .    3.483308296438062
madame mcnally , in general , i am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations .    2.8215245805345175
i shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution .    2.7455734067443642

we consider the english version to be the original text .    3.1382599473638626
to give you an example , in both paragraphs 4 and 5 of the dutch and german versions , the equivalents of the english words : " in so far as " have been omitted .    2.5233492804585342
this is why i would ask you to consider the english version as the original version .    2.743868837239465
thank you , mr van velzen .    2.8486050764872113
in response i shall say the same thing i said to mrs mcnally just now .    2.637621134186589
i am very concerned about these translation problems which , unfortunately , we seem to be having increasingly , and i can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed .    2.9998153696830667

mcnally report ( a5 - UNK / 1999 )    3.40545979849624
- ( fr ) i am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the commission entitled ' women and science ' .    2.965267158149955
in this document , the commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in europe .    2.8333014228414335
this objective deserves our total support .    2.527346746581449
expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the european union , after agriculture and the structural funds .    3.1180300369664447
the various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between UNK in various member states .    2.1408190015545814
relatively few women , however , are active in scientific UNK despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies .    2.447428165446893
it is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented .    3.1767658371557235
i am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the european commission .    3.5527965902273393
the commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at community level , especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , which is quite obviously something i approve of .    2.877828111260539
the goal for the years to come is to increase women ' s participation to achieve a rate of 40 % female participation in the marie UNK grants , in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .    2.3181437619187726
in order to do so , it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various member states , to set up a coordinating body to implement a ' women and science ' monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women ' s participation in research activities .    2.496184809380576
furthermore , like the rapporteur , i think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields .    3.154231947024873
improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles .    2.692352301946837
we will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy .    2.356604928245824
the european parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .    2.8027119634488162
we must incorporate the gender factor in science , research and all other european union policies , in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market .    2.522111289875113
in its communication " women and science " , the european commission informs us of its good intentions of UNK the support of women to enrich research in europe .    2.8278635207472114
the fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the european union .    2.6509307264908126
we know that we can change this situation , in which women are underrepresented in the science sector , only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and , when they have obtained their degrees , by means of positive measures at the professional level .    2.5616488576916554
having said this , some of our fellow members clearly have UNK because the report by the committee on women ' s rights and equal opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40 % female participating in research in europe .    2.5218367269521176
this is patently not the case , since such a quota would not be realistic .    2.9824424381841377
indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved .    2.493272272956552
to set my fellow members ' minds at ease and to reassure them , i have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the commission , in its communication , undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women ' s participation in community research programmes , which is , after all , a praiseworthy goal .    3.060448961870073
and why should we not note that the commission ' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40 % minimum level to be a crucial goal for women ' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes ?    3.194119331188245
it is not a quota !    3.018569716685814
it is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the commission , insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of member states .    2.645577317456211
the latter would be well advised , however , to follow the good example of the commission , for once , and make the same efforts in their own research programmes .    3.300025241547858
people must realise this !    2.8212863983162055
i am pleased to see that the debate on mrs mcnally ' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women ' s participation in professions in research and science , met with a fairly wide consensus .    2.6906354187572648
on this subject , any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable , and i can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women : to enjoy equal access to scientific study , to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence , and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly , enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career .    2.5312303960980578
this necessary realistic and pragmatic policy , however , which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must , as far as we are concerned , necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity , which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject .    3.1620893802805523
our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values , which truly respect gender differences , not on some UNK sexual equality , which has its own UNK contradictions . in any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy , based on the use of quotas , contrary to the idea of citizenship which the members of parliament in the uen group set great store by , and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by mrs mcnally ' s report , namely women ' s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit .    2.503517713254951
by having the opportunity to show their true merit , by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women , and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege , women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish . in this way they will succeed in UNK balances which are still not in their favour .    2.520664577735974
since the european parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms , and in spite of the general approach which i approve for the most part , i can do no other than abstain from the vote on mrs mcnally ' s report .    2.749873457543272
second reading of the florenz report ( a5 - 0006 / 2000 )    2.751276621933556
i have rejected the entire directive , not least because amendment no 34 to article 12 and the amendments to article 5 / 4 have not received an adequate majority here in the house .    2.3541948185384944
i come from a country which manufactures 50 % of the cars in the eu and it is precisely the free collection of end - of - life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable .    3.0483750080786285
here , in my opinion , the labour market is also considerably UNK by the costs arising to these companies .    3.0819126150672473
this cannot be a good thing in a european union where we are ever mindful of employment .    3.23223462190384
i consider that this is a serious UNK and that , in principle , it does not UNK our legal system .    4.1868331583810745
in my opinion , this directive is unacceptable for this reason .    3.2515609170214947
madam president , i would like to comment on the florenz report .    2.5029708270909476
i think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the council has been toned down , the major groups here ( and above all the german delegates of the major groups ) have not , thank god , succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive , namely manufacturer responsibility .    3.0861273369747964
unfortunately , there has been a UNK down of the effective ecological material flow policy , i . e . through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years .    2.293484185749556
we know that lead , mercury , cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made .    1.8564772014401154
here , unfortunately , the european parliament has UNK to the interests of industry .    4.392143637697738
i am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of florenz , lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end - of - life vehicles .    2.055106020357984
i found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and i am pleased that it failed , that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large member state did not gain a majority , by which i mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the european parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries .    2.7857372257469977
madam president , although i too have spent most of my life in fast cars , i agree with my colleague , mr florenz , that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included .    2.866695992246564
these splendid cars do not constitute waste .    2.388272995415347
that is why i voted in favour of the amendments .    2.8750084050112736
neither can we UNK what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country ' s statutes to another ' s .    2.34764484982891
in this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations .    2.168614495454189
we cannot forget old car enthusiasts either , of whom there are more than 50 000 in finland alone .    2.2660072690114736
they are involved in low - profile work of valuable cultural importance .    2.36008452489032
- ( sv ) the parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing , to say the least .    2.300746987596193
before the vote at the plenary sitting , new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the committee .    2.933526449651521
in the divided situation which has now arisen , we therefore consider that the council ' s wordings are the best .    2.982804042092245
we need a directive in this area , and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure .    2.9532385881067573
the directive concerning end - of - life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation .    2.493993808244449
it is therefore important that the manufacturer ' s liability should be clear . this should not in any way be jeopardised .    2.8979309663886985
today , parliament is examining , for the last time , this text on ' end - of - life ' vehicles and what is to be done with them : their destruction , a commendable intention with regard to our environment .    3.0026438210773008
first of all , who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction ?    2.9815873604556016
we must all ensure that it is not always the same person , i . e . the vehicle owner , who pays .    2.9436444798011614
he or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle , which is a UNK UNK in financial terms .    3.066617814202374
we have recently had cause to talk about the ' polluter pays ' principle . we should apply this principle rationally and calmly , correctly targeted and without ideology .    2.2217128550307543
another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope .    2.5517746630857623
one might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point , but i feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts .    3.6581901520175863
so let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these UNK of the UNK industry .    3.6564333303772103
these old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by europe , if we are not to water down each of our specific identities .    2.642050482507145
there is no lack of examples amongst european texts , and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision .    2.7346553237823823
i only need to mention the case of directives 79 / UNK and 92 / 43 .    2.685127946848227
the precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis .    2.5158544667986598
it is not the job of the mep to generate UNK or legal proceedings for judges in any arena . that would not be fulfilling our mission .    2.3090006723432333
on the contrary , we must adopt crystal - clear texts in order to limit legal disputes .    2.8269455962725787
.    2.489189446364389
( nl ) that the florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement .    2.3628934391509855
i regret that the manufacturers have UNK the european parliament and the council with a whole UNK of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false .    2.779301913732465
i dare say this because i took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from , among others , scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully .    2.2213215897377228
they made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety , for example , are UNK .    3.1932792565083634
the car lobby was unsuccessful today and i am pleased about that .    2.817455342495141
the directive remains in place .    2.6303990547173086
i expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements .    2.8471517503962693
- my party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments .    2.5684947392233015
there are few things more certain in life than taxes , death and pollution .    2.072624745945496
when it comes to pollution , like sin , we are all against it , but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good .    2.4194998704259465
in fact , this directive , like so many others addressing environmental issues , is not good .    3.007540843673212
as is so often the case , it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem , which will only serve to create more jobs for officials , and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money .    2.4693648072314316
no one , not least my party , could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged , but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market , not to create another bureaucratic UNK .    3.3078947743228753
thus , a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles , to encourage private sector recycling companies , through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements , and to incentivise the use of recycled materials .    2.3193338520189344
of course , these are areas where the eu does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction .    2.710678942565964
however , in the absence of these powers , it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure .    2.73739394586736
instead , it should leave member states to develop their own systems , and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good .    3.164757196167145
berger report ( a5 - 0007 / 2000 )    2.6356945073077123
this proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third - country nationals , for the provision of cross - border services .    2.810143537479854
third - country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one member state do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the european union .    2.60360493550426
until now , the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the union of non - community workers have been very harsh .    3.2553730631608797
it is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the european union is being made easier , even when they are nationals of third countries .    2.8054232870435345
this means that this proposal ' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers , but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services .    2.955336684642035
on the other hand , for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the berger report , one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any member state .    2.8347870334412617
berger report ( a5 - 0007 / 2000 ) and berger report ( a5 - 0012 / 2000 )    2.633016450992759
basically , these proposals introduce the eu service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a european union member state to provide services in other member states , a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits .    2.780904815023367
the first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a member state which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another member state on a temporary basis to provide services there .    2.5456139418558883
according to the terms of the directive , the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned .    2.748535591545054
logically , in order to be given such a card , the employee must be legally resident in a member states and must be covered by a social security scheme .    3.1658631005645335
the second proposal grants the same rights to self - employed workers who are third country nationals .    2.41679094323383
while , basically , i subscribe to the european commission proposals , nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion .    3.036636920346397
that is why i am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .    2.869305164257501
this will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any UNK !    2.778962772755132
other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures , for example by authorising member states to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards .    2.7926046321664852
i feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions .    2.6976797686486917
i can , therefore , only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended . we could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the european union had to face so many problems .    2.638793364400531
this goes against the fundamental principle of non - discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this union .    2.5784483215986156
marinho report ( a5 - 0003 / 2000 ) :    3.222982627747525
we have serious reservations about the council ' s proposed amendments .    2.9980839297253827
how can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the court of first instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that court because it is UNK ?    3.476056861153484
the first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter .    2.9246025357910233
some people will say that UNK is not a realistic aim , but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them :    2.9688141599045426
on 1 january 1995 , the council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in article 17 of the accession treaty of 24 june 1994 .    2.9424368722034475
in may 1995 , during the preparatory phase of the treaty of amsterdam , the cfi , concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases , was already insisting on the need to take measures ' without which the court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role . in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial . '    2.8328289205023904
so what was done at amsterdam ?    2.5905444018804236
in that respect , nothing . on the contrary , extending the community ' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden .    2.7567464368982537
you will agree , furthermore , that the texts adopted by this house always call for community jurisdiction , and that includes for the charter of fundamental rights which is currently being drawn up .    3.0694958997729915
the increase in the number of cfi judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere UNK , grudgingly granted , which we have become aware of after the fact .    2.294664271804262
consequently , these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake . they represent a downward UNK which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred .    2.750660138320692
we cannot agree to this , since such a UNK shift towards a europe of the judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our states .    2.5161760984262664
the time has come , we feel , for in - depth consideration of how to put the community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice .    2.6339276692561477
this question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity .    2.3529503639840557
is the forthcoming intergovernmental conference not the ideal opportunity for this ?    2.641878809752046
dimitrakopoulos and leinen report ( a5 - 0018 / 2000 )    2.581885979871229
- ( sv ) the most important task of the approaching intergovernmental conference is to reform the eu before the accession of the new member states .    2.7860751028773576
we therefore , of course , support the european parliament ' s now giving the formal go - ahead to the intergovernmental conference .    2.438123252745262
we nonetheless consider that the agenda for the intergovernmental conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place .    3.152971714737978
we also argued this in november 1999 , and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 november 1999 .    2.69118386656926
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) in the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , the european parliament calls for a " constitutional process to be launched " .    3.0186597176413477
this determination to UNK nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so - called charter of fundamental rights , which is really a UNK constitution .    2.8416881598135775
it is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the european parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in austria .    2.7705683603277156
the same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the commission for the intergovernmental conference .    2.8155893026510515
the key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority , of states and peoples , in order to increase the commission ' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority states .    2.7898429824761837
incidentally , the french will probably be interested to learn that the commission is asking for article 67 of the amsterdam treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the european parliament .    2.9471644528351257
people will remember that this article , dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the community level , stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the council and thereafter the council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system .    2.97512660507808
in france , both in the national assembly and in the senate , when this was being ratified , many members of the french parliament were reassured to hear that , in any case , the council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision - making .    3.251469304168185
well , today , the same minister of european affairs who drew up the treaty of amsterdam , who has , in the meantime , become a european commissioner , mr barnier , proposes to decide , at the forthcoming igc , that the council will operate in these areas by majority decision .    3.5207863279629783
this is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of european integration with the brussels institutions .    2.2756810461263597
the french must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making , but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent .    2.508974625977998
if they yield , they are lost .    3.06377065987128
for it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one .    2.595673277001083
. ( da ) the danish social democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the intergovernmental conference .    2.4537438273776715
it is crucial for us that it should be possible for this intergovernmental conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities , such as the weighting of votes in the council of ministers and the composition of the commission and the european parliament , which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the eu .    3.4797052871978007
an unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process .    2.4580011700871993
that is something we do not want to see , and we have therefore voted against any such extension .    3.7013074927672354
we nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the intergovernmental conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding .    3.1725731351806417
.    2.489189446364389
( sv ) we are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the intergovernmental conference at the helsinki conference .    2.9888478940079497
possible future member states ought to be involved in , and have an influence upon , the shaping of the eu of the future .    3.1366911473274417
the elections to the european parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist eu centred upon brussels .    2.704883009852529
with the convening of the forthcoming igc , the process of european union is topical once again .    3.4570927414726036
once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the heads of state and government .    2.765416672997317
in other words , fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide , behind closed doors , on the fate of more than 350 million individuals .    2.7014937781738273
it is therefore easy to understand the public ' s lack of interest , given the construction of europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them .    2.957148764871187
in fact , one only need look at the agenda of the igc : the institutions , enlargement and european defence .    2.7969967136948313
the fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power , the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of eastern europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of europe , particularly by increasing military budgets .    2.7729383183889613
social europe , used as a UNK by the eu , has simply been eliminated from the agenda .    3.314287446740624
all this does is to UNK the development , on the european scale , of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers ' main claims towards the highest common denominator .    2.5174136882469265
this is why i am voting against the report .    2.6070163713736325
i voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the igc . i did so because it sums up the philosophy of the portuguese presidency , which is supported by a broad majority in parliament , of opening up the igc agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between member states , large and small , as was originally stated when the helsinki council was UNK .    2.758664638580652
unfortunately , in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for UNK to the treaty on european union , nothing has so far been stated about the need to review article 7 , which deals with suspending a state in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the " founding " principles of the union , as laid down in article 6 .    3.261581491449462
as the present crisis involving austria has demonstrated , the union has the right to protect itself .    3.115450309821201
nevertheless , the legal mechanisms that exist in the treaty are weak , difficult to apply politically and legally , do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance . suspending a state is just such a process , and is to be condemned .    2.816805876560172
i therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the igc agenda , and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the treaties .    2.9958670452475724
we feel that at present the central issues about convening an intergovernmental conference to amend the treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda . they are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered , and more important than the controversy over the extent of parliament ' s participation in it .    2.561611231832884
we feel that these issues result from the igc ' s appropriateness and its objectives , as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there .    2.5548300806881272
we have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the igc because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged .    2.2286254637256127
these are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us .    3.454694077843854
- the european parliamentary labour party has abstained on the final vote on the leinen dimitrakopoulos report .    2.6486588758428042
the text is overambitious , and britain ' s labour meps believe that the igc should primarily deal with the " amsterdam left - overs " in order to prepare for enlargement , and not expand far beyond these .    2.732483254389784
there is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the eu institutions .    3.3016911650279996
expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de - stabilisation .    2.8513034008354663
the key factor in this text as it has been amended , is the call for a charter of fundamental rights to be incorporated into the treaties .    3.350076329641288
in our view , this would bring with it a complex legislative burden , and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are .    2.8715724083840755
our priorities ( i . e . the " left - overs " ) must be :    2.431116243391727
the number and responsibilities of commissioners    3.0299944716306304
weighting of votes in the council    3.652861504709025
extension of qmv in areas where it will benefit the uk and europe ( but not treaty change , defence matters , border controls or taxation ) , and extension of codecision wherever qmv is extended    2.037968048544826
beyond this , we have concerns that the " flexibility " or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present .    2.484398527921376
the provisions of amsterdam are largely UNK and allowing more scope for opt - outs could weaken the eu at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other european legislation .    2.29173762844608
- ( sv ) in order to be able to influence developments , the european parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the intergovernmental conference than emerges from the present resolution , which displays far too much disappointment and UNK about the decision which the european council made in helsinki in december 1999 .    3.043720924131013
the european parliament and its committee on constitutional affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the council decision in helsinki , so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion , including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the european union and their financial interests .    3.215211904877231
we swedish christian democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the eu to the east if the agenda for the intergovernmental conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the intergovernmental conference in amsterdam in 1997 .    2.7073479571200254
the most important task of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference is to reform the eu before the accession of the new member states .    2.9529464650454043
i therefore , of course , support the european parliament ' s now giving the formal go - ahead to the intergovernmental conference .    2.4317329311325495
i nonetheless consider that the agenda for the intergovernmental conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place .    3.223392670530243
i also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 november 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence .    1.9969816276702188
joint resolution on austria    3.7951514877799055
madam president , the union for a europe of nations group did not associate itself with the joint ppe / de - pse resolution on the political situation in austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and jörg haider ' s freedom party .    2.3261308017700313
this ppe / de - pse resolution UNK the initiative taken by fourteen member states to apply pressure to austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott .    2.355599465214585
what we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the treaty , as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact , in this instance , have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples .    2.5297884813734366
whatever jörg haider ' s UNK excesses , which we of course deplore , the austrians have made a democratic choice , and we must respect this .    3.180798311999782
in our opinion , it is clear that the left wing in the european parliament , in association with the austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena , have UNK a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately UNK period .    2.528784221321351
although UNK haider to hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever , it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in UNK some ppe / de members of parliament .    2.1729143707452723
but , going beyond this petty political operation , what the majority in the european parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left - right UNK in austria , which caused political life to stagnate and UNK , may soon spread to the european system of co - management which is producing equally appalling results .    2.766361305975043
in order to prevent this threat to the system , it is ready to do anything , including UNK the outcome of free elections , including setting up a thought police , including establishing a new form of totalitarianism .    2.924805040648451
is this UNK spontaneous ?    2.796268681138911
is it the product of mere foolishness or , more probably , of a deliberate strategy , which is the same throughout the world ?    2.939958113675692
who is imposing their will on the nations of europe , daring to stop them choosing their own fate ?    2.3337999731601964
underground networks ?    3.1712899404306416
the government of the united states , or of israel ?    3.6150040820171108
or their socialist back - up troops who , in this house , have the UNK to thrust their values down our UNK ?    3.010150078299388
what , then , are the values of these socialists who UNK their electoral UNK in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in UNK UNK for the benefit of the UNK , and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants , full - time union officials and state UNK ?    3.087854391025308
what are the values of the belgian socialist party , which only goes from UNK scandals to corruption scandals , via UNK and UNK ?    2.4706949971906322
what are the values of the french socialist party , which UNK money from all the town councils under its UNK in the UNK , UNK and UNK scandals ?    3.470119259979634
the party led by UNK UNK , UNK with the UNK of UNK UNK ' s UNK government , the party whose leading lights have just been caught red - handed once again , living a life of luxury on the public funds UNK from the students ' mutual insurance company .    2.9740005634517828
i shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the italian socialist party , because it does not do to UNK a man when he is down , still less when he is dead and gone .    2.621923660499856
i shall , however , mention the spanish socialist party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of UNK and which settled its accounts with basque nationalists by UNK contract UNK .    2.41074556927821
i shall also mention the german socialist party which UNK to preach to us about the second world war , when it is international socialist in the way that its UNK were national socialists , still goose - stepping , the party of the waffen ss .    2.426464077328672
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.799445241956104
madam president , i had a major problem with this resolution .    2.902084983450158
finally , i abstained on the vote for a number of reasons .    3.125926275218035
i was in sympathy with the edd group amendment , talking about rejecting the interference of the eu in the formation of governments of members states but i had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia , racism , etc . and i felt that it might be misinterpreted .    2.4066314869722025
however , i do wonder about the wisdom of this .    2.5119767026321194
firstly , there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long - term consequences of that .    2.8794131767546713
i also wonder about the wisdom of the eu and its reaction to the formation of the government in austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there .    2.6991219891125593
at the moment it seems that the haider party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments .    2.196379190231054
even america has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations .    2.7774001638327
we wonder if this is actually feeding the UNK of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it .    3.049840670219914
i really think that people should be extremely cautious .    2.6252307929045773
if you want to combat xenophobia and racism , and i believe that we should , we need to look at the root causes .    3.8018368663912945
we need to look at the people who vote for these parties , and understand why this situation arises .    2.794563266593786
it is not a situation that most people in this parliament want , but we need to be careful about the approach we take , so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve .    3.7962795560337286
madam president , i strongly refute any statement , demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism .    2.015878752262489
i passionately defend europe ' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law .    2.9202069684327823
i disagree , however , for this very reason , with the UNK actions taken by the presidency - the portuguese presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional UNK on behalf of the other fourteen states .    3.7330460761440802
this is not the way to fight extremism .    3.0382980953218044
it may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good .    2.960400497924782
the UNK of confusion and UNK actions that has been unleashed over austria has UNK things out of all proportion . it has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and UNK risks that had previously not even been considered .    2.2124460625842515
there is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law , but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the austrians and UNK roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law , in this case the standards laid down in the treaties .    2.9225922619586275
what are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an intergovernmental conference ?    2.4311068276471968
a europe of 27 states or a europe of 14 , or even fewer ?    3.1725549738207626
we support europe , a europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point , a europe which respects the treaties and the law and a europe which needs austria .    3.077577346895161
this needs to be said !    3.902806230333643
madam president , i am delighted and proud that this parliament has , by an enormous majority , condemned the formation of the coalition in austria incorporating mr haider ' s freedom party .    2.497629460160016
mr haider has demonstrated , over the past years by both words and deeds , that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse .    2.5360172822540936
not only has he admired adolf hitler , praised the waffen ss , and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four roma , but also in carinthia has been a member of the regional government .    2.3442838894884876
he has led efforts to end provision for austria ' s slovene - speaking minority and assistance to immigrants .    2.2603971092466923
some have said it is not right for us to interfere in austrian politics .    3.268453291030838
they are wrong .    3.0980308979660873
european union treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights .    2.3031359355524015
some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections .    3.7690055527363184
however , democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy .    2.6443492316783552
there is the tragic UNK of the holocaust , the death of 6 million jews , to those who argued the same case with respect to germany in the 1930s .    2.544619883670377
however , we should not condemn mr haider for ambition .    2.7940301804273986
UNK do not change their spots .    2.90222095744448
the real UNK are austria ' s christian democrat acting as UNK goats to UNK a threat to europe that we thought had died berlin in UNK .    2.443075245031402
madam president , we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of jörg haider ' s freedom party in austria , which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part , and which sends our support to anti - racist groups within the democratic majority of the austrian people .    2.767047300199111
we warn that this coalition , if it is formed today , unacceptably UNK the extreme right , directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation , which bring us together in this european union .    2.5675181988076257
these are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us .    2.716572947654707
this european parliament requires the european commission to be vigilant of any racist action in austria , and threatens to suspend austria from membership of the european union if this happens .    3.128056448472926
i am proud to support such a resolution .    2.434342173521359
though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any austrian government representative to this european parliament has not carried today , i give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this european parliament to combat the return of neo - nazis to government in europe can and will be taken .    2.899921996005446
i shall take the floor very briefly , madam president .    3.0281565679471214
i respect parliament ' s wish , as it has been expressed , but i must also say that the self - determination of peoples cannot be called into question , even by the european parliament .    3.867671165359928
the document is unfair both to austrian members of the european parliament , and to members of the austrian national parliament , and it smacks slightly of UNK and political interests , but also of business .    3.9202874632195037
i do not believe that these signals will change the citizens ' indifference to europe .    2.3694824540113113
the austrian extreme right has been UNK an unwarranted present .    2.7692133045291003
i very much welcome the position taken by the italian radicals ; and i say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between italian liberals and austrian liberals .    2.127960389337436
i have for many years , in word and deed , been committed to the anti - fascist struggle and the UNK for equal rights and against xenophobia . however , recent events - firstly , what were really threats by the council of ministers , then mr prodi ' s threats against the austrian commissioner and , finally , the present decision - are things i cannot support .    2.5145024357767904
i have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though i agree with many of its premises . what we have here , first and foremost , is an incredibly UNK mixture of power , arrogance and impotence on the part of the european union .    2.8443968428307915
not only do these decisions conflict with the treaty and apportion to the institutions of the union more power than that to which they are entitled but , worst of all , their effect will be counter - productive .    2.7506462988425175
they will not weaken mr haider and the fpö . on the contrary , they will strengthen them .    2.897529073701464
we shall obtain the very opposite of what we want .    3.0479126832168
that is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right .    2.370315738969142
the left ' s members of parliament therefore supported the liberal decision ' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in austria or elsewhere .    2.441127864632797
we attach crucial importance to applying , if necessary , the new provisions under article 7 of the amsterdam treaty so that a country which , by its actions , UNK fundamental citizens ' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the eu ' s council of ministers removed .    2.9934981231818463
- ( el ) the freedom party ' s participation in the austrian government is a dangerous development for the european union ' s political future .    3.229893740130206
it is a ' trojan horse ' which is unfortunately UNK in europe larger than ever since the second world war .    2.3695347940907254
the european parliament and the union ' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes UNK of nazism and advocates of xenophobia .    2.555895339919752
the european union bears a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movements , the social democrats and the christian democrats - because , by their UNK adherence to the harsh financial policies of emu , their UNK of the welfare state and their UNK of uncontrolled competition , they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right - wing extremists of the haider type to recruit support for their neo - nazi ways .    2.2629353556494047
   3.702094057753363
in view of the fact that the rules of procedure of the european parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning haider ' s party , as well as all the parties throughout europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers , we voted in favour of the compromise resolution . we did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms , in order to show our solidarity with all those in austria itself who are opposing the austrian extreme right and its demagoguery .    2.801094344237696
our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution , their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious .    2.172608129671024
some of these parties , despite declaring themselves to be UNK and democratic , adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right , either out of UNK or as a vote - winning UNK , if only in openly and hypocritically UNK the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment , and generally making their lives more difficult .    2.2602038444722106
more generally , those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various states of the european union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy , devoted exclusively to the interests of big business , has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it UNK , and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right .    2.516590238229319
this week we heard the first political cry of the new - born europe .    2.5805800501786944
by staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of jörg haider ' s xenophobic and anti - european party in the austrian government , a situation without precedent since the second world war , the european union has come into its political UNK and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial community , a large market , a " europe of shopkeepers " .    2.8885014831150615
it is a part of its future which is at stake right now , part of its very essence , its heart and soul .    2.9340614037868633
the european parliament was the first to speak up .    3.3715882998693645
the appeal by the european socialists , on the initiative of olivier UNK , raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this UNK of and intolerable situation .    2.9775072516653567
a firm attitude which the 14 european states have demonstrated unanimously and promptly , through mr guterres , by condemning the risk of the austrian political situation getting out of control .    2.130857078773185
this courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of europe .    2.268667358206789
a return to the roots , at last , for a community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history UNK by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance .    2.3809102659766594
europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events .    2.716183346907035
however , as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will , since the sanctions stipulated under article 7 of the treaties are virtually impossible to apply , will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure ?    2.785126206342642
the whole credibility of europe is at stake today , before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow .    2.3661225862147806
from now on europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition .    2.4718332753032906
at this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo - nazis in the government of a european union member state , i must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone .    2.9222210055190745
i am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the european parliament , after its excellent political debate yesterday , should not adopt a stance on this matter .    2.764426222824889
personally , however , i shall continue to fight against the extreme right , to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of austria , and to organise a major public demonstration in UNK on saturday at 3 p . m .    2.846706667652078
fascism and neo - nazism are UNK !    2.502562869753949
the foul monster has been UNK !    2.9984948380429493
for me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might .    2.6234743668645484
europe was born out of a desire for peace , freedom and tolerance .    2.709618455456572
there is no question of it allowing xenophobic , racist and anti - UNK ministers to be tolerated at within it .    2.2128558921499466
do not count on me to keep quiet , without doing or saying anything .    2.1794700212523925
in yesterday ' s debate in the european parliament some members of this parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a member state .    3.3275931308795204
such a concern is UNK .    2.8391699723075576
the european parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in member states with which they disagree .    3.21750983094097
we have condemned basque and irish terrorism .    2.277625699407163
we have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities .    2.621526936190867
it is our responsibility as a parliament , particularly as the democratically elected voice of the european union , to comment on current political developments in austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament .    3.3758050718145594
by commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in austria from forming a coalition government .    2.490365366561029
we are nonetheless , as is our right as well as our responsibility , telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand .    2.548730505138063
others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement .    2.8231075649504414
such a view is not only a political UNK - out , it is positively dangerous .    3.3145514513367287
in reaching an agreement with jörg haider and his party , the austrian christian democrats would at a UNK be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching UNK for even greater electoral success .    2.0785455349201323
that is why the european union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in austria .    2.949429355654864
- ( sv ) we have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism .    3.1715566912429813
we have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the UNK politics that jörg haider stands for .    2.5257953634717976
we are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 member states have employed on this issue .    2.5969347924415964
the resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the member states ' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with article 6 of the treaty .    2.8946394288001067
what is also missing is a paragraph concerning the eu ' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in europe and austria which have been among the prior conditions for mr haider ' s electoral success .    2.9001324874985848
today , as previously in the history of europe , right - wing extremism is the result of UNK social and economic conditions of life .    3.190245873034154
the policy of cut - backs which has followed in the wake of UNK to emu has promoted the successes of right - wing extremism .    2.197672646948878
a radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in europe .    2.9710132360418156
- ( de ) i am making this statement on behalf of the csu .    2.7310264207470896
it is intolerable that the eu should involve itself in the formation of the government in a member state .    2.6369958361466237
it has no right to do so .    2.7648977856349433
instead of prematurely condemning the fpö and the austrian government which is being formed , there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition .    2.522936783936158
only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of europe .    2.9091486686643813
this does not mean that we sympathise with haider .    2.48836905725525
the csu european delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the fpö .    2.572602411795269
however , as politicians we must ask the question why 27 % of the austrian population voted for a party such as the fpö at the elections in october 1999 .    2.648805384466267
we must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results .    2.9607138791604117
only by tackling the arguments and policies of the fpö can we prevent a UNK of austrian politics .    2.605445122599209
however , the resolution of the european parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem .    3.143101592931664
for these reasons the csu european delegates are against this resolution .    2.295192116308676
" he knew what those UNK UNK did not know but could have learned from books : that the plague UNK never dies or disappears for good ; that it can lie UNK for years and years in furniture and UNK - UNK ; that it UNK its time in UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK ; and that perhaps the day would come when , for the UNK and the enlightening of men , it would UNK up its UNK again and send them forth to die in a happy city . "    2.7228632872838183
it is with these phrases that UNK UNK , at the close of the long allegorical novel UNK the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of UNK against the plague , reminds us , at the close of the second world war , that the fight against nazism , " the brown plague " as it was termed at the time , could not enjoy a definitive victory .    2.799978206882415
that because racial hatred , xenophobic violence , fear and rejection of what is different , have deep roots in all that is UNK in humanity , they may re - emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings .    2.1594304756299323
in this light , the events we are seeing in austria must be seen as tragic .    2.2576371073104826
for the first time since the second world war , a party which is openly pro - nazi , racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a european country .    2.366170537986629
confronted with this threat , which carries with it the UNK of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of europe , nothing must UNK us : not the legal UNK about what the treaty does or does not permit , not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene , not the derisory respect for formal democracy , and , above all , not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control .    2.7629359630577373
as the representative for a french overseas department , the island of réunion , a land of racial and ethnic UNK , where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of europeans , UNK from africa or UNK , UNK men from india or pakistan , or even chinese , every day i experience the profound truth of the remark by saint - UNK , " in being different to me , you are not doing me harm , brother , but enriching me ! "    2.2335397193820516
this human diversity is our main sources of wealth , and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it , wherever it may exist .    2.6854016241880094
for all these reasons i voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this house on the formation of the government in austria .    2.7152513282993636
jörg haider ' s rise to power , with the inauguration of a conservative right - wing and fpö coalition government , is a sign of the terrible revival in europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth .    2.4577616862424736
the success of the austrian freedom party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter , whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right - wing populism .    2.6163983819719365
the resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of fascism .    2.156855117978046
it can be explained by the feeling of UNK of the people who are the victims of the ideology of UNK UNK and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further .    3.1058324568136744
in order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an UNK dictator who is UNK for the third reich , we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the austrians opposed to fascism .    2.867837539467992
this is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a ' european democratic model ' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks UNK , UNK and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers , when it is not opening files on UNK .    2.5017479179987214
- ( de ) i have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in austria in view of a possible government being formed between the övp and the fpö .    2.826609096507704
i consider the casting of jörg haider as " europe ' s UNK " ( or even worse , neo - nazi and super racist ) to be counterproductive .    2.254333172326159
of course i , in no way , agree with the publicised statements of this right - wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any UNK of the hitler regime .    2.5716162832364113
however , i fear that a purely emotional reaction by europe to the events in austria will only multiply haider ' s UNK .    2.5477862637201736
the eu must not do him an invaluable UNK service .    2.2836086021721136
the strength of the fpö can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility .    2.986893378052731
it was only after they UNK UNK the fpö to tolerate a minority government and , obviously in vain , offered the freedom party ministerial posts , that the spö begin its massive campaign against haider .    2.3425067477585393
it turned its threatened loss of power into an " heroic battle for the preservation of values " and an imminent , pure - and - simple " decision between democracy and non - democracy " .    1.9501891791922137
this is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which i cannot UNK .    2.190918041894975
we german christian democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly UNK ourselves from them .    1.919964486615907
we revealed the UNK of the republicans who were nationalistic , xenophobic and anti - minority .    2.673445139309184
today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments .    2.5182395674445335
the german approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again .    2.1852666078308816
it cannot be copied arbitrarily since each member state has its own specific conditions .    2.6570338680910845
the övp ( austrian people ' s party ) , whose presence at european level we have also come to take for granted , is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of UNK in austria .    2.696262593190694
it can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles .    2.128582072822097
the council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government .    2.6322427642782573
this condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the austrian republic .    2.190512313438897
sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye .    2.2057043476345695
we must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left .    2.2365624596811933
i would have liked to see the same outrage in europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the UNK to the UNK and UNK regime in the UNK .    3.314918307885341
in the meantime , they have been forming governments in german federal states .    2.649994203285896
i fully support the statements made by commissioner prodi in today ' s session .    2.895138744985345
he spoke of the task of not isolating member states but of doing everything to unite them in common european values .    2.5359061919652284
- ( fr ) i voted against the joint resolution on the situation in austria .    3.1879290490221655
austria is a free , independent and sovereign country .    2.5491025865966064
consequently , neither the council , the commission nor the european parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a member state .    3.63356910154495
any interference by the european institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable ; it is in violation of the european treaty ( article 7 of the treaty of amsterdam ) .    3.8398134180200807
nevertheless , these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept turkey as a candidate for membership of the european union , despite its well - known human rights violations .    2.2400299732024322
nothing of this nature has yet occurred in austria .    2.3638272305779418
this precedent , created on the initiative of the portuguese presidency , is a worrying one as far as the future of the european union is concerned .    3.5795777364657875
on the one hand , the political UNK of austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of UNK thought . on the other hand , if tomorrow the governments of european union member states must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies , then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed .    2.618809332986236
in such circumstances will it even be worth having elections ?    2.387145516702595
this is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future .    3.29935290005851
- ( fr ) the vote which has just taken place in this chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our member states with such anxiety .    3.004971963791453
i believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is UNK .    2.561850173376976
i urge the council and the council presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the union .    3.970860706958089
i urge the commission to be less cautious .    3.2275700498926008
in this resolution , parliament is assuming its responsibilities .    2.974130914795158
having said that , in my opinion , the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum , the very least we could do .    2.9385228191641914
personally i argued in favour of a rather harder line , and i supported amendments nos 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 , as well as the oral amendment tabled by the socialist group .    3.02281287919889
in fact i consider it essential for the council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an austrian government which includes members of the austrian freedom party .    3.2651210867385516
including jörg haider ' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in europe , and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other union member states or in candidate countries .    2.5364825526594834
the austrian people ' s party must accept some historical responsibility for this .    2.565800361689505
it is our fundamental values which are at stake here . as the democratically elected representatives of the european people , we have no choice .    3.7156477234159015
we must reject what is unacceptable , as our constituents demand .    2.4064051808096507
because , when the spectre of barbarism UNK , failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation .    2.479602491490603
i abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution .    2.609589551662121
i condemn jörg haider ' s racist and xenophobic policy .    2.751468734951237
however , i cannot accept that an eu body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one member state .    2.481316426489849
i cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution , and i cannot vote in favour of the resolution , even though it would be a vote against the extreme right .    3.4584914721445252
the political leaders of europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another member state , just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority .    2.407756802509098
i therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution , which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights .    2.6266110198329575
the eu presidency ' s " common reaction " against the formation of the government in austria is legally unjustified .    2.4514306268975066
the treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 member states .    2.3897021011730653
nor should we isolate the forces in austria which wish to work for human rights .    2.4073018745251478
despite these objections of mine to the council ' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics , it was important to show clearly where the european parliament stands on questions of racism , which is why i voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote .    3.1604836451373424
that concludes the vote .    2.5974129394153045
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .    3.084842840990606
( the sitting was closed at 12 . 25 p . m . )    2.006377801457317
resumption of the session    2.550836440705554
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.838124730739872
the minutes of the sitting on thursday 3 february have been distributed .    2.237938846171528
i therefore propose to submit the minutes for your approval tomorrow morning , since obviously you do not have them and i must apologise for this .    2.553779213063798
i shall therefore postpone the approval of the minutes .    2.7218989152867605
madam president , on a point of order .    2.229708564340412
the bbc this morning reported that a british member of this house , holding a senior position within his delegation , continues to offer strategic advice to private clients , but does not state in the register of interests who these clients are .    2.073043345991866
the people of europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit , but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible .    2.9496154725867143
madam president , since these matters are currently being considered by the quaestors , may i ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the register of interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and , above all , to ensure that the register is not only available for inspection by this house , but is also published on the internet ?    3.0000694262623053
thank you , mr davies .    2.568366859152205
i shall look into this matter with the college of quaestors .    2.699921268538297
madam president , on a point of order .    2.229708564340412
as this is the first valentine ' s day of the new millennium i hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this house to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease , the biggest killer in the european union .    2.982045332666797
madam president , i rise under rule 9 of the rules of procedure of this house and UNK to the same point raised by mr davies about the very serious allegations made on bbc radio this morning .    2.708161751692432
i would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two members who were named in this particular bbc interview are not running their companies from this parliament or from parliamentary offices , because that would be a very serious matter indeed .    2.556589246454128
in the past the british conservatives ' double standards have brought the united kingdom ' s house of commons into UNK , and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this parliament .    2.7774423551434717
thank you , mr UNK .    2.708885979928353
as i informed mr davies , i promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors .    2.2186634052617573
madam president , on a point of order .    2.229708564340412
i have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the house .    2.704557732653928
i wonder on what point of order mr davies was speaking .    2.472951546413279
why did he not mention the fact that one of his own liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the bbc ?    2.624420506053315
is this house going to let its agenda be determined by UNK reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies , or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing europe ?    2.06703501878409
gentlemen , obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be UNK their assessment just on information from radio programmes .    2.6579742947437173
they will look into the matter thoroughly .    2.8812589254143233
madam president , i believe i am expressing the feeling of a great number of members of parliament in most of the political groups when i say that the message which the president of the commission sent to the new austrian chancellor a week ago created some unease .    3.3525777105732675
was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success , or to say , " i am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms " , or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation ?    2.3419403495832793
this is why , madam president , i should like to see mr prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words , so that nobody , absolutely nobody , can use this message , which is unusual and unwise , to say the least , to contribute , and that includes counter to the intentions of mr prodi , towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in austria a commonplace .    2.659812988786673
thank you , mr wurtz .    2.5659830318094796
i would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , not to start a debate at this point . this was just a procedural motion .    2.7347073018050354
let me remind you , mr wurtz , that we shall be seeing mr prodi tomorrow . he is going to make a statement on the commission ' s programme .    3.7823084546524197
naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement , just as mr prodi will be perfectly free to answer you .    2.493884994447126
i suggest that you clarify this matter at that time , if you so wish and if mr prodi agrees .    2.4670838475257573
madam president , it is with great regret that i have to trouble you yet again with an issue that i have raised here twice before .    2.9847671463977603
i have already told you on a number of occasions that we , on behalf of the dutch UNK , would like a dutch television channel .    2.8625857534146437
there are now 28 channels here in this parliament , including two greek , one portuguese , one finnish and one belgian , but still no dutch , and as many as seven english , six german and six french .    2.2658162766654653
i was promised back in september that there would be a dutch channel by january .    2.660717969597293
it is now february and we are still waiting .    3.3377420786323664
i would ask you once again to work on this .    3.0158141001869465
i wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite .    2.1294533213823117
mrs plooij - van gorsel , let me say how disappointed i am , because i personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago .    2.414595089693985
i have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and i believe that mrs banotti has an answer for you .    2.7134710517239675
i shall therefore , with your permission , give the floor to mrs banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion .    2.3502072993304566
madam president , as my dear friend UNK will know , i will do anything to make her and my dutch colleagues happy .    2.6447130570315234
i would like to assure you as UNK in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio , and i have already started UNK colleagues in this connection .    2.98689871561482
if it is of any comfort to her , the irish have not got their channel yet either .    2.4318360319855765
there seem to be UNK technical problems but we are definitely working on it .    2.9568202231910274
thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this .    2.6832290696147365
i am not so sure that our dutch members will be reassured on the grounds that the irish members too are unable to receive a national channel .    2.431209067488283
i think we must do what we can to see that all members can receive their own national channel .    2.6817646158142123
thank you , mrs banotti , and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this .    2.620663493810316
madam president , i should like to tell mr wurtz that the commission ' s doctrine is not the UNK doctrine of limited sovereignty and that , until proved otherwise , we are not in the situation where articles 6 and 7 would be applicable .    3.1422542774776385
austria , therefore , is perfectly entitled to form its government and the president of the commission is perfectly entitled , and even duty bound , to offer austria his best wishes .    2.928508449249227
mr wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party , the french communist mayors , were sending UNK against immigrant UNK in france .    2.2977606211344197
agenda    3.614422713529094
the next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents , pursuant to rule 110 of the rules of procedure .    2.1241166250816423
a ) sittings from 14 to 18 february 2000 in strasbourg relating to wednesday :    2.133460443913416
president .    3.1583781946373066
in view of the fact that no council representative is able to attend on wednesday evening , a number of groups - the group of the european people ' s party , the group of the party of european socialists , the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , the group of the greens / european free alliance , the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left - requested that the council statement on the cyprus question and mr brok ' s report on the pre - accession strategy for cyprus and malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus mr swoboda ' s report were brought forward in the agenda .    2.47968142894844
this would then give us , for wednesday ' s sitting , the two council statements on the coherence of union policies with development policy and on the un ' human rights ' sitting , followed by the joint debate on cyprus and then the reports by mr swoboda , mr corrie , mrs frassoni and mr knörr borràs .    2.6138806099671315
is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal ?    2.5631859543704705
since no one wishes to speak , i shall put this proposal to the vote .    3.4300614621068126
( parliament gave its assent ) relating to thursday :    2.124797701657719
president . i have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance .    2.5842878875463104
on the subject of human rights , i have received two proposals for additions : one from the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party for an item entitled ' cambodia ' and the other from the group of the greens , for an item entitled ' pinochet ' .    2.73360264639389
as you know , we can only include five items in the ' human rights ' section .    2.497629821412112
according to the list given in the final version of the agenda , there are already four items .    3.705937567184192
we can therefore table only one additional item .    2.357546714868096
who wishes to speak on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party to propose the addition of an item on cambodia ?    2.29560940102934
madam president , it is remarkable that the european parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of mr pinochet , despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued .    3.104629354844516
since the belgian government ' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken , it is important for parliament to at last give out a strong message , a message which should UNK that nobody can escape a just trial .    2.5424525846285593
it is inconceivable that the european parliament , which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights , should fail to adopt a clear stance on this .    2.6311205507269
madam president , this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time .    2.8601818167295363
firstly , the european parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of general pinochet , but , furthermore , there are certain questions to be borne in mind .    3.7070841050254604
the first is that this matter is sub UNK in several european countries , and i would like to remind members that there is still no european judicial area nor a european legal system .    2.9569673519207815
we are in favour of the international criminal court , but it does not yet exist .    3.5954692144299814
i believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up , but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure .    3.912682182930844
we believe that justice should be done in this case , but this is not the most appropriate procedure .    3.827131762035155
( parliament rejected the proposal ) president .    2.2237085819905733
we now come to the third proposal which is for ' environmental disasters in the waters of the danube ' , a proposal tabled by the group of the greens / european free alliance .    2.47351298853554
is there a member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?    2.381714732089602
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , what has occurred in a tributary of the danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the chernobyl disaster .    2.247659679839112
it affects not only romania , but also yugoslavia and , in fact , the entire danube basin .    3.390385612055937
we consider the matter to be important enough for the commission to react swiftly to this situation , and i think that parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject .    3.4609551140114556
( parliament gave its assent ) president .    2.0838343445528555
still relating to thursday ' s sitting , the ppe group has requested that mrs cederschiöld ' s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to wednesday as the last item on the agenda .    2.3377070890874387
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of the ppe in favour of this proposal ?    2.4665935142476476
madam president , the agenda has been UNK so many times that i would simply ask the chamber to support the present proposal .    3.4876153650401607
it is not a very time - consuming matter , but it is extremely important that it should get through parliament now and that there should be no delays .    3.182076475849643
it is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting , which is an extremely urgent matter .    3.154629412032435
we have tried to drive this proposal through .    2.387744117677625
i should therefore be very grateful indeed if the chamber could support it .    2.516583716196101
( parliament gave its assent )    2.0684259806454803
relating to friday : president .    2.553687366331575
relating to friday , on friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the group of the party of european socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in brussels , as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda .    2.6513717891368516
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of the pse group in favour of this proposal ?    2.4278825821722396
madam president , with apologies to my friend , UNK barón crespo , i should like to speak against this proposal .    2.78069421910796
i am surprised it has even been made , because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the conference of presidents .    2.626414446181733
i think that your proposal , madam president , to keep the debate and the vote separate , with the debate on friday and the vote at a later date , is a reasonable one .    3.2344174008201114
the reason is as follows : this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the european union .    2.4455766229787024
we already have a directive .    2.863409232769199
it is not an old one , it was issued in 1997 .    2.8956463715917464
deciding upon future policy lines , with a view to a new directive , rather hastily , without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners , i feel , runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators .    2.558991195657431
i propose , therefore , that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda , with the debate on friday and the vote at a later date .    3.1769368779745935
madam president , i clearly owe mr wurtz an explanation , and i am going give this explanation before the whole house .    2.4890289362910365
we had reached this agreement on principle in the conference of presidents .    2.5696373438618902
at the time , i did not know that commissioner bolkestein was going to appear next week before the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism to discuss this matter .    2.601128138943837
my group has debated this matter and considers that , given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area , it is appropriate that parliament makes an initial statement , regardless of any action it may take in the future , so that commissioner bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week ' s debate .    3.110569012822555
madam president , i should simply like to ask mr wurtz to take a second look at what this is about .    3.100078463307336
our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to , and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible .    2.79430271068067
( parliament gave its assent )    2.0684259806454803
madam president , as you know the cederschiöld report has been taken off thursday ' s agenda . that ought to mean that we have more time on thursday .    2.944909319089049
since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate , in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half , i simply wanted to ask whether the UNK services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time .    2.6851655533399694
in general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very UNK .    3.1380408533372375
last thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one - and - a - half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote .    2.2287305603696455
on friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda .    2.344011190257494
that is absolutely absurd .    2.772792094507715
i really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed .    3.5214486980651527
this sounds perfectly feasible . we shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour , considering the withdrawal of mrs cederschiöld ' s report .    2.402717131372488
this is all i am talking about here , just that .    2.6479820356670567
madam president , i would like to talk about an item on the agenda for wednesday , which you have not yet announced .    3.2780929723865735
i understand that there is no argument about the fact that the council declaration , on the next sitting of the united nations commission on human rights , is not going to include the declaration on the UNK anniversary of the geneva conventions , and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part - session in march , so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way .    3.367940433170958
i understand that there is agreement on this issue .    3.2820332266765346
madam president , this afternoon , in this chamber , reference was made to a series of reports on the bbc today programme this morning , which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow UNK their position as members of this house .    2.5116959538305155
these are serious allegations .    2.8025998792981066
they are completely UNK , UNK , politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their UNK .    2.702520487820769
we are taking legal advice .    2.713417888543788
my colleagues ' register of interests is complete .    2.7768818304775835
if we find that any member of this house or their employees UNK with the bbc in this UNK we will UNK them to the UNK of this house .    3.407288157495531
quite , we agree absolutely .    2.720203486995005
b ) sittings of 1 and 2 march 2000 in brussels    2.7919165567935442
sustainable urban development - rural development - equal initiative    2.887834847571599
. ( fr ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioners and members of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i was given the task of drawing up the european parliament ' s report on the community initiative programme interreg iii .    3.0192024336928207
upon referral to committee , we examined over a hundred amendments and , so far , 17 amendments , some of which have already been presented in committee , have once again been tabled .    2.8391995001529984
before discussing the content of the resolution , i should like to inform you of the elements which i took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur .    2.8984560486151314
first of all , i would like to remind you of the function of the interreg community initiative , founded on the principle of UNK and innovation .    3.0437587092748477
this programme constitutes a driving force for development on the european scale .    2.7277273710059315
interreg is one of the four community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000 - 2006 , and is the one with the largest budget for implementation , i . e . eur 4 . UNK billion as opposed to eur 3 . UNK billion at the present time .    2.688803364755406
the interreg initiative , created in 1990 , is built upon the wish to make the regions of europe ready for a ' europe without frontiers ' in the context of establishing the great single market .    2.590729930754155
at the time of the reform of the structural funds in 1994 and 1996 , the interreg cip has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans - european transport and energy distribution networks .    2.9630104603726455
these programmes promoted cross - border , transnational and interregional cooperation within the european union by encouraging balanced development of the community area .    2.949029103028422
the interreg iii programme , for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the european commission , pursuant to the terms of european community regulation no 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the structural funds , continues these measures .    2.8969189938855457
it is based on three strands . strand a organises cross - border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions , at both internal and external borders of the european union , on the basis of joint cross - border development strategies which member states ' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing . strand b governs transnational cooperation between national , regional and local authorities in various member states or applicant countries regarding regional development , transport networks and the environment .    2.7693461821407284
member states , i . e . national authorities , are responsible for implementing this strand . finally , strand c organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the member states or third countries to exchange experience under strands a and b and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development , subject to consultation with the european commission which is responsible for its implementation .    2.9062006887827936
the commission proposes redistributing the interreg funding as follows : between 50 and 80 % for strand a , 6 % for strand c , and the remainder for strand b , i . e . from 14 up to a maximum of 44 % .    2.521904626084319
the european commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand a and strand b . it bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period .    2.1578838529276405
the most remote regions may benefit from support under strand b . the commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand a is not comprehensive , but is comprehensive for strand b . the commission reserves the option to , at a later date , put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions , for strand c .    2.2830296051379775
the adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on structural funds .    2.9287228736497974
proposals are drawn up by member states and are submitted for approval to the european commission , which checks their UNK with the general guidelines , adopted .    3.6450491403962486
these proposals must include a number of elements , an overview of the cross - border or transnational priorities and strategies , a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan .    2.486253034044291
i belong to the great majority of members of parliament who voted in favour of continuing the interreg community initiative programme . i regret that parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme , which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency , but i acknowledge that this was not an easy operation .    3.0067319362488543
i also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in , as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 november last year and then on 26 january . i further regret the fact that neither the regions , nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme .    2.614642326525779
in promoting cross - border , transnational and interregional cooperation , this cross - disciplinary instrument is the very UNK of a regional policy on the european scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the community territory .    2.871033881286674
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the conference on rural development held in cork from 7 to 9 november 1996 set rural development as one of the european union ' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture , to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services , and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life , diversification and job creation .    2.5811783233300694
an integrated development policy for all rural areas in the european union is therefore needed , consisting of the following elements : an integrated , multi - sectoral approach , simplification of administrative procedures , improvement of the partnership between european institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment .    2.556817789101402
in its 1998 policy paper , agenda 2000 , the commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based : the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas .    2.855194856787093
the first principle means creating a new ' pact ' between farmers and society , making the farmer ' UNK of the countryside ' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside ' s UNK value .    2.628790136192304
the second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector , so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented . in this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the cap .    3.031936706096267
the leader community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom - up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs .    2.1502308529347935
the following objectives were set : improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative ; promoting the UNK of knowledge in the rural development sector ; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas .    2.1204460673123666
leader i applied to the rural areas covered by structural fund objectives 1 and 5b , and UNK local action groups participated in it , with financing of eur 1 UNK million .    2.5212089577121746
leader ii ( 1994 - 1999 ) , for which a total evaluation has , unfortunately , not yet been completed , had a wider scope than leader i : there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated , after reallocation of resources , probably amounted to over eur 4 000 million .    2.1341588026192446
in october 1999 , following the success of leader i and leader ii , the commission decided to extend the initiative .    3.3758073170175793
for the 2000 - 2006 period provision has been made , unfortunately , only for a total contribution of eur 2 020 million , and an indicative allocation for each member state has been set .    2.799162250390549
leader + differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible . it is also more ambitious , and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet .    2.9867868739395957
the main changes are as follows : all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from leader + ; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous ; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes , such as the use of information technology , improving the quality of life , and adding value to local products .    2.575442569590633
i therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because , as i was saying , it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious , even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population UNK .    2.8109971297888214
i believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the union and i repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence , such as the UNK .    3.196118209059192
i regret the delay with which leader , as was the case with the other three initiatives , was presented to parliament and for the knock - on delay this entailed for the whole procedure .    2.7360766204929976
finally , i am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated , if you consider , in addition , that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous leader ii .    3.7406460038031493
i would like to thank the commission services for their UNK and cooperation , and i would like to thank my colleagues in the committee on agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments .    3.018156879613943
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , my report on equal takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new community initiative , whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market .    2.547866198080512
the report was a major undertaking because it also UNK opinions from four further committees - from the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , the committee on women ' s rights and equal opportunities , and the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs .    2.308908336964524
this community initiative succeeds the two UNK programmes adapt and employment and has a much smaller budget of around eur 2 . 8 billion .    2.4479032719719416
the initiative adopts a completely new approach , which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships .    2.4873489245395244
the intention is clear : targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level , projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunities .    2.822111533093699
this objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this house .    3.0647555294911233
in addition , equal should feed into the national action plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these action plans .    2.5485869021729277
it is an important community initiative which , together with the three other initiatives , urban , leader and interreg , is financed out of the structural funds .    2.8382022680495305
in my report i have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships .    2.375618961622691
i consider technical support to be necessary but , given the problems with the former taos , no new taos should be set up without parliament ' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level .    2.787719471126722
nevertheless , technical assistance is necessary .    2.7912190697876564
particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice , with special emphasis on mainstreaming .    2.3249429964138058
this has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises .    2.555202407165482
a compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers .    3.0323953256582654
however , in this context , madam president , to allow us to work out the details , i should like to request that the vote on the equal report be held not tomorrow but on wednesday .    3.1081977102163125
i believe that it is important for the community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the european parliament , because parliament put the appropriations for equal in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that members ' ideas were also reflected in this community initiative .    3.1090264439806785
in this connection , the european parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in parliament .    2.759376899301078
equal should live up to its name , and this is my firm intention .    2.993225372388023
it should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the european union .    2.6149245172197046
it should prevent society from UNK .    2.4410294932183323
it should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life .    2.4049435494017417
that is my intention and i would ask the house to give this report overwhelming support !    3.2193525214344545
madam president , it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new urban community initiative and it is an achievement that i am here tonight because air france cancelled my flight at 2 . 10 p . m . but i am here !    3.340278163569555
just a year ago when the commission produced its proposals around agenda 2000 it UNK the urban initiative .    2.6565391013216013
yet we as politicians knew that there was a UNK of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000 .    2.89723474214718
parliament , therefore , can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put urban back on the agenda and get the commission and council to make a u - turn .    3.0900231867757952
urban policy has always been at the forefront of eu policy .    2.742213077882071
in my member state , for example , we are developing a strategic approach in a white paper and an urban government UNK is looking at the problems of urban communities .    3.1680981826221934
with eight out of ten people in europe living in urban areas , it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation , social exclusion , UNK , crime , drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that .    2.8045436301895244
for example , in my own region , in manchester , the urban community initiative has been a tremendous success .    3.216657531643676
urban funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the uk , in UNK side .    2.941922527493659
the millennium youth park project is helping to get young people re - engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community .    2.3676255035716
the work of this urban agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous british pubs .    2.109109373212649
this is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the eu in terms of communication and publicity .    3.4107348285048604
as regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative , they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity .    2.657938658231063
we agree that they ought to be indicative in nature , allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes .    2.611739132756552
in committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50 .    3.672674387593629
we are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor .    3.0596272219925185
instead , we should go for good - quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal , to attract UNK investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect .    2.369226621811271
the member states should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations .    3.381296365854221
in the designation of local urban programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas .    2.3300412588786936
in the uk the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and UNK to help determine not only eu but national and regional assistance programmes .    2.511864023821014
this needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the eu criteria .    3.1970972596359015
i would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that .    2.4955317269638684
our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems : high unemployment and often very low - paid precarious employment , poverty and social exclusion .    2.0464256137002916
often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency .    2.22765614074126
we therefore have unstable communities which are UNK with crime , drug - dealing and UNK .    2.3209127520255004
this is all too familiar in many of our urban areas .    2.8926945291011594
all these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents , yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity .    2.7172991868583436
that is why again , in my report , i have asked that action under the urban programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem : these areas do not have single , " UNK " problems .    2.8616389646563043
instead , communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems , using eu resources as a value added to local actions .    2.049461613203582
i would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti - discrimination , as provided for in the amsterdam treaty .    2.346966924148427
the community initiative means community involvement .    2.8206703948867164
some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents .    2.6027664137924815
we need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes .    2.5242883363611623
the time - scale therefore proposed by the commission is very ambitious .    3.572865711779335
it is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation .    2.0189984443271047
the commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also UNK the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice .    2.574448052469435
this is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks .    3.2352425396338678
we need to deploy the energies of the unemployed , the UNK skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems .    2.348148369149871
we shall thereby be able to replace poverty , dependency and UNK with equity , initiative and participation .    2.5234873542096574
this will help us to restore the credibility of the eu and the confidence of citizens that europe can deliver local action to solve local problems .    2.822877982630773
. ( it ) mr president , as the rapporteur , mrs mccarthy , has already pointed out , we can certainly consider urban a success for the european parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations .    3.761833331491256
as we have heard , the objective of urban is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas , bearing in mind that 80 % of the population of europe lives in cities .    2.9777825265065605
creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long - term job creation , action to combat poverty , measures to assist low - income groups and old people , facilities for children , racial and ethnic integration , better opportunities for participation , a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures .    2.235184619185992
the communication from the commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic , social , and infrastructural measures .    3.209406802152197
however , we must remember that , in addition to urban , a number of other community instruments are also available in the social sector : innovative actions under article 6 of the esf regulation , pilot projects , particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the european parliament under the 2000 budget and the equal and interreg initiatives and mainstream esf activities .    2.6618789122125874
as the committee on employment and social affairs stressed in its opinion , the commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding .    3.131445958022577
while , on the one hand , we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary , we would on the other hand urge the commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved .    3.1974122006937735
not only is this coordination essential but , as we stated in our opinion , exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential .    2.826102338589148
mr president , the importance of this initiative is increasing constantly as economic and social problems in europe ' s cities intensify and the public feels more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood .    2.7166983967562057
that situation will be compounded by social UNK resulting from european union enlargement , and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities .    2.941132147312421
addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities ' historical and cultural role .    2.6958585035482274
however , in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis .    2.9975865559635415
here , we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women , and the agencies that represent them , in planning and implementing the urban initiative programmes .    3.372225423253021
as the committee on equal opportunities , we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women , mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments , and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations , social solidarity .    2.493863858475898
effective implementation of this initiative could have a UNK result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels , thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of european policy in their day - to - day life in real terms .    2.4203060075137093
mr president , our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the commission for the urban programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention .    2.5161602135196017
in committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand - in - hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by urban .    2.744418153933473
we considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration .    2.4034566103720514
our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole UNK of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning , action to prevent juvenile delinquency , the reintegration of offenders , and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved , for example the police , the courts and social services .    2.2699469019680345
we adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue urban - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because , as we see it , programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the european union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the european union enjoy peaceful coexistence .    3.6628343215297314
for this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind .    2.6390827895798226
i should like to comment on the concerns which the committee on employment and social affairs has with regard to the largest of the four community initiatives , interreg iii .    2.8490936408188356
it must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under interreg iii .    2.4649378197763974
in the light of the fact that 50 % of unemployment in the union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - i need only refer to the possibility of UNK migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative .    3.4341848420267915
the measures eligible for funding listed in annex ii of strand a do also seem encouraging in this respect .    2.133670324832253
in reality , however , the commission communication does not contain a single provision for the member states with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects .    3.5505070098681664
i should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures , especially in areas with high levels of long - term and youth unemployment .    2.6519861938830025
employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand b , especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre - accession strategy .    3.1675448612644472
in general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing .    2.298752736627129
the fact that administrative expenditure on interreg iii is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise , although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the commission ' s support programmes .    2.92474143671358
however , i should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal . it is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the eu is once again given the importance which it deserves .    3.5222869367496537
mr president , the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism considered , amongst other things , the report on leader + and , as a result , agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions , believing that that process could be effective on two conditions : that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community , and that commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using leader + resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities .    2.422472355450007
we ask for a guarantee that the decision - making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements : political representatives and public administrations , companies and economic operators , and social operators , including unions and non - governmental organisations .    2.3430195222316987
we would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies .    3.0711698500428204
we would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development , whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself , and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes , included in objectives 1 and 2 , and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located .    2.961678620877892
we are pleased that all the rural areas of the union may be involved in leader + , but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate community resources in the less - favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio - economic cohesion within the union , and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion .    3.5084005051812204
the committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of UNK development , in particular based on local traditions , techniques and practices , on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy .    2.321362142251725
the committee supports the commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that , given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations , the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants .    2.2988121712876826
we believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3 , financed by leader , with those of other actions financed by other community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership , such as interreg , UNK , phare , tacis and meda , in the same areas .    2.713086331042329
mr president , mrs stenzel , ladies and gentlemen , before addressing the equal report itself , i should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based .    2.9945190185585777
the basic objectives of an eu - wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability , entrepreneurship and adaptability .    2.431417607332706
these objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and UNK as possible to the economy .    2.606846366160799
however , the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people ' s self - determination .    3.169828133504843
only then does it stop being a question of economic UNK and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives .    2.1400231121103306
mrs stenzel ' s report has , however , turned out very well , at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned .    3.2904788289260036
all asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes , although this should be self - evident .    3.294702257992166
nevertheless the conservatives voted against this in the committee .    3.253306789243931
i would ask them the following questions : does your policy seek to UNK people ?    2.211732160241248
what is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so ?    2.8861262612493803
does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability ?    2.202009306866199
it is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme , because there remains a shortcoming in the report .    2.726969664713379
particular emphasis is given to the point that women ' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more UNK should be built .    3.2761395874959476
anyone who UNK men UNK UNK the career UNK and worries only about UNK places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming !    2.3052322964444616
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism adopted this opinion on the equal report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one UNK .    2.1974249735133227
i am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible , the committee on employment and social affairs .    3.3555981071975642
this cross - group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions , which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy , transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market .    2.720470730053954
the members of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the commission proposal which they would criticise : firstly , for example , the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities ; secondly , the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the commission and thirdly , the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the commission and the technical assistance bodies .    3.065433628953002
that is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure .    2.978247507058852
the committee based its conclusions on these critical comments .    2.2776606482789834
we attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector , in tourism and in small and medium - sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium - sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change .    2.5975245994095024
dovetailing the activities under the community initiative with the european employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the equal programme .    2.828542772573137
we fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at european level as an integral part of the equal programme .    2.669562582378293
the specific target of deriving european added value brings the regional cooperation up to european level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators .    2.2595227701157814
this is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it .    3.3214720183964173
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank the rapporteurs , who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time .    2.230256107843106
however , criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee .    2.8639019605616585
the reports are late , and , in addition , they were very hastily discussed by the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .    2.8786769393326463
a good opportunity to discuss the results , good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost .    2.440925645812987
our group is keen to stress the importance of cross - border activity under the interreg programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the european union .    2.5496871442139337
such important areas include the balkans and the adriatic region , but , in my opinion , we should not ignore cooperation with russia either .    2.9726383834194654
our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the interreg , tacis , ispa and phare programmes .    2.785415816952394
this coordination is at present lacking , and the commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it .    3.080147097189645
we here in parliament are waiting for the commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible .    2.9292731406708232
it is of decisive importance to get local business , organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes .    2.2866496577882782
experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful .    2.3438856187825325
projects have often remained half - finished , and their efficiency has been UNK by administration and bureaucracy .    2.484498314880075
we also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement .    2.541772927922478
our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee .    2.747088938362608
i would like to mention here again the urban report , in which the rapporteur , in the explanatory statements , has dealt UNK with the issue of the minimum sum of eur 500 per inhabitant as per the commission ' s guidelines .    3.4383708541789315
it will not work as an automatic target , but must be applied in the target area according to UNK conditions .    2.567198952122241
this is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn .    2.4366485281800663
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , interreg is one of the most european of all the structural funds .    2.7108163038743736
here , projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support ; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries .    2.301963215700975
unfortunately this is only true for part of the money , that is only for the borders within the eu .    3.6946754880392967
but it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross - border cooperation .    2.6215362024915834
the regulation UNK that there is one , but there is not .    4.241342828362552
the fact is that the commission has not amended the regulation for years , although parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time .    3.1528183939488117
the practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be UNK .    2.4898490785930387
since 1996 , parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties .    3.299689867387271
nothing has happened !    3.0678687637364237
parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross - border cooperation , and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other commissioners .    2.956395671058206
we want a europe for the people and not a europe of paper - UNK !    3.435710347829648
according to my group , this is excellent if , as a result of this , deprivation within regions , towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved .    2.9813095370941807
that is a question of solidarity and progress .    3.236097316491793
but UNK out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending .    2.437021845014641
the local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience .    2.29651150654779
they find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes .    2.533995312099347
anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly , but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval .    1.9992846203358836
in some cases , i get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems , but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the european union ' s blessing .    2.6916898469129844
it seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co - financed by the european union .    2.3648274519375567
too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux , consultation and control , and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place .    2.6425134907651335
after the planned accession of new member states with their 100 million inhabitants , the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current eu member states , this UNK will generate even more protest .    2.872284816456066
in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , the confederal group of the european united left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion , mr nogueira román , on leader .    2.5262612788265497
he was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas .    3.252313047591952
if there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas , we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality .    2.415804015059217
after all , innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without european funding .    2.096056957128358
a second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils .    2.951804415712568
the emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities , non - profit - making organisations and profit - making companies join forces .    2.5222851413493674
the discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied .    2.3813110525226153
in this respect , one of the UNK considered is reminiscent of the dutch UNK model , the structurally planned cooperation between government , trade unions and employers ' organisations .    2.295096910621351
let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population .    2.4311365781832235
so , really , these bodies should already provide for a balance , and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process .    2.5917861781840448
my group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play , as their input in society is important in our view .    2.6772757361875987
this could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short - sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start .    2.100041337017777
but the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that , unfortunately , democracy is not fully functioning yet .    2.8427146658506666
one of the objections is that , due to the restricted role of the elected bodies , businesses gain more influence .    2.9275164278960664
as long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few , it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils .    2.606830420375425
mr president , there are economic frontiers within the european union , and the internal market with the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is fully operating at this time .    2.809782261158687
but for the internal market to work effectively and for the single european currency to be a success it is important that all regions within europe , of which there are over 100 , can economically compete within this very challenging environment .    2.993348334265223
some areas within the european union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita .    2.7658938869169654
there are poor regions within the union which need to be given european assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the european union structure .    3.182858793580827
that is why , when we look at the eu financial perspective between 1989 and 1993 , and 1994 and 1999 , we find such a large proportion of the eu budget was put aside for the administration of the european regional development fund and the european social fund .    3.205681440391967
there are twin problems that still remain for many regions in europe : firstly , the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road , water treatment facilities and related transport networks ; secondly , the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long - term unemployment , which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of europe .    2.7947679267483414
there must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a europe of the cities alone .    3.110636829555087
we need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small - and medium - sized enterprise sector in rural parts of europe as well .    2.677770924699896
the core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the eu initiative programmes , namely , the new interreg iii initiative , equal and the leader + scheme .    3.1736259464474665
between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the eu to promoting cross - border development , combating the problems of long - term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes .    3.0604384602909165
mr president , quite a few towns and cities within the european union have to UNK with deprivation .    3.146230018351272
the member states do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately .    2.6876069717820563
over the next seven years , the commission ' s proposals concerning urban will entail a reduction in both the community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit .    3.4321266906473578
in common with mrs mccarthy , i have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced .    3.405185233115424
it is desirable for member states to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget .    3.168229674274286
as far as the budget is concerned , as already stated , urban is there to support and complement national policy .    2.8080902780774664
in order to generate extra means if necessary , i think it is entirely logical to turn first to the member states and private investors .    3.0850929858274143
consequently , we cannot support amendment no 2 of the greens , as borne out in the committee meeting .    3.899216074531339
in addition , i am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood , especially where community contributions are concerned , should incentivise .    2.5367900798260044
structural support is said to cause subsidy - dependence .    2.4751779098568214
we would then be UNK ourselves .    2.7796130985091234
i would like to finish off by making a general comment on interreg .    2.2079223295389117
in my opinion , funding for cross - border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions .    2.8311233136367835
when projects are implemented , it is also important that they do not contravene general community legislation .    3.2867863827712447
according to the report issued by the court of auditors on the year 1998 , this is not an imagined risk .    3.2743248423477445
hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects .    2.691659342620366
before i begin i will take the liberty of expressing my UNK at the way in which austria has been UNK by 14 council representatives .    2.7810543491303923
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as part of the reform of the structural funds the community initiatives are being UNK to a total of four .    3.0548330125377157
i welcome the continuation of interreg and the priority which it has been accorded .    3.147221635420883
however , the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems .    3.0976870184359964
the regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines , although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the structural funds .    3.5889750891162806
there is no direct transition between interreg ii and iii , the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding .    2.344206638895288
that is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects .    2.184212763800614
when interreg is implemented , it will need to be coordinated and UNK with the other financial instruments concerned .    3.812383054324107
this is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed .    3.5164358990541826
however , problems will arise in particular from the fact that under phare , for example , funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project - related , whereas interreg funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures - related basis .    2.184325710067157
this will cause practical problems in the future , and i hope that despite this it will be possible to implement interreg effectively .    3.5252495034019975
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the community initiative leader proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas .    2.398602592143101
the preservation of this community initiative in particular , in the form of a new version - leader + - is therefore greatly to be welcomed .    3.36333519901224
the new leader + programme now covers all rural areas in the european union , which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects .    2.7743646818989824
it is important for there to be coordination between leader + and the other support initiatives in the european union , but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important .    2.732124282420865
overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any UNK effects .    2.9582646278839126
in this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under leader is very welcome .    2.313444385855045
in the same way , through the leader initiative , structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas .    2.589917108746421
attention must be paid in the leader + programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas ; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result .    2.87105323047726
leader must now move into the implementation phase .    2.552532739246352
the operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the commission , which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible .    2.8216792672645075
five months are provided for this .    2.6948357416877595
that seems to me to be rather too long .    2.8607712575484063
efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times .    2.7978396365405813
because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible .    2.2280689268390157
despite all the delight over the UNK of this community initiative leader + , i do still have one further concern .    3.3593730349853184
in its proposal the commission called for an observatory for the leader + programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented .    2.424294497646227
for me this raises the following questions : who will work there ?    2.367122994244207
how will these people be selected ?    2.4832898339646845
where , above all , will the required money come from , and where should this observatory be located ?    2.7702802176022816
i do think , though , that the leader + programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks , which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the commission in any case .    3.1648888498097727
in addition , experience from other fields where UNK have been set up shows that , apart from rather UNK creating jobs , they are not of any great benefit .    2.4429541128666745
i would therefore call on the commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that leader + programmes run smoothly .    2.815379372274675
assessment and publication are part of this , and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past .    3.1833922934394927
our internal borders , or what remains of them , no longer cause wars , but they do continue to generate economic UNK , social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of europe .    2.5758129592887316
the community ' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border UNK , which contradict the spirit of european unity .    3.0656468261985497
the economic and social cohesion which we propose is based , by means of the interreg initiative , on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent .    3.119674683328405
interreg has always been at the heart of a genuine community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our european territory .    2.5340478627201564
although the european parliament supports this initiative , our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of interreg ii .    3.454359764630736
however , we are aware that we must not delay this third version further , since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway . the success of interreg is clear and that is the opinion of the local , regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects .    2.838322834753375
the people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together , of innovation , of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and UNK each other .    2.4910914497817878
there are many interesting questions relating to it , the monitoring centre , the principle of concentration etc . however , i would like to concentrate on the management bodies .    2.9896866344585127
we must create joint , interregional and transnational management bodies , in which all local and regional authorities , as well as economic and social operators , play an active role .    2.83579783551038
there must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border .    2.6488261578328265
we must create a cross - border culture , and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation , UNK overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each member state , in each region and each municipality .    2.7522434044978343
a project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication .    2.7536428022155985
during debates in committee , we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating interreg with other annual or UNK financial instruments , such as meda , tacis or phare .    2.7781224047180566
this parliament ' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties , making proposals capable of solving them to the commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes .    2.978749169822672
mr president , my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the urban initiative , in ireland in particular , has been quite successful and i am keen that the european union make a further contribution in that area .    3.55765277731815
it is a sad fact that there are many hundreds , if not thousands , of communities in the european union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage .    2.8350285365644963
even in member states and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos , in situations where there are inadequate facilities , where schooling is very poor , where the physical infrastructure is under - developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife .    2.3466049726920244
it seems to me that in order for the european union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the european union it must give assistance to member states to demonstrate that the union works for these citizens and their families .    3.5598045147175483
the programme has been extremely successful in ireland , as indeed i know it has been successful in other countries .    2.920080350985736
it was quite slow in getting off the ground there , but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes .    2.7901802719587168
it is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative .    2.290090334931089
it would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the urban programme .    2.2943766380890396
i should like to make one further point before i conclude : we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious urban development policy .    2.427151615365277
this , unfortunately , is not the case in ireland .    4.084399087026867
i applaud the innovative approach of the equal programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market .    2.758001471417155
the development partnerships are a very clever idea , even though they are experimental .    2.63153235619311
i have two major concerns , however , about the development partnerships .    3.4876000482676757
they should be accessible to smaller groups , accessible for them to be able to devise , implement and monitor the programmes .    2.6794961612692405
we need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme .    2.581326709571027
i have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon , so that it becomes accessible to everyone .    2.8996096404943743
i am glad to see that this was accepted into the report , but i cannot agree with amendment no 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all .    2.610478807403018
my second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems , for example , disabled people ' s access to the workplace .    2.775920129870711
projects should also specifically address this problem .    2.6400361199501394
these concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes .    2.652898398897485
i certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the west midlands .    2.7192966467945734
i now turn to the controversial issue of asylum - seekers and refugees .    2.31814793970368
although i am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with UNK , having access to equal , i would support the possibility of access for all other asylum - seekers and refugees .    2.918023127014275
it is only fair and right for them to be able to access equal in the same way as everyone else .    2.935526388164389
thank you , mr president . ladies and gentlemen , with the leader report , rural development is very much to the fore .    3.2455839593872113
this does not happen all that often and it is gratifying , especially as the leader programmes have been key elements in the union ' s rural development policy .    2.800401540981293
it must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning , but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as , for example , areas experiencing depopulation .    2.5493721582850095
it must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the leader programme , local operators have combined forces , debated and prepared projects .    2.514636152540737
these programmes have , therefore , been important channels for UNK democracy , the rationale of the citizen for europe .    2.7094821177698605
so , the concept for leader + should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes .    2.5412222526263037
one urgent question is therefore raised : why , when this programme has been successfully run for ten years , is leader + still classed as experimental ?    2.368758250929651
are there so many other european schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful ?    2.0498962194091552
for how much longer is the commission going to leave leader at the experimental stage instead of bringing it UNK as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development ?    2.590648064004866
moreover , i wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the commission wishes to restrict leader + .    2.8313283065345614
at a time when , commissioner , after seattle , we europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects , why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient ?    2.591428988552104
as an UNK , let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many - sided approaches .    2.7390854006091954
in this connection , the commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries .    2.5057375052057793
a better solution would be , as indeed the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism suggests , strengthened coordination between leader + and the community cooperation and partnership programmes , such as interreg , phare , sapard or meda .    2.336295862889826
the fact is , showing solidarity with eastern europe , is all very well , but it is not enough .    2.709000245901932
the tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south , particularly the countries around the mediterranean , must not be abandoned .    3.3333342508746364
therefore , once more , we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision . codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type , which require cooperation and cross - disciplinary application .    2.523772769078838
mr president , i have a few very brief comments .    2.6599539051311982
we are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period . this is not very good at all .    2.8850458925125073
programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory , while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud .    2.3478273989871057
the community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain UNK .    2.5371387225513113
they must , however , not be UNK to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy , but must develop their own self - sufficient role .    3.579955949898093
for example , adapting equal to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations UNK this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts .    2.3198993008611932
extending the leader initiative to every area in the union entails the risk of UNK deprived areas even more , to the benefit of more developed areas .    2.8843694718706465
the interreg initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas , islands and both mountain and non - mountain areas , such as the UNK of UNK in greece , whose omission from annex i of the commission ' s communication is ill - considered .    2.6692356446285017
mr president , rural development has been identified by this parliament and the commission as a priority policy area , and i would like to welcome here today the commissioner responsible , commissioner fischler .    3.2219230717637237
our response to rural decline has come late in the day , but i suppose better late than never .    2.586259069753739
family farming is now recognised as central to the european agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed , certainly within the time - scale of agenda 2000 .    2.7138775204428045
in my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms .    2.7900040783209517
it UNK all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival .    2.890343763835466
as the commissioner knows , farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities .    2.8865695964795917
for this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development .    2.4712166399201916
in this regard leader has established itself as an effective development initiative .    2.2112822755032124
it provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems .    2.329000578464025
the voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated .    3.0938350477341827
yet , through leader , there can be no UNK its effectiveness as an integral part of broader eu and national policy .    2.245346128989978
in conclusion , while welcoming commission approval for leader + , i am concerned about the time delay between the ending of leader ii and the commencement of the new programme .    2.837515238325134
i urge you to look seriously at this problem .    2.4471572628980502
a break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers .    2.330979853803244
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , having read the commission communication on the interreg iii initiative , and pointing out that i took part in the vote on mr decourrière ' s report within the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and , particularly in the context of interreg iii b , with the commission ' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of UNK run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector , a sector in which many associations , especially UNK , are already making enormous investments in my own country .    2.6346938585713855
i should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand a of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand iii c and , finally , in requesting that members of the european parliament should be involved in the european observatory for cross - border , UNK and interregional cooperation .    2.8432400525858896
i should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which , in the commission communication with reference to interreg iii and iii b , involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of natura 2000 , which i think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems , from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted .    2.614460654648255
finally , if the commission and the relevant councils of ministers permit , i should like to stress that the members of the european parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the interreg projects and , beyond that , of similar initiatives .    3.561119782658739
it would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned , otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens .    2.720388327923609
mr president , first of all , i would like thank the rapporteur of the equal report , mrs stenzel , very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us .    2.9457512969520994
equal is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light , doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds .    2.2684427562341116
this is an arduous task .    2.7068243653004758
only , the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped .    3.2127380857241574
this is why it is so hard to strike a balance , not only between the different countries or the different components , but especially between the different groups listed in the programme , and in fact this is what has UNK us to date .    3.0991689521730272
comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another .    2.4237385371817433
i , for my part , have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme , and i have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the european parliament devoting special attention to them .    3.1767325643706483
although a few other groups have been mentioned , it is the member states , in particular , which are on the UNK .    4.409132668750085
for example , i know of one member state that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component , namely refugees .    3.0025210556375774
i would , therefore , ask the commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups .    3.102498070674
it should not be the case that one member state , under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle , can decide that all funding should go to one group .    2.8474978017480623
i think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which mr UNK has warned us so vehemently , to wit , that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend .    2.519326539518527
this is not the case !    2.8888694440136855
it has to be redistributed time and again .    2.7587250528783653
it should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the finance minister ' s treasury funds .    2.5775029716984674
that is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here .    4.269818809935001
i believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this parliament , and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance , can be solved .    3.3406079093397887
as far as the commission is concerned , i hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this parliament , mainly with a view to reaching a balance .    3.5935135369459004
i would just like to underline this - the situation is , of course , a little precarious - parliament has , for the sake of convenience and safety , placed the equal programme on the back burner for the time being , so that parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed .    2.8880512045670974
i believe that this is actually a good thing .    3.1536414900312177
the position of parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear .    2.9352486025469102
the rules of procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful .    2.574379653172091
mr president , there is no doubt that the interreg initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the european union .    2.8202458070417658
however , i should like to stress interreg ' s particular importance for the balkan area , where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country , greece , which is the only member state on that long - suffering peninsula .    2.3917910061486944
for greece , for the neighbouring countries italy and austria , but also for europe as a whole , the social and economic restoration of the balkans , bringing political stability , is a vitally important matter .    3.406871828415267
so far , some balkan countries have received aid from the phare and UNK programmes , while others have not .    2.3419415178796896
during the new programme period , in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations , such as ispa and sapard , it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of interreg with other financial aid to third countries .    2.738497596840202
the efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally , and i say that because in the meda programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome , so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme .    3.007422788392482
i should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter - state cooperation zones has taken no account of the mediterranean ' s geographical peculiarities , which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions .    2.7352499597613478
we therefore ask the commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review .    2.684375897079616
i end by stressing the need for the european union to persist with such initiatives , which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions , and to foster their harmonious development .    2.9237296261184067
and since this is st . valentine ' s day , as a former mayor of a regional city , i propose that we should all declare our love for all the european regions which need that love .    2.9743657463029525
mr president , commissioner fischler , rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles : preservation of jobs , UNK of the countryside and , not least , local culture , because that is of the utmost importance .    2.6655447428509316
only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured .    2.7537887651434225
we can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the alps and they are devastating .    2.7236691948020195
but i warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside .    2.199903756024886
and neither should we create structures which are UNK on subsidies and which will be dependent on them UNK .    2.8308947075498567
to really guarantee sustainability - a UNK which has , since it gained new currency , become relatively UNK of meaning , but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed , amongst other things , is an integrated approach in the countryside towards , for example , tourism and agriculture .    2.808922079394666
the investment needs to be UNK .    3.553343907508432
young , creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside . if they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more .    2.2448056863879153
none of us think much of the principle of UNK , all - round distribution , and the pilot projects need to act , as it were , like avalanches and trigger other similar projects .    2.889444219610383
i would be in favour of supporting self - contained cycles of projects and , even though leader i and leader ii may have had shortcomings here and there , overall they were certainly positive .    2.4088790825730064
i should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the nordic countries but also for UNK areas - the alps , the pyrenees and the sierra UNK , from where i have just returned - in respect of population size and density .    2.340675422219496
mr president , i want to talk about the equal report , especially the issue of the policy on refugees .    3.6007164075900717
last week , we had a very UNK discussion about the formation of the austrian government .    3.390259674726785
today , we are already discussing the austrian coalition government ' s policy on refugees because mrs stenzel , who is the author of the equal report , of course represents austria ' s governing conservative party and its policy .    3.0184748561451924
the most UNK aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the geneva convention , that is to say so - called quota refugees or un refugees .    2.5907925314941487
in actual fact , it is the other refugees , namely those outside the quota and those not covered by un aid , who need aid the most .    2.498684478373815
the committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the equal programme on identical conditions .    2.334765492129809
some members of the committee , however , supported mrs stenzel ' s proposal and wordings .    4.178049567489147
as i see it , this means that mr haider ' s politics are already casting their shadow over this parliament .    2.5544607329956066
it is therefore crucially important that the chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the equal programme .    2.9060065636932366
i want , finally , to say that i had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the austrian government but , when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees , i have no misgivings .    3.0096095715245266
i hope that the chamber will be just as committed this time .    2.5875301440794987
mr president , during the last eu financial perspective from 1994 to 1999 , when there were 13 different initiatives in operation , the interreg ii cross - border programme was an important initiative .    2.3756352100970597
the fact that the next round of structural funds 2000 - 2006 includes the interreg initiative is i believe , a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national eu member states .    3.187296513747795
the interreg i programme between 1989 and 1993 and the interreg ii programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of UNK closer social and economic development between UNK member states .    2.325825061453098
coming from the border counties in the north - west of ireland , i have seen over the years the important role which interreg i and ii have played and i am delighted to welcome interreg iii .    2.8270251550778625
the commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the interreg iii programme , which will be spent on continuing the development of cross - border economic projects between the republic of ireland and northern ireland .    2.7678387912346296
the european union has played a key role in developing the border county region in ireland over the years .    2.408720916488002
the european union is the single largest contributor , with 80 million pounds to the international fund for ireland .    2.3297675759599863
the european union contributes 75 % of the peace and reconciliation programme .    3.3406947823586144
all in all , interreg , the international fund for ireland and the peace and reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process .    2.611438288718367
mr president , i am taking the floor to speak about interreg , but i shall confine myself to a few criticisms , which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time .    2.835898141016166
we have all spoken favourably of this programme ' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation , in addition to cross - border cooperation .    2.945259308657996
however , this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50 - 80 % - will be reserved for cross - border cooperation , for interreg iiia . therefore , we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand , regarding the selection of eligible regions , is wrong and contradictory .    2.76926960812499
we hope that the commission will want to look into this and acknowledge parliament ' s position in practical terms , and not just with a formal tribute .    3.4044634163072747
cross - border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and , where exceptions have been made for maritime areas , their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other community policies .    2.297616072834611
this discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature .    2.423552667317056
this is in line with ongoing discrimination , which ignores article 158 of the treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies .    2.763688568242292
more serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as malta .    3.349636784756794
this has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the nuts iii sicilian provinces which have a frontier with malta and to include all the regions of the adriatic which share a frontier with balkan regions .    2.3162461881421703
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to express the satisfaction i have in noting that the most remote regions , including the french overseas departments , have received some attention in connection with the interreg iii initiative , opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area , even though it is true that more could have been expected , particularly with regard to access to the various strands .    2.654141567158
for a long time , probably a survival of our colonial heritage , our regions have fixed their attention on the european mainland , ignoring and even UNK their closest neighbours .    2.3360025043079373
that time is now past .    2.884306837671566
our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to , not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples , hence the UNK expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment .    2.605711667536828
this increased awareness does not , however , affect identity alone .    2.829155629472874
it is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets .    2.295823586953933
so , for example , the island of réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern africa and those of south - east asia .    2.708193437126428
it cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area , UNK it miss out on a historic opportunity , and the same applies to our regions in the caribbean .    2.9009193210280544
at last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment , the source of so much despair , if we can export to neighbouring countries the know - how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the european structural funds .    2.936876924818475
interreg appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable european union UNK into these geographical areas , giving it worldwide scope .    2.35985879954957
mr president , commissioners , i greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans - european cooperation under interreg , but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas .    2.486675811948523
i understand the commission ' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation .    2.6767764252185664
nonetheless , there are many maritime areas between which links are already established .    2.7444249386141313
various local authorities around the north sea provide a prime example of this .    2.3481888768830474
interreg could well allow UNK of such cooperation .    2.4153025812406
in consequence , i seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand a and strand b . these adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects , particularly those of an infrastructural kind .    2.3433492658732016
such measures will put maritime and UNK areas on an equal footing with other areas of the eu .    2.7065361930492515
i hope for their adoption .    2.606411553743593
mr president , our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the equal initiative so that , if you are a british UNK physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group : you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems , rather than being defined as the problem .    2.3929945814402585
there is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared .    2.4539197004419964
we also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level .    2.7282057338002526
we are concerned , therefore , as others have said , at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society ' s most excluded , by aiming for a very narrow definition of " refugee " .    2.993280085486715
my group will not be supporting those amendments .    3.0192025838028713
mr president , i am very pleased to see urban orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems .    2.224102951690896
yet , there is some risk of dilution of effort . if we pursue too many objectives , our overall effectiveness suffers .    2.4372399629013284
of course , every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case .    2.4373578383592505
i would wish urban to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation .    1.9620150208502685
for this , of course , central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy , so that the latter too can be UNK and can work UNK with the objectives of any urban programmes implemented in our countries , and so that it is not just using them as an UNK for its own shortcomings .    3.606827562191445
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i shall confine my observations to mr decourrière ' s report .    2.19863226109335
the interreg community initiative programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of european territory , most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the european union and its outlying regions .    3.165841282966344
interreg must , therefore , be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the union if we do not wish to see a two - or even three - speed european territory .    3.139515735384205
it is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities , and their representative bodies , the committee of the regions and , of course , the european parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme .    3.581669521189146
indeed , i am forced to observe that this was not the case when the commission drew up its communication , published on 13 october last year .    3.0307093068777466
even though i approve of the general guidelines of interreg iii , i feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme , financed by the erdf , and the other external cooperation funds , including in particular the european development fund , intended for acp countries .    3.163884918717824
in this connection , i should like to thank the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the edf to the list of these funds .    2.4194704938395946
the most remote regions , particularly the four french overseas departments , must be able to coordinate interreg iii and the edf in order to fund , in turn , cooperation projects with their acp neighbours in their respective geographical areas .    2.965681489188593
furthermore , i would ask the commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication .    3.344637717142136
it is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from interreg iii , just like all the other regions in the union , especially now that the UNK programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped .    3.093479795368754
finally , in conclusion , i would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand c , for interregional cooperation , even though the added value this offers the community is undeniable .    2.595851648627995
mr president , my starting point is the equal report and equality between men and women , although i must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue , which has a feeling of UNK UNK about it when you are my age , in any case .    3.1455643609435917
unfortunately , it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality .    4.237858219089492
a breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas , however .    2.8150934401802554
for me , equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a UNK work the whole time and hand the children over to a UNK , UNK an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job .    2.7386395733555364
if that is the case , we have not progressed one little bit since UNK times .    3.311706244851464
no , equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life .    2.6255595133480405
on the contrary .    2.6832921571161177
i think , therefore , that paragraph 7 contains something very central , i . e . that equal will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies .    2.35374501269428
one can only hope that it succeeds .    3.122031934587429
i should just like to say , in accordance with the rules of procedure , that if i am not here when the commission responds - not that i have asked any specific questions , but i should nonetheless hope that the commission has been paying attention - then that is because the committee on women ' s rights and equal opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision - making process at the same time as the present debate is going on .    3.0379782453245787
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , those who work on rural areas know that , of the programmes which the european union has managed , the leader programme , both leader i and leader ii , is one of its success stories , and i hope that the same will be true of leader + .    3.095517895903483
one of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the leader programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned .    2.8085948887991936
i am glad that leader + is to remain true to this underlying concept .    2.274340248514633
there is a problem , however , which we need to address together .    4.5122670883168725
because leader is a kind of UNK with a bottom - up approach , a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through leader i and ii which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were .    2.528767557617104
and because of the programme ' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from leader .    2.7173323783466934
that is why , where the good leader projects are concerned , we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued ; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable , positive component of our support to rural areas .    2.4702884504137113
of course this is also the basic idea .    3.245744118171628
it is to take new ideas and try them out in leader , with the participants on the ground , with the local organisations on the ground , with many non - governmental organisations , with the churches , with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities .    2.92566026538364
here we must ensure that the good schemes , those which are really excellent , are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work .    2.886013996991591
my request to the commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted .    3.616520443547654
there should be no attempt to have one or other organisation , which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known , pushed a little on to the sidelines , say because of official local or regional policy .    2.521832631874819
have faith in the successful results which leader has had so far .    2.3925834090592577
at the beginning it is sometimes a little like UNK a UNK if we say that a plan is too idealistic .    2.6555441550875747
and then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy , including ourselves at this level , could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well .    2.009643264254172
that was the UNK of leader , and that should please not be lost !    3.579767934337346
mr president , i welcome the equal initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups .    2.8820985280107134
women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender .    2.543760183910926
this is why specific action for women is needed , as well as mainstreaming .    2.8190001223153023
the report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work ; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed .    2.386604829490487
the involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the equal initiative and the projects .    2.9724586908397472
the development partnerships within the thematic fields , which are referred to in amendment no . 22 , would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the equal initiative .    2.8347209376709315
my group will be supporting amendment no . 22 .    2.7273938304291376
mr president , the report under discussion in the house today is doubtless of great importance .    2.7550086553747515
in addition to the objectives it is working towards , the strong point of the community initiative interreg for the 2000 - 2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the european union to include new eastern european and mediterranean countries .    2.7307117181826563
in my opinion , it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the european union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas .    2.803387969433172
indeed , these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the union .    3.1039258610904548
it is precisely with this in mind that i tabled some amendments which i consider to be of the utmost importance , and that the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism has subsequently taken up .    2.8809337199365546
they call for the areas eligible for cross - border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the adriatic , as well as to the sicilian provinces which have a frontier with malta - an applicant country - which , UNK , are not currently included in strand a , annex 1 .    2.840341182381251
i am confident that commissioner barnier and the president of the european commission will duly consider parliament ' s position on the matter , in accordance with the code of conduct .    3.580075372429345
there are fundamental advantages for the whole of europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions .    3.1293024299487855
finally , it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the interreg initiative and the existing community programmes , which are significant for external policy , as a UNK for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes .    3.279563364301243
mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , leader i was an UNK success due , in particular , to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the commission and the local operators .    2.987749758803364
it is , i think , regrettable that the commission could not make a similar assessment of leader ii , regarding the quality of the projects , the quantity of appropriations spent and , most especially , the UNK of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered .    3.084764544095104
i am pleased to see , however , that under leader + , new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development .    2.6980956998719097
i feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment , in order to promote employment .    2.989414143336943
the time is now right , i think , to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation .    2.914798204031095
it is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for leader ii .    2.6296619113526454
nonetheless , if the opportunity for member states to determine the areas , within the scope of this initiative , remains available , then the commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas .    3.5830112236906424
there must , of course , be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups .    2.882957225405427
i also feel there are grounds for ensuring , in particular , that the financial channels of states or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some lags to become UNK under leader ii .    2.423406806658117
mr president , as a member from one of the outermost regions , i must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned , because of the debate on two community initiatives , urban and interreg .    4.022360822711688
i would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed , firstly , in the case of urban , at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various european cities , and , in the case of interreg , at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the european union , particularly by including the outermost regions in strands b and c .    2.978122548123417
like the rapporteur , we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand iiia .    3.3205423640789027
with regard to interreg , we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a european monitoring centre concerned with cooperation .    3.807732597575357
i would like to thank the rapporteurs , particularly mr decourrière , for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments .    2.380144296925444
i hope that the commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making .    3.607501098923541
mr president , with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon , i would like to concentrate strictly on one of them , that is , the urban programme .    3.624920481770047
it is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the european parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained .    3.2497512434399494
the commission proposed removing it and other initiatives , but parliament ' s proposal and the sensitivity of the commission itself at the time led to the urban initiative being retained .    3.40988871166695
i believe that we should be pleased about this .    2.9810155491616377
but what were the commission ' s arguments , from commissioner monika wulf - mathies and director - general UNK UNK in particular , for eliminating the urban programme ?    2.8613054190674867
its argument was one of priority .    2.864486141590115
the urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our UNK and UNK it with a programme which has such a small budget .    3.070234091227766
today the programme is in place and therefore i believe we have achieved something important , that distinguishing mark of the european union called the urban programme .    3.101088694806191
however , i would like to address commissioner barnier and support the argument of commissioner wulf - mathies and the director - general , because i think they were absolutely right .    2.496948445887703
the urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds .    2.692839486617244
the amount of budget required by our cities - where 80 % of the european population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in europe , i believe , clearly indicates that the european dimension should be taken into account and that this urban programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail , not to prioritise and , therefore , not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities , by means of european funds .    3.028868106144633
in welcoming the cross - sectoral approach embodied in the new equal initiative , it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which UNK against disabled people in particular : physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility , visual information systems which exclude blind workers , working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems .    2.0872984434729824
organisations of disabled people and disabled people ' s non - disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision - making .    2.5025628781458447
that is why this parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution , to ensure that member states cannot ignore any one target group .    2.949583105936591
disabled people have too often been left off the list .    2.504487993405469
because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group .    2.101933973276883
equal remains crucial also to regions like my own , in the east of england , outside the principal funds of objective i . we have had an extra incentive to take up community initiative funding and an excellent record in response .    2.651143075045653
former adapt projects range from the core project , which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in UNK , to projects to raise standards in small businesses in UNK in essex .    2.7087653930668827
we have seen the now project helping 70 women to return to work in suffolk , many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the european parliament in brussels .    2.767715878857223
equal remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower - skilled jobs are being shed , which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market .    2.461807958903993
finally , a word on interreg .    2.592138639707049
it really is quite UNK that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter - regional links .    2.4139971260386335
during this period the ports of great UNK and UNK on the essex - suffolk - UNK coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the netherlands .    2.372579570237812
i urge parliament to support our amendment no 2 , which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas , particularly on maritime borders .    2.9019726273853905
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for the information of the house , mr president , i should like to make a clarification .    3.063807647141479
chancellor schüssel ' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by chancellor UNK .    2.4859779445899446
there is no change in refugee policy in austria !    2.569476204656612
rural areas make up over 80 % of the eu ' s territory and 25 % of the population live in them .    3.2666438199492585
i attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because i am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone ; i refer , in short , to the multifunctionality of rural areas .    2.4250477830158212
i should like to welcome in particular the new leader + programme because of its comprehensive nature .    2.7210606560274715
in the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the eu .    3.206547532178219
this across - the - board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way .    2.5582437599107886
in the future , funding will no longer come from three funds but from the eaggf guidance section alone .    2.5019057115585612
it will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the eaggf is supposed to be an effective financial instrument .    3.506887686640285
greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness , because the money should not be UNK UNK .    3.0732558479180927
in addition , i should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy .    2.400791912207476
there is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside .    2.626428821017742
that is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers .    2.5380462211306516
leader + should supplement already existing programmes , avoid UNK and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible .    2.2729420800264206
in this way , leader + can , together with the programmes under regulation ( ec ) no UNK / 99 , consolidate the second pillar of the cap even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside .    2.695753572860322
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am not always proud of the UNK that goes on here in parliament , but the urban programme is one of the best examples of our work : it was created following an initiative in parliament .    3.0617367505049256
the commission would have abolished urban , but this time parliament drew the longer straw .    2.465585704143983
it is good that urban is to continue , as it has had good results at local level .    2.749357593627824
the problems in europe ' s urban areas are getting worse ; fortunately , we now have consensus with the commission .    2.8110836063730518
the majority of the population of europe live in cities , and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves .    2.775162523250792
there is an immense risk of exclusion .    2.5362729878073553
in many cities in france and england there are now UNK , breeding grounds for many sorts of problems .    2.405680765168522
none of us wants south american type UNK in europe .    2.370066914762516
we have to act now , before it is too late .    2.645329275147685
our cities are also of decisive importance for europe ' s economy .    3.207387402318842
we always come back to the same basic problem in europe : our economy does not support the individual sufficiently , nor is it sufficiently dynamic .    2.616637559164854
the economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow - citizens and our environment .    3.5082976004548483
this is not policy ; it is life ' s simple logic .    2.68537470016828
it is good that spending has become focused , as otherwise the UNK gets scattered to the four winds .    2.0540803222360666
now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle - size towns and cities , as they do not have enough resources .    3.0943287866186706
in this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas ; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand .    2.7960437631167023
the basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship , as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally .    2.6734055660038325
granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well : there will be enough to drink for a while , but tomorrow the well will be dry again .    2.139465794574491
mr president , with the implementation of interreg iii , european cooperation policy is entering a new phase .    3.0199244321471954
in the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation , the european union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions , particularly in eastern and southern europe .    2.77574464257083
the union ' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development , but - on the contrary - an opportunity , a bridge to more fruitful cooperation .    2.7594507136725537
by means of amendments adopted in committee , parliament has tried to supplement the commission ' s work , by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid , and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in southern europe .    2.878425743840648
in its draft guidelines , the commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past .    2.5976074130297553
this is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the mediterranean countries .    3.2572932111235593
as president prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000 - 2005 , boosting the barcelona process is a priority for the union , and the interreg iii initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective .    3.0968857793663367
in congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work , we can but hope that the commission will duly take into consideration the proposals parliament has put forward , in accordance with the commitments made under the code of conduct on the implementation of structural policies , and that it will confirm , with fitting amendments , the transformation of this community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries .    2.948159991368841
mr president , from this year until the year 2006 around eur 200 billion is available for the structural funds , but only UNK % is set aside for the community initiatives , interreg , leader , urban and equal .    2.5919759732791516
that is a reduction of UNK % compared with the previous UNK .    2.8362755677359934
no more than eur 2 . 8 billion is provided for equal , as mrs stenzel ' s balanced report makes clear .    2.603918773298698
this makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing .    2.855606988606216
how are priorities supposed to be set here ?    3.1077281867015323
there is agreement on the principle that marginalisation , discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced .    2.9619461056844836
transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs .    3.0026456566516764
i have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the taos . criticism of the previous commission ' s work was particularly severe , legitimately so , with regard to these technical assistance offices .    2.6700515449480218
our committee on employment and social affairs was , after all , in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to leonardo .    2.314172629034912
the commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under equal either .    2.458969612964297
it can only approve member states ' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria : firstly , integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships , whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account ; secondly , the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local , regional and national authorities , training institutions , universities , ngos , the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership , and thirdly , methods and models of UNK innovative character .    2.4635149389994773
the commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work , of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices .    2.964816027298564
only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved .    2.5821741269554055
mr president , i want to refer to the commission proposals on the budget line to promote the cap .    3.551011550590621
on 26 october 1999 the european commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the cap .    3.256710981135569
this proposal will remove the current budget line UNK - UNK and create a new budget heading b1 - UNK .    2.7481651629628416
actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the eu and also create stronger links with eu candidate countries and the outside world are important .    2.5487421839516005
therefore i am putting forward these amendments to parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme .    2.8864087634717057
given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well - informed about developments in the common agricultural policy .    3.066598708102479
informing and training young farmers at european level is vitally important .    2.7654092198059765
i would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst european young farmers .    2.6424935208482467
regarding information and training , in the past this budget line has been allocated for information , communication and training .    3.1297965814192263
i feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at european level about the cap .    2.4718062596453967
such european training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the cap to make sound business decisions for the future .    2.402628982663697
therefore i am putting forward three amendments .    2.343469082988595
i would urge parliament to support them .    2.734227160470736
secondly , to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres , within these old quarters of our cities .    2.2192989816800472
there is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully UNK , with new UNK , with newly paved road UNK , all UNK and beautiful , if we are not able to fill them with activity and , therefore , employment .    2.708983251175159
i would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators , but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment , or to put it another way , projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs .    2.6467624337590676
thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families , because man is not made for the law , but rather law is made for man .    2.709579621342258
these areas of our cities are often home to single - UNK families , elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity , and families facing difficulties ; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society .    2.0061701713880136
these people live in areas which should benefit from these projects .    2.524873874800844
if we have success in this threefold sense , i believe that these families , these people , these european citizens , will believe more in europe , and this seems to me to be very important because , ultimately , the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in european life .    2.9322892269363225
. ( fr ) mr president , before my friends and fellow commissioners , franz fischler and UNK diamantopoulou , in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest , i would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of urban and interreg , which many of you have brought up and discussed .    2.8325248510818954
straight away i should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees , from all the committees , but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives .    3.2586851120619063
this is particularly true of what mrs mccarthy said about urban . i should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and i do not see why i in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her , for all you owe her as far as this is initiative , as well as , more generally , all we owe parliament .    2.800008146851647
i am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the european parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties , in favour of sustainable urban development , involving at the same time this integrated approach , which we value , to handle the economic , social and environmental aspects simultaneously .    3.039450828719335
some other points of agreement highlighted in mrs mccarthy ' s report , the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention , the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and , finally , the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes , on the basis of a real partnership .    2.7846980895456146
having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the commission ' s proposals and parliament and , having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions , i should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made , with apologies if i cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name .    2.8815181762218716
i think however that you will all recognise your own comments .    2.5693587566505713
firstly on the subject of the urban programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns , which a number of you termed arbitrary .    2.9643289706895923
i can understand your concern .    2.7288532808588366
i have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the urban programme conditional upon certain guarantees , firstly on concentration - i am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or , in exceptional cases , 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding : we must keep to eur 500 per inhabitant so that the european union action may be both effective and clear , and so that it does not resemble a sort of UNK of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities .    2.546952992191124
regarding a second matter , now , relating to the additional criteria , which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas . here , too , i am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project .    2.817384148317411
third point : specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women , but also immigrants and refugees , must be envisaged .    2.799793517270824
this concern , ladies and gentlemen , lies at the very heart of our urban initiative , and i am willing to UNK the text , if necessary , in order to make this message clearer yet .    3.688779791199125
regarding urban , i should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention , first of all , the selection procedure .    2.8298435035471354
some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic , more transparent , and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding .    3.4115277258498384
ladies and gentlemen , on this point we must make it clear : in the context of subsidiarity , the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for urban is primarily the responsibility of the member states .    2.9945966722622357
as far as the commission is concerned , it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload , but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes , indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did .    3.2752622185161804
a second observation , the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes .    2.692709353205879
i have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme .    2.460972152610665
this cannot , however , be grounds for an extension of the original time limit .    3.0989471894765668
let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months .    2.951708680336341
this time limit , which indeed is identical to the one we granted for interreg and for the objective 2 docups , should normally be adequate , i feel , for drawing up a programme , which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage .    2.6100547152688574
with regard to urban , i should like to conclude with a final observation .    2.8418934275671672
one of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the urban initiative .    2.8345518589505527
i agree completely .    2.78763196595848
i myself expressed my concern at the meeting of ministers for regional and urban planning , a concern to which i devote myself , that in the docups and the csfs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate , my concern , as i said , that , apart from the urban initiative , urban issues should be addressed in all the objective 1 and objective 2 programmes , and i believe i can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them , beyond the scope of urban , in all structural fund programming .    2.8594699822101175
but , as for the future , since we must look ahead , i am extremely concerned to see how urban is going to be implemented in practical terms , and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn , because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be , for future financial perspectives , a new european regional planning policy .    3.35735993397028
i am not forgetting , and we cannot forget , that 80 % of the citizens of europe today live in towns and that is why this urban instrument is extremely important .    3.1258494684503964
let me repeat what i have said , we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming .    3.026555016224176
i should now , mr president , like to bring up the subject of interreg and to thank the rapporteur , francis decourrière , in the same way that i UNK arlene mccarthy , for the quality and relevance of his work .    3.6329453780149437
he stressed a number of points , with which we may indicate our agreement , as many of you did too - the importance of this trans - european cooperation , with its three strands , cross - border , transnational , interregional ; the added value to the community provided by interreg , its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds , and the truly cross - border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations ; the importance of common structures and what , in discussing another debate which begins today , the intergovernmental conference , i termed the common european spirit which we have to strengthen , and here , with interreg , thanks to interreg , is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity ; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners .    2.841869504936847
having made these general observations , i should like to focus on your main comments with regard to interreg .    2.869918428352757
the first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative .    3.1755463509757913
you comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date , stressing , particularly your rapporteur , the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted .    2.3471250901166743
it is true , i admit it , and you are well aware of the reasons , ladies and gentlemen .    3.358007165367537
there is a delay in adopting the interreg guidelines in march or april 2000 .    2.3814091899602796
i accept this ; i take note of it as you do .    2.8259549617642534
i note , however , that the member states and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for interreg iii and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now .    2.880403883742962
i also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and i can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 january , if the programme is presented before 30 april .    2.4409755124398917
so much for the first comment .    3.503786513824107
as to the second comment : regarding the non - comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand b , i wish to inform you , to confirm , that i have asked the commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects , particularly in favour of small - and medium - sized businesses and of cultural heritage , in the list of schemes eligible under strand b and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one .    3.0420401359781457
third point : interregional cooperation , the importance of strand c . the commission shares the observations made by this house regarding the importance of strand c , interregional cooperation .    2.870034046673043
as your rapporteur has requested , i shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand .    3.2026716881106387
fourth observation : the european observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office .    2.587411884413638
as you requested , i have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the commission on the service UNK systems .    3.227471523866142
but , ladies and gentlemen , if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a UNK at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials ' jobs needed to do this work , because somebody will have to do it and i cannot keep UNK the same staff indefinitely , at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre - accession structural instrument ( ispa ) and in order to ensure that , the community appropriations for which i am responsible , often in partnership or on terms of UNK with member states , are monitored better , with discipline and transparency .    2.768659739672025
now to the implementation of interreg , a subject mentioned by many of you , and the potential eligibility under strand a , ' cross - border cooperation ' , of schemes in the adriatic , on behalf of sicily or for the most remote regions , the commission , ladies and gentlemen , understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points .    3.183027861134511
i therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand b : ' integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions ' , so as to cover , in what i think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions .    2.410815688749639
in addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the member states : greater financial flexibility between strand a and strand b . thanks to these two UNK , especially the first , i can say that the commission is willing to examine the case of italian regions and regions of third countries around the adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under interreg , and with other instruments too , as soon as they become available .    3.150808462675874
i have decided , in the end , that the most remote regions , to which i attach particular importance , will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of interreg , with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other member state regions .    3.184999094271728
i also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between interreg and the edf , particularly for the caribbean and the indian ocean .    2.62986673868832
all this should make it possible for us , apart from the objective 1 appropriations and also with them , to confirm the role of ' active frontier ' of the union .    3.2225618262169706
i adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the union are actually active frontiers of the union , even if , or precisely because , they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear .    2.8590733298838122
another point : the coordination between interreg , phare , tacis and meda .    2.318054382756548
it is true , once again , and i accept this objectively , that there are still real legal problems .    3.5208291044838145
i do not want to minimise these , but progress is being made as far as strand a cooperation with candidate countries is concerned , even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain .    2.876502779129077
the commission must continue along these lines .    2.576894425995184
i am making a personal commitment to do so .    2.5456515386152643
an initial joint phare / cip committee is to meet in february to assess this coordination , and let me confirm my UNK and availability with regard to this , together with my colleagues and fellow commissioners verheugen , patten and poul nielson .    2.484771804381969
finally , on the subject of technical assistance , on which your rapporteur and several of you commented . it goes without saying that the commission will adhere to the terms of article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance , if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general .    3.054190623100522
according to the general regulations , however , any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a community initiative must be proposed under article 20 , and not article 23 .    2.815580175341725
this means that the ceiling of 0 . 25 % mentioned in article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance .    2.762419814736742
my conclusion regarding interreg , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , is that these community initiatives for which i am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this . they also UNK a real european regional planning policy within our enlarged union .    2.850708213822507
the commission attaches the greatest importance to this , just as you yourselves do .    2.736898545817273
i remain at your service in order , when the time comes , to present the report of previous planning which you request , but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning .    3.146693029630013
repeating my thanks to each and every one of you , and also particularly to arlene mccarthy and francis decourrière , i should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar : only eur 700 million for urban , but this is better than nothing ; eur 4 billion 800 millions for interreg .    2.43236634595426
so we are working within this framework and not outside it .    2.7076817915810203
on the subject of these two initiatives , then , with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives , let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the european parliament and its committees .    2.866039506976795
everything that i have just said , ladies and gentlemen , demonstrates that the commission is resolved to taken the views of parliament into account .    3.4179910934557545
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like firstly to thank mr procacci for his report .    2.567742586001252
however , i should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the leader + initiative .    3.1972559372146874
this initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas , ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models .    2.396483000548695
i am also pleased that parliament essentially supports the commission ' s view that leader + should be applied in all rural areas , that overriding priorities should be introduced and that , above all , active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged .    2.6828544979862525
in addition , i note that parliament shares the commission ' s view that the preferred form for implementing leader + is the use of global grants .    2.7883213401143445
turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today , i can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in leader + .    3.384317831225206
the various groups , be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment , have the possibility of taking part in drafting the commission directives .    2.583449958640728
and there will not be less funds available than in the current period either ; there will be more .    3.4470575374487313
i should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new .    2.862395766069193
there was also an observatory under leader i and leader ii .    2.3404549226145983
it has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual leader groups .    2.435707278596417
the cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2 % of the leader budget .    2.8763607458886615
as far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned , i might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy , which means , in our view , that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of leader .    4.077497671970868
i now come to the content of the report .    3.0322564717351304
in point 14 , parliament calls on the commission to submit an evaluation report on leader ii immediately .    2.621261977270307
i should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because , as you know , it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for leader ii funds to be disbursed .    2.9676761010916666
we therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme ' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation .    2.938641880902484
we will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it .    2.5887233519856414
in point 18 , parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives .    2.098335957625123
in response i can only say that this already exists .    2.9781827730849297
it has already been compiled by the commission and i can make a copy available to any member of this house who is interested .    3.325358249570403
in point 21 , parliament stresses that the guidelines in leader + now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start .    3.1130621202087094
i can only fully share your concern .    2.460441371824522
as soon as the opinion is adopted here in parliament , the guidelines for leader + will again be presented to the star committee so that the member states can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 november .    3.1980529593651976
i assume that the commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in march or april .    3.8130716574264634
and as soon as these are published in the official journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit leader + programmes .    2.621555923661168
i believe that it is important to point out one thing : expenditure effected under leader + is eligible from the time that the commission programme starts running .    2.733798555799225
for all programmes submitted before 30 april of this year it will be possible to UNK the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 january .    3.1785578359839044
finally , under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines .    2.4979338258015313
having given them thorough consideration , i can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2 , 4 , 5 and 7 are acceptable to the commission and are adopted .    2.8318473784871196
the proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under leader + is a maximum of 5 months .    2.443036659345477
the amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has , in our view , been overtaken by events because , following consultations with the representatives of the member states in the star committee , this point has already been UNK along the lines proposed by parliament .    2.7393833848214078
that therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3 .    2.362060609439333
the commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the commission itself had originally proposed .    2.5714603902447393
i must add , however , that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the member states .    2.5193537520295384
an amendment was therefore made in the committee , but the commission will now again take account of parliament ' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form .    3.2855225221090585
it will also continue to fight for member states ' acceptance of this .    3.411680044884289
i will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled .    2.3870519061753916
here there are only three which the commission cannot accept , amendments nos 3 , 12 and 13 .    2.8391076457668114
it can accept all of the others either in full or in essence .    2.7863078179127263
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the equal initiative in the european parliament just at this time .    3.4414660535659394
recently , because of political developments in austria , there is growing unease within europe . political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue .    3.051477630306023
it is worth stressing that both parliament and the commission must put forward specific policies .    2.8874653330534685
we need specific proposals , both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies .    2.699776427406417
so i will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti - discrimination package as soon as possible .    2.4339224504651686
i now come to the equal initiative , which is , of course , based on article 13 .    3.926129082822754
the equal initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of article 13 , namely the fight against discrimination based on race , gender , age , and special needs .    2.6221352128254094
i would particularly like to congratulate mrs stenzel , because her effort to reach agreement on the equal initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex , both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue .    3.057984021205594
the first comment , which has been made by many others too , is whether women should be mentioned separately .    2.9471052688985737
i agree that article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about , but that is how the treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination , discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place .    2.282726157340923
so on the basis of the treaty as it stands today , the equal initiative is structured in that way .    3.8515255630977485
i would like to remind you , however , that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared , the fifth programme for equality between men and women .    2.5776370407399716
i have classified the issues raised by the honourable members into four groups .    2.5170553055159117
firstly , the enlargement of the thematic areas .    2.837248979206833
as in employment strategy , there are four thematic areas : employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunities , and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the european parliament ' s proposals .    3.0262543224254648
to answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination , i will say that the initiative states clearly that the member states must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination .    2.9041503561471838
the second subject is flexibility and simplification .    2.4567687590446265
i agree with mr leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand .    2.5724405288664567
that is why the services are already trying to revise the text , simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp .    2.2825954569254203
as regards the subject of flexibility , we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace , and at the thematic level where , for example , cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector .    2.4988066201417816
this would allow member states great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs .    2.3704611070171167
of course , a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the member states , and a network which will assist the exchange of experience .    3.159352089660565
finally , i would like to mention technical assistance .    2.754706767456485
we are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available .    2.5102864411959414
first , funding for preparation ; second , implementation ; third , mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience , and fourth , technical assistance .    2.297278634385725
since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided , we must say that external offices will be used .    3.4628881769524105
as mr barnier too pointed out , it is impossible for all the work previously done by external UNK to be done now by the commission ' s staff .    3.6877301643817493
the aim at national and european level is to establish large action groups by tender , with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested . we would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised .    2.6304353465013968
i want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible , both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned , in other words , we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000 .    3.250434700565888
thank you , commissioner .    2.120450226877885
i shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the bureau and to the appropriate committees .    2.453440362127961
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at noon .    2.0461248255720874
( the sitting was closed at 8 . 40 p . m . )    1.8496684300017188
approval of the minutes of the two previous sittings    3.430676591835175
the minutes of the sittings of thursday 3 february and monday 14 february have been distributed .    1.9592186941387784
the minutes of 3 february were originally distributed in brussels so perhaps this is why some members did not receive them .    2.3640429144671904
are there any comments ?    2.1658741078678636
( the minutes were approved )    2.0038305127267746
madam president , my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part - session on monday UNK at 5 . 00 p . m .    2.294067800697647
yesterday it was impossible for myself and many meps to be here , because the 2 . 15 p . m . air france flight , which normally brings us here , was cancelled , with no explanation from the airline , and we therefore arrived very late .    2.3924320369941996
if air france insists on boycotting the european parliament , we should take measures to prevent this occurring again .    3.3094809548659057
thank you , mr medina ortega .    2.6378401851293645
i too wholeheartedly regret this situation .    2.52529245252301
would you be so kind as to write to me so that i have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both air france and the french government ?    2.6718368417112455
this situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly .    2.9118001769996855
madam president , i had the same experience as mr medina ortega yesterday .    2.5453321982910637
i feel that the french authorities - which have the honour of housing the european parliament in strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the union .    2.8129229207406197
absolutely , mr napolitano . thank you .    2.7362444937235133
madam president , off the subject of aeroplane delays , i wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the group of the greens / european free alliance , UNK lucas , who is a british member .    2.4167015087107875
although her identity was noted and her position as a member of the european parliament was very apparent , she was still held in custody all day .    2.4867456935575873
i regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the british authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that mrs lucas receives an apology . i have written to you in this respect together with my colleague , mrs hautala .    2.820501291895947
thank you , mr lannoye .    2.6850091038378614
i have received your letter and have already contacted the british permanent representative .    2.1454049589015414
madam president , i should like to make a request in connection with today ' s vote which i started to make yesterday during the debate on the equal report .    3.005598196867296
i should like the vote on the community equal initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point .    2.8579423697955146
i am optimistic and quite UNK and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on equal .    2.1184549486947235
we just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and i would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning .    2.4992122099349734
madam president , to follow on from the point that mr lannoye made : mrs lucas was arrested just outside glasgow for protesting against the UNK base at faslane .    2.2516102924554384
i have a lot of sympathy with that protest .    2.9554701471505074
i have , however , no sympathy for mrs lucas trying to hide behind her parliamentary immunity .    2.467701000472676
i have also been arrested for protesting at faslane .    2.5189694453620706
i did not hide behind any immunity .    2.644466100986134
i took the punishment that came to me .    2.624869764795935
mrs lucas should do the same .    2.819159592284556
madam president , i would like to comment on the request mrs stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the community initiative equal until tomorrow .    2.5706611788260987
in fact , this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee , and , given that it is a major commission proposal , which refers to the agreements we reached last year , i consider it admissible .    3.6163542298453066
we agree with mrs stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups , so that parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible .    2.728369430916605
does anyone want to speak against mrs stenzel ' s request , as supported by mrs UNK ?    2.5266876737820048
if not , then we will proceed to the vote .    2.5365324034602743
( parliament approved the request )    2.6516917968810287
madam president , under rule 29 ( 4 ) you should be kept informed by political groups of any members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group .    2.0778082875960817
have you received any notification of any members leaving the group of the european people ' s party or does the austrian people ' s party continue to sit in that political group ?    2.340749678940891
mr corbett , i have not received any notification .    3.52615151109286
madam president , i am UNK at mr corbett ' s reaction .    2.528594865453562
he should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here .    1.9810383655449595
we are solidly with our austrian friends who have proven to be good europeans in the past .    2.071449837900502
they have our full support .    2.7059246259290926
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
agenda    3.614422713529094
with regard to the agenda for thursday , following a request made yesterday in plenary , i propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6 . 00 p . m . when the vote will take place .    2.3094494587968066
( parliament gave its assent )    2.0684259806454803
commission ' s strategic objectives and legislative programme    3.764773356962994
the next item is the joint debate on the commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000 .    2.5528492468592576
i therefore immediately give the floor to the president of the commission , mr prodi .    3.078969212495183
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , a five - year programme is an extremely important undertaking , and this is why i preferred that you be given the UNK text of the speech , which is available in four languages .    2.91807311609972
to respect my speaking time , i will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme : a programme for the UNK of a new legislature and a new century , when it is right and proper to see europe in a broader perspective , a europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation .    3.0761206476333838
let us remember that for half a century , europe has provided us with peace , security and freedom and a united europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity .    2.4860282285137547
we are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery , which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies .    2.5597538861987608
this recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made , but it comes at a price : it follows the restructuring of public accounts in european countries , which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries , banks and public services , even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go .    2.540792907310757
nevertheless , despite these aspects , european citizens are disappointed and concerned : by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough ; by a europe trailing behind in technology , and UNK falling even further behind , and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too ; by the european institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times , starting with the commission itself .    2.514931009049032
the crisis in the commission was , in fact , a crucial point in the relationship between europe and its citizens , and the low turnout at the european elections was a worrying indication of this .    3.6007232183222593
even stronger still , however , is the sense of insecurity , the feeling of being UNK in a new world that is moving forwards , a world which is completely changing , where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference .    2.6091671647027876
this is not the first time this has happened : europe was once confronted with a similar transformation , an explosion of its markets , a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world .    2.392573428166623
i am referring to the UNK century when the discovery of america turned everything upside down .    2.233690074608156
some countries - such as france and spain - managed to meet the challenge , giving rise to great nation states ; other countries - such as italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium : headway in science , technology , economic progress , defence structures and military organisation , philosophy and literature .    2.058865947555284
today , europe is facing a similar challenge , and we know that , just as history has been UNK in the past , it will not be UNK in the present .    4.664210493837829
in this context of wholesale change , and in order to prevent our nation states UNK again , in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges , europe needs to be economically strong , because globalisation demands unity , because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at european level too .    2.4158070135063845
but more vital still is a europe that feels strong in the political arena .    2.6650854419190697
in years past , the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions , the UNK of european life .    3.1681185475920244
today , the new frontiers of european integration are political frontiers : common foreign and security policy , justice and internal security , and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based .    2.7110747111374116
the commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000 - 2005 , a programme that was immediately sent to the european parliament and with which you are already familiar , so i will not go into detail about it now .    2.9059720063334615
some of you may find it lacks detail , but no political structure sets out detailed five - year programmes .    2.4694073317113814
this is the european union , not the soviet union .    3.6095710753690455
our programme highlights the major points of reference , the major areas for action : firstly , the development of new forms of governance for europe ; secondly , extension and enlargement of the area of peace , freedom , and security ; thirdly , the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy ; fourthly , safeguarding and improving quality of life .    2.819615665631578
these will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years .    2.4648016792852405
with regard to the first area - new forms of governance for europe - you already know that the commission has undertaken to produce a white paper and not a full legislative text since , in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact , the commission is first of all preparing for a debate ; we will subsequently discuss the content with you ; this will give rise to a policy document , and finally , a legislative document .    2.9937094854157054
this is an effective , transparent way to proceed and involve all the european institutions and the citizens of europe .    2.985742050085035
this white paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us , an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions , rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at union level when the member states number 25 or 30 , and what will be the best thing to do at individual state level , at regional level and at local government level .    2.6260259305917732
but it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink : as i said a few moments ago , it is also economic and political globalisation itself .    2.918265568977935
we must govern europe in such a way as to make us more efficient , to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved , starting with the important issue of the involvement of women .    2.7201874034945885
one of the main differences in the comparison made recently between europe and the united states was not so much job mobility or risk capital , as women ' s involvement in economic life , an issue that has much more prominence in the united states than in europe . this is a field where europe has , nevertheless , always been in the vanguard .    2.878410473231825
we therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind , and all the institutions - commission , parliament , council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies .    2.86998642664911
we shall therefore get straight back to work on this white paper , although in order to finish it , we shall have to wait for the results of the intergovernmental conference , and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001 .    3.4081140869453725
it will not be a philosophical paper , but a practical paper , full of focused proposals .    2.7794756943434202
we - the commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink , and we shall therefore do two things : we are , and will continue to be , fully committed to internal reform , and we shall rethink our policies in detail .    3.8918036725329883
i have asked all the commissioners - and i shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can UNK .    2.8376867933816072
the commission must define what its fundamental activities are , what it must concentrate on and shed its non - essential activities , thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co - operative relationship with individual countries , regions and local communities .    1.930275282684337
so we shall be freeing up new resources , but - i fear , and i want to state this before parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will , in turn , be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks : i am thinking of enlargement , the new sector of justice and home affairs , health issues and environmental matters .    2.9699133141702534
when that time comes , when we have used up all our resources , i shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources , but what i am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources , we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on .    3.09352105528736
as for internal reform , you well know how committed my commission has been to this since day one .    2.414584542284258
i know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform , if it does not become more efficient , if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors , starting with the sector in which the worst UNK have built up in the past - external aid .    3.2975272970084837
providing aid rapidly , when it is needed , saves human lives ; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all .    2.4758603433929522
when i speak about external aid , my thoughts immediately turn to the balkans . there is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground , an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems .    2.383756089733705
my thoughts also turn to bernard kouchner ' s efforts , of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication , but i also think of new events , such as croatia , where the situation has changed in a few weeks : the european institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only bosnia ' s problems , but more particularly serbia ' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around serbia .    2.7742174203050323
this is the new element that we must help to bring to the balkans .    3.1589165829082715
it is contradictory to offer aid to romania and bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to UNK their greatest resource .    2.0691201383542963
we must UNK the river and , in view of this , over the next few days the commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem .    3.3087204018506333
we have done a lot in the balkans : the new european reconstruction agency for kosovo , the balkans task force and new regulations to speed up procedures .    2.8954353230386225
nevertheless , we definitely have to do more .    2.8398862366907887
we must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the european union ; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries - old isolation ; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic , pluralist society in these countries with institutions , public structures , police forces and a structured civil society , but , above all , we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region , as regards both politics and the economy .    2.7020179778116526
if we do not do this , we shall have failed in our duty .    3.2631975534375344
remember that the marshall plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources : it was even more effective because it made us europeans work together towards a new horizon ; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy .    2.288931809738082
we are clearly , once again , returning to enlargement , which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security , peace and freedom .    2.9657148652248253
we have made many promises in this regard , but i believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread .    2.9500661029336497
indeed , enlargement , which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - i am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete , objective criteria , and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and , to an even greater degree , public opinion in our own member states .    2.7162553647221004
there will be friendship , calm , openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process .    2.316608422645205
i repeat : we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own member states with even greater UNK .    2.9571737202337247
our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement , or at the balkans .    2.5486972343375847
there are certain other key issues : relations with ukraine , relations with russia , relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly , the important question of relations with the southern mediterranean which will be a crucial point for european history , and for security and peace in europe for future generations . in this regard , we have a responsibility towards the whole of africa .    2.973316351080929
in recent times , africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help , but nothing tangible has yet been achieved . in recent years in africa , we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy , but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes .    2.2147557085508534
africa is , for us , a worrying topic for discussion . we therefore have another duty at international level , which has already been proposed by the commissioner responsible for trade : the undertaking to relaunch the millennium round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries , not just in terms of writing off debts , but also via the unilateral opening - up to trade with the poorest countries in the world , with a great deal of willingness on our part , which we had already proposed prior to seattle but which we could not put into practice .    3.1882597859870185
we need to provide alternative answers , otherwise episodes such as those seen in seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of europe ' s positive roles in history .    2.327197508458247
all over the world , europe ' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities .    3.5707985451989286
we should remember that we , the european union , are a union of minorities : we are all a minority within europe .    3.538630671875339
there are concerns even within the fifteen , concerns which may even surface again in the next decade .    2.8410908220079256
i am referring to the situation in austria , where the commission has remained true to its role , being duty - bound to work towards the cohesion of the union , but also the unwavering guardian of the treaties , ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy , law and respect for minorities .    3.0587421238905255
some people have criticised me over the UNK message i sent to chancellor schüssel .    2.418458433456997
UNK the letter : the reference to the fundamental values of the union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from article 6 of the treaty , i repeat , article 6 of the treaty .    2.982247047955468
i would also ask you whether you believe that any other european head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the commission when they were elected .    2.6046840634674764
this is what we wish to do : maintain our role as a supranational structure , maintain the role conferred on us by the treaties , but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts .    2.513056101513001
last november , the commission tabled a proposal for an anti - racism directive .    3.2290468401150436
i would ask the council to adopt it swiftly and i would ask parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion .    2.6117540708592384
i will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme : the economy and quality of life .    2.5720384652189288
i have already talked about the economy : we well know which basic ingredients will set europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs .    2.0759116804255
we must continue to keep inflation under control , proceed with liberalisation , ensure more competition , encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies ; push forward with science , and push back scientific boundaries , and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science .    2.035765451343318
the forthcoming lisbon summit on these issues - dissemination of technology , employment - will be a decisive summit .    2.682104240677761
it has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind .    3.0841531944658094
we are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers .    2.217725549201899
finally , our last commitment is to improve quality of life .    2.532679728343896
we have opened this chapter with the white paper on food safety : we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector .    2.5322677580882247
the erika oil slick and the contamination of the danube demonstrates the pressing need for european scale intervention to safeguard the environment .    2.3561461721086823
the time has come to discuss , and then establish , a body for emergency civil protection in europe .    2.345793975664948
i think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen .    2.2926155521268337
these are the challenges that we - the commission but also all the other european institutions - are facing .    2.9332070090151205
how will we judge , ladies and gentlemen , madam president , the five years of our mandate ?    3.3973545982510607
how are we going to assess the results of these five years ?    2.990677594515908
i do not know , but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together .    2.6046628469454407
let us take a very simple parameter : turnout at the next european elections .    2.231202215623768
if it is higher than at the previous elections , it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge .    3.195757657154962
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , we are faced with all these major political challenges , but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway , we are also faced with major opportunities .    2.7625549232161353
madam president , mr president of the commission , the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate .    2.6723336122363808
we also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document .    2.491583747755657
and we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which president prodi has just given .    2.7675640097414362
we read in the conclusions in the document that the five - year term of office of the prodi commission will be a time of major changes .    3.322694052957282
europe will press ahead with integration ; at the same time the union will start an enlargement process which will , in the end , UNK our continent .    3.0421570131380955
a demanding , ambitious , perhaps even UNK task and we wish you every success , mr president of the commission .    2.3241275501561405
however , we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present .    3.4438399496547007
i say that in all UNK and i have chosen my words carefully .    3.208712493864792
i refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the european union .    3.436505907178428
we in the european union are one community .    3.4520026428355663
we belong together , even when there are problems .    2.9413277771659847
now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying europe .    2.6608707020804436
mr president of the commission , you have represented and defended the european parliament time and again over recent weeks .    3.0634335804081054
you have seen yourself as the guardian of the treaties , and that is indeed your role .    2.9179811268208042
for that and for the letter to the federal chancellor of the republic of austria which you mentioned , we expressly respect , acknowledge and support you .    2.6025594130419814
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
mr president of the commission , our objectives are one and the same : we want a strong europe in the twenty - first century , a democratic europe which is able to act .    2.7532806075819005
a europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and , at the same time , looks after its global interests with dignity , patience and convincing self - confidence .    2.442076395422397
europe ' s message , the european union ' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even european nationalism , no ; it must be one of cooperation , partnership and peaceful development .    3.3675983678823465
globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world , which is becoming smaller and smaller , as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity .    3.295429804521997
seen in this light , globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger , more of a coming together than a UNK , more mutual enrichment than separation .    2.42481840690175
but we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as europeans .    2.897210169745447
globalisation is not only an economic process , it is also a cultural process , which is why we say : we want partnership in the world , we do not want the clash of UNK which many are UNK , we want partnership , a meeting , exchange and peace .    3.567400687647196
but we also say : we want to defend this european community of tolerance , which is why a common foreign , security and defence policy is so important .    3.27776801903968
negotiations with six central european countries are starting today , bringing the european family a step closer together .    2.173935626533965
we agree with what you said about the barcelona process .    2.742725729353293
all the countries in the mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity , democracy and the rule of law .    2.7616256463870728
for us , the group of the european people ' s party and the european democrats , it is not only the reform of the institutions of the european union which will be important in the next five years ; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single european currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the european currency in coming years .    3.5138413128282218
we therefore take the UNK view that we must maintain a UNK and consistent stability pact .    3.0934359346360205
we need structural reforms in the european economy .    3.6850613079284895
most importantly , we need to restore a european economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs .    2.528785791576869
it would be europe ' s UNK if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium - sized businesses in europe .    3.000413393760813
( applause ) the commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays .    2.395006803374154
we too want to help put europe on its feet .    2.931215062463971
you spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity .    2.4083175558486487
we support that .    2.96015328081085
the nations , regions , towns and communities of europe will be preserved .    2.648869671623013
however , there is a current trend - the " fauna , flora , habitat " directive was quoted as an example - which , in my country at least , creates the impression that associations are UNK national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to brussels and that brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural UNK in the countries of the european union .    2.4936580120610357
i merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where i would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future .    2.659929491827072
mr president of the commission , allow me to close with these words : as the group of the european people ' s party and the european democrats , we have every interest in a strong commission .    2.9956411178025433
if you are persuasive in your actions , we all reap the benefits .    2.5983979820658383
in this respect we wish you every success . however , we are also aware of our role as the commission ' s UNK .    3.8031529224471323
if we have the UNK suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the european union , and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case - , but if european law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement UNK , precisely because peace in the european union is founded on this law .    3.180541147031446
we must preserve this law and peace in the european union if we are to be able to go forth as UNK in the world .    3.7875481717159896
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
madam president , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i would like to welcome the presentation of , and the first ever debate on , the commission ' s programme for government - the word president prodi is so fond of ; as i am - for the whole legislature .    3.025976185800041
firstly , this is welcome because it explains , to our fellow citizens , what we are intending to do and what we are already doing . we must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future .    3.3016228612046037
we have taken almost eleven months - president prodi was nominated at the berlin summit in march last year - to establish a legislative programme . this is not entirely president prodi ' s fault .    2.670334883017129
we are recovering from a crisis . however , i believe that , in the future , it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next commission to UNK with the presentation of a legislative programme .    3.8427013396096816
we are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances .    2.180060281183678
president prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation , a paradox in the european union and also throughout the world : we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium , dominated by the web of the internet and the UNK of UNK advance , and we are living through a genuine change of UNK .    2.96522772334021
however , to focus on the european union as it is today , and on the subject of government and governance - a word which , at least in spanish , brings to mind the previous name of the ministry of internal affairs , although it may be an appropriate word anyway - , the most important thing is that the european union be provided with a good government , and , since president prodi always defends his home town , UNK , i would advise him to go to UNK for a while and see something which we all understand : the UNK of UNK UNK , which speak of UNK governo [ good government ] and UNK governo [ bad government ] .    3.402638632381774
what we need here is good government , madam president .    2.682364353856763
since we are recovering from a very complex crisis , we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance .    2.561409993351221
i would like to remind the house of something which we often forget , and that is that the investiture of the prodi commission , last september , received wide support . in our opinion , this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of europe .    3.080349599190188
i would like to point out that , within this broad consensus , there were some groups which said that the majority of parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the council .    2.772849998207232
it is precisely this which , in a sense , is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme .    2.7510447559794398
i am pointing this out because i believe that our support for the commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature .    3.224491571990542
on the other hand , we are witnessing the birth of a political europe , which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon , and a european union at the service of the citizens .    3.1163857336277605
with regard to the events of recent days , i would like to say - and i am saying this on the day , and the week , that the intergovernmental conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which , given what we have said about the austrian crisis , i believe should be fully included in the treaties .    3.6058316132252055
i have absolutely no doubt about this and i believe it is an essential point .    3.969689355338827
in this regard , madam president , i would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language .    2.808739675703933
last week , the new minister for finance of the austrian coalition described the austrian parliament as a farce and a theatre .    2.6604196582749142
those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments .    2.404947141520151
there can be no democracy without a living parliament .    2.3165775406715934
i believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and i would like to condemn it here and now .    3.059895975074888
with regard to the four great priorities which president prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us , i would say that we are very much in agreement .    3.4305211803765596
nevertheless , i would point out to the commission that , as far as the socialist group is concerned , there has been a change of priorities .    4.228069988647521
we understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda , which also includes what is known as ' quality of life ' priorities , that is to say , the rights of citizens as consumers and as people , in relation to those questions which we always talk about , but never give sufficient priority to , that is , the european social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances , consumer rights , respect for the environment and sustainable development .    2.9906271316712263
when speaking of the commitment to full employment , we have to bear in mind that , these days , full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of UNK at the end of the second world war , that is to say , employment for the male head of the household .    2.835760556548693
we must argue for equality of the sexes , the famous ' gender mainstreaming ' , which is one of the least developed questions in the prodi commission ' s programme .    3.0122798830651822
this means prioritising sex equality , the adaptation of the social model and , above all , an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat .    2.504564591898847
this must also be a main priority in the work of the commission . it must be complemented with a UNK fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise , in practice , the evolution of a union which has become a UNK for the rest of the world and an immigration zone , given its prosperity and seasonal UNK .    3.2381962148502015
i believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue .    3.4110921811982506
in this respect i would also add another element , which is economic government , given the single currency , and i believe this is UNK . this is another question on which the commission must make progress .    4.032008485232424
with regard to the ambitious objectives and , above all , the commission ' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration , i would like - and my group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of agenda 2000 .    3.0596853793941032
does the commission think that there will be never be any revision ?    2.9329312157211898
the issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential .    3.0130016278617755
with regard to governance in general , i believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms .    3.07681947926308
i would like to remind you of one thing : it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the european union from here .    2.663333332283433
i would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity .    3.320765174206046
if we are capable of defining what our area of governance is , i think that would be very positive .    3.3041167465201426
in all other areas , i believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion .    3.0020972817924267
not only should the commission discuss this , but also our states , our parliaments and our civil society .    2.6937104511572696
madam president , i would like to refer briefly to the last objective , which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental : the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the europe ' s role in the world .    2.6927760977459463
it appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the UNK of south - east europe , with regard to enlargement and - as i have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the euro - mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts , as well as an issue which we seldom talk about ; the north - south challenge .    3.465312883525612
we must not forget africa , a continent which has been UNK , not only by god , but also by europe , nor our important contribution to cooperating with development .    2.905385409799905
lastly , an issue for which we are increasingly responsible , as the world ' s foremost economic and commercial power , that is , europe ' s voice in the world , which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the millennium round .    3.503377760178673
it means the reform of the united nations and the international financial institutions , for which europe has an enormous responsibility .    3.3496925775062376
above all , madam president - and here i will end - we must be able to express this in plain language , clearly , by changing to some extent the jargon which we use , because we cannot ask the europeans , who are living through profound changes , to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely UNK .    2.7468089146436414
this is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us . i hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next european elections .    2.5086703341715753
mr president of the commission , may i say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure , the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this house today : that is that the UNK now are UNK political .    3.2135121570633576
they are political because we are moving on .    3.029507545098249
even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks , we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of europe to a much more challenging political perspective .    2.653436480270957
the challenge of enlargement is political .    2.9018615023276637
the challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs , of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime , is very political .    2.6822305087108846
the challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political .    2.837676736735053
because it is political it is more complex .    3.0695921634036254
because it is political it is more sovereignty - sensitive .    2.679064594716579
because it is more sovereignty - sensitive it is more UNK - and citizen - sensitive .    2.977294377764028
we need , therefore , to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives , to address , not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy , the apathy which you identify .    2.449329743184295
the means of achieving this are difficult but they are real .    2.951961441916053
i applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions , not just between commission and parliament , but also between these and the council to UNK the extent of the political challenge .    4.101011750654915
we need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil society .    3.027366280628628
we need more explanation of what europe is about .    2.59748443977592
we need to be able to confront fears and anxieties , because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself .    2.3448947961335227
perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that .    2.316992980257671
my group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a white paper next spring addressing the issue of governance .    2.71653945396684
as we look at the europe of networking which you describe , it is very important that europe concentrates on its core business , that we have the courage to suggest areas where europe may perhaps stand back .    3.0445647803862887
that could convince people that europe , in its governance , is not something run exclusively from brussels , which concentrates and UNK up more powers , more decisions , more authority .    2.448286208086265
that is the political core of the challenge and i think you have identified it well before this house today .    2.8686303288993837
for my group , enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured , be they governance , be they the intergovernmental conference , be they reform of the institutions .    3.0930107777470246
we see enlargement as a process of partnership , not a process of " them and us " .    2.794767900353907
we see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states .    2.1326383719415403
i suggest to the commission , as a UNK of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement , to present a document , that explains the value of enlargement , not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense ; a document , like the UNK report before the single act , that explains to people in a way which UNK them in the debate that this is the grand , historic challenge facing europe today .    3.3976581096354805
we need to be able to prepare that ground carefully .    2.7968323573062945
on south - eastern europe , i agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements .    2.7124808554859317
in the UNK of this commission and this parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south - eastern europe .    2.864097715416289
we applaud the stabilisation and association agreements , but we would like to see more .    3.5409271280964054
we will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the swoboda report later this week .    2.770414413206132
the strategic paper emphasises the global role of the european union .    2.565646970432517
our central aim must be to give the union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid , trade and finance .    2.6788098109337826
at the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end , and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies , where we fit into un agencies and so on .    1.9601250413733233
in conclusion , this morning , the day after st valentine ' s day , the newspapers are saying that your UNK period is over .    2.4132533257433746
i do not know whether you are a UNK or not , mr prodi .    3.2098309697815512
however , we in the liberal group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business .    2.679819178193202
that is the way it should be .    3.8206839665751633
regarding the many UNK descriptions of europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic europe , an enterprising europe , a europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me , in a word dear to the heart of my liberal colleagues , give in one UNK , one description of the kind of europe we want to see in your plan for governance : an enabling europe .    2.3633086476924454
madam president , mr president of the commission , i greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the european union must change fundamentally .    2.6993681540668306
you gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme .    2.6126853841192297
i believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day - to - day ones .    2.4558697167442145
at the same time , however , it has to be said that , unfortunately , your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto .    3.1487728101066117
there are a lot of good intentions in it , but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved .    2.9321343140739775
i would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them .    2.3449114621730587
first let me speak about the economy and social development .    2.999624680565546
we have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment ; that is what was mentioned in your programme .    3.16401902067459
should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria , in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no member state should be higher than , say , the three most successful countries in this matter ?    2.523990298330098
ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of , because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure . but , unfortunately , as we all know , this is an area where the european union is totally unable to act .    3.349492502602547
do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference .    2.422713677642012
the eu can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone .    2.5004390200443365
in this respect , parliament will definitely defend , along with yourselves , the importance of supranational decision - making .    2.7067846396257234
i think it is very UNK that you should mention the concept of ' global administration ' , as others too have said here .    2.7836945247262332
however , please learn from the events of seattle : we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade , on the one hand , with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend , on the other .    3.4726443142176175
you must embark on a dialogue with the international community .    2.897084320094042
do please try to make the international organisations democratic .    2.9805982011787115
the european union could be critically important in a process in which the united nations and the wto really do become subject to democratic monitoring .    2.9938638643122917
we can submit motions for this together with you .    2.348110127886332
finally , i consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society , although , unfortunately , this is another contradiction .    2.959441529246645
you ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the igc .    3.0987231648255222
we have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision - making .    2.458853253940169
what you just said is absolutely true : people want more engaged democracy .    2.1867305262530774
in my opinion , this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to europe and their interest in europe too .    3.572713404119926
madam president , my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the commission ' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate , instead of being reduced to an on - the - spot reaction in plenary .    2.918721398943745
the main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists .    3.203117218715388
we are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which mr prodi has just underlined and , in some cases , usefully clarified .    2.6632763144332916
clearly , many citizens are ' UNK and anxious ' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems , such as unemployment and social exclusion , which affect our very existence . this must be one of our absolute priorities .    2.658166701510409
we do need to rethink many aspects of current community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success . we also need ' distinctive strategic partnerships ' with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace .    2.711241813851863
there are plenty of areas for serious discussion .    2.3896322019120584
we will carefully study the planned white papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised .    2.204427964307978
it is in this spirit that i have three criticisms to make . these must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new europe , as proclaimed UNK by the title of the commission document and mr prodi ' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric .    3.1081366691203467
the first and most serious criticism concerns the commission ' s UNK for rather UNK self - satisfaction with regard to the european union and for a UNK and even UNK view of our partners .    3.563085959666509
the perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the commission communication .    2.8954500961625347
this talks of the european union as ' living proof that peace , stability , freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent ' and as a model showing the world the way forward . it concludes that ' our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity , and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so ' .    2.6242379420460433
a more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view .    2.528999933851976
similarly , the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the european central bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding .    2.673683643918555
my second criticism follows on from the first .    2.8339589064816986
this extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and , where necessary , confronting these is seriously limiting the will , duly confirmed by mr prodi , to grant public demands .    2.4139021330705615
for example , at least in the countries which i know well , i doubt that the intention , repeated three or four times in the commission document , to reform ' europe ' s social protection , health care and pension systems UNK a climate of more cautious public spending ' will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back .    2.7473360503625703
my third criticism stems from the first two . the weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an UNK of generalisations , a rather UNK approach and therefore a lack of impetus .    2.38358697286151
but all is not lost .    2.690787608763184
this is a starting point and we have five years to succeed , provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity .    2.746191675609286
my group is fully intent on helping with this work .    2.316876646402401
madam president , reforming and UNK the institutions of the european union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process .    2.855750728157016
this was the opening statement of commission president , prodi , when he presented the strategic objectives of the european commission for the next five years .    3.2525595015454765
we await the white paper on the governance of the european union dealing with the issue of balance between member states ' governments and the european union institutions which is to be published this summer .    4.086521441430006
on this specific point i think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision - making procedures of the commission .    3.5823398217906095
the commission , in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller member states lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the european commission .    2.6698669104420754
this is a scenario whereby the european union has a membership of over 25 member states .    2.743679761700674
i do not want to see a two - UNK european union built .    2.872498643341471
i believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the treaty of rome and all subsequent treaties .    2.7688340235674103
there must be equality in terms of national representation within the commission and within all the other european institutions .    3.3185074956522014
i would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small member states to nominate a european commissioner that the united states of america gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the united states senate .    2.7438554514371387
more or less each of the 50 states in the us has two elected positions in the united states senate , regardless of its population .    3.081867483866967
any future reforms of the european union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country .    3.519588281847934
it would be very difficult for those who propose a ' yes ' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the irish people if we lose our right to have our UNK to the european commission .    2.5524451675980058
undoubtedly , reform of the european council is also going to be included in this white paper on the governance of the european union which will be published this summer .    3.957486176355377
once again there are special areas of policy - making which should be left to the domain of the national member states .    2.801794841237625
i do not believe that there is broad support in europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation , justice and home affairs , and foreign affairs at european union level .    2.5743476415952142
at present , under article 99 of the treaty of rome , decisions taken at eu level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity .    2.359268737394032
i believe that this proposal should remain , as a common european taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the european union .    2.522003898266118
however , we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the european union is a vital factor in changing the eu treaties .    3.0152436485653347
changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping , otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future european union treaty very difficult indeed .    2.241488283253057
madam president , i am speaking on behalf of the italian radical members .    2.6290695598490537
president of the commission , a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five - year plans .    2.972843878201053
this is true , if we think of russia ' s plans in the thirties , but at the start of your mandate , a few months ago , you yourself announced at the conference of presidents that you would , however , be presenting a legislative programme , or rather , the major policy lines of the european government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today .    3.2198756421095474
so , whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme , the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions , or rather a list of issues on the table . it does not , however , give us the impression that the commission is taking a clear position on any of these points , but that it is just doing the european commission ' s duty .    3.659324478363905
in this house , in the past , large - scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the commission , under its power of initiative , launched , not as experiments , but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress , but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the european union .    3.077984302765094
in this case , mr prodi , we certainly have a kind of " ten UNK " : a whole raft of issues are listed , but if i may say so , we are left with the impression that the commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points .    3.0618552054319657
there was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease " unnecessary " activities .    2.4569269620661736
we should be careful , though , mr prodi , because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous commission and backed this commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this commission - precisely because , first and foremost , the reform of the commission would bring consolidation , a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand .    2.8781950625659154
let us consider the scenario whereby the commission , not believing itself to be equal to the task , wishes , or proposes to shed , for example , its powers to implement common policies , which it is nevertheless accorded by the treaty .    2.921953616373185
what do we expect from a government in any case ?    3.0251519715311317
what do we ask of this structure - the european community - which is , so to speak , ambiguous and unique ?    2.9090068694667552
it is right for joint resources to be controlled UNK and not to be delegated to the member states or the taos , as has been the case in the past .    3.3229469346446776
it seems that you are proposing the same old UNK , but with more unsatisfactory implications , restricting the commission , so you say , to the task of drawing up a few white papers , as you proposed .    3.406167859861283
my fear - even if you shake your head , mr prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years , that the commission should be a simple secretariat for the council of ministers .    3.104349357466795
if this is the role that the commission intends to play over the next five years , we federalists are convinced , we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the commission intends to do in this regard .    3.569608411721945
the reform is important but , if it aggravates the situation , reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the commission , then the structure of european integration , as planned by the founding fathers for the european commission , will be at risk .    3.293418330907368
   3.702094057753363
as for the other points , mr prodi , i will take economic and social policy as an example : the european social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not UNK that unemployment UNK the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve , but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past , without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective .    3.2555502857586065
if we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far , i do not know what we or the commission will be able to do .    3.12704261195453
the same goes for enlargement as an end in itself , without it being linked to a reform to make the european union and its structures much more efficient , and to proposals that the commission could have made at the igc .    3.129272666906327
mr prodi , there is one positive thing that i would like to say to you , perhaps contrary to the opinion of some members , regarding the telegram that you sent to the austrian government .    3.526151987857764
we approve of your position on this : you did well not to isolate that country any further .    2.4473559978170645
in any case , we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action .    2.5565655315071965
mr prodi , i repeat that this is , in our opinion , a slightly short - sighted view .    3.8700969653351405
above all , it lacks drive in the sectors i have mentioned , for example , as regards the balkans .    3.275389377305039
can we really continue to leave the balkans out of the enlargement process , disregarding the fact that croatia , macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this house that is open to all ?    3.2361489569960864
madam president , mr prodi , i should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the union ' s activities and ask why , then , you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation .    3.2617658707788837
i remember your predecessor ' s speech five years ago .    2.6340388948595055
like yourself , he promised " less and better " , but mr santer finished up by having delivered " much more and much worse " , and i do not believe that you , either , can deliver the goods you promise .    2.310928971220137
you talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation .    2.367466630080318
the legislative programme is , in fact , a UNK of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which , mr prodi , you are to take influence away from the people , even on social questions .    3.5121508236244523
you talk about greater transparency , but produce proposals which would lead to documents which , at present , are available for public inspection being locked away .    2.5951357109367317
your commission consists of the only 20 people in the eu who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced .    2.759908237450501
local politicians cannot do that , once legislation has been passed in brussels .    2.729616071171349
the legislative programme from the commission ought at least , therefore , to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the member states and to the processes of popular democracy . otherwise , the number of laws produced in brussels will just keep on growing .    3.4431479366874007
we have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments , and the applicant states have had 26 000 documents sent to them which , as debated by the polish parliament , fill 140 000 sides of paper .    2.4233547814371574
even by this stage , that is already too many by far .    3.3010150743392304
brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people , the regions and the member states . the only decisions which should remain with brussels are those concerning cross - border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively .    2.787458944164112
what is more , the work carried out in brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent , so that people might at least have some small sense of UNK the process , now that mr prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them .    2.615754230563354
i should also just like to draw mr UNK ' UNK ' s attention to what the founding fathers of the european union dreamed of . take a look at jean UNK ' s UNK .    3.3042115942488204
what he envisaged was what he called a small , practical secretariat .    2.295071007511499
that is not what mr prodi is president of today .    2.4661618572077666
madam president , this morning the commission president , mr prodi , has set out ambitious goals for the european union for the next five years , laudable aims indeed , to make a strong and effective european presence felt in the world : UNK with enlargement , meeting the challenge of selling e - europe , introducing better principles of governance .    2.8066643834616047
we accept that europeans , particularly the UNK generation , need to be given a broad perspective of where europe will be in the years ahead .    3.020652275159845
but how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high ?    2.5246767660092253
we need to match this vision with reality .    2.403092175813055
here there are three elements i would like to contribute .    3.383707489795816
firstly , we need a successful european economy .    3.187153931714522
we must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across europe , confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation , encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the internet , show that e - europe is a good initiative .    2.4820139729046917
but we must avoid UNK back into the old - style regulation , stifling individual initiative and enterprise .    2.2667365474131485
without a successful european economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead , particularly of enlargement .    2.4908956591449627
secondly , we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity .    2.831700751714419
we will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation .    2.6000568923172858
mr bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations , which seems to go in a different direction .    2.79860258531105
we must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes .    2.5836972060527468
lastly , we need to ensure that there is proper , genuine reform of the european commission .    3.6886907533954534
yes , the commission - guardian of the treaties - is meant to be an independent body , but it also has to be accountable to european citizens through our parliament .    3.7311626223038354
the information problem , which mr bonde just referred to , is treated like a straw in the wind , with the commission UNK to restrict information to us , as citizens and as parliamentarians , although we have the right to it under the treaties .    2.819374962240748
the commission is not in fact today a european government .    2.7588443276865964
the commission does not reflect the majority in this particular parliament .    2.9408050825153444
we in parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in europe .    2.7526207614384934
this governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the european union , has its relevant role to play .    3.430312919395217
therefore we need to have credibility , coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the european union to our citizens .    2.989999342763354
madam president , mr president of the commission , numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the european union , from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy ; even to the response by the 14 , the commission and parliament to the new coalition in austria .    3.3565611166561546
i fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions .    2.643451826327388
nonetheless , i agree with you , mr president of the commission , that many more steps to strengthen the european union will be needed in the future because the european union is not strong enough either to master the huge , inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which , to put it UNK , have an ambivalent attitude towards european values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent .    2.958662058937145
that does not apply to austria alone .    2.8796209258404475
the union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the treaty of amsterdam and the institutions of the eu confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in austria .    2.459326811758465
however , the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the treaty and , in the final analysis , represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens .    2.9826399614126298
when it comes down to it , articles 6 and 7 of the treaty are not enough .    2.9752967284991483
in this sense , the commission must insist , and i should like to endorse and confirm this here , that the new charter of fundamental rights become part of the treaty and create binding , enforceable rights .    3.5940607630385037
in this sense , the commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom , security and justice and in this sense i disagree with the last two speakers .    2.8583784503885807
only reasonable , feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational , misleading and UNK allegations of the extreme right .    1.9297222988810498
but , and i would like to stress this , this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment , marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti - european , nationalistic actions and reactions .    2.55547041945578
in this respect , mr president of the commission , i too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large UNK of the population .    3.4059962346908144
the feeling of being at the mercy of others , of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote , as in the european elections and , in the worst case scenario , to extremist voting UNK .    2.8110477248687102
the union , like everyone else , has not yet understood how to present the eu to the citizens of the eu as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation .    3.289353763919766
we are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house .    2.5265771418687346
what we need are not just reforms of the world trade organisation and the economic architecture - and , significantly , the president of the commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture ; we also need confidence - building measures for our citizens , who rightly expect help and support from and in the eu with the inevitable and UNK process of adapting to new global circumstances .    2.8788555205469097
in this respect , what the commission says about boosting europe ' s voice is important .    2.793311026509201
you yourself , mr president , spoke of a model of which , unfortunately , there is little mention in the document . you said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic , social , cultural and ecological development , both internally and towards the outside world , which differs from other models , including the us model .    3.225471304178947
in this sense , the usa is not only our partner ; it is also our competitor ; not our UNK , our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model .    2.552331592225182
i hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the commission documents .    3.168249890741802
madam president , mr president of the commission , the greatest legacy which your commission could pass on to the european union would be to help UNK and redistribute the increasingly UNK and confused powers and competences of the commission , and perhaps of the union itself .    3.0505438214153324
you have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so - called " core tasks " .    2.9689778133774567
that , as you have said yourself today , means that you must also identify tasks , policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the commission ' s main UNK .    2.965533998430571
many existing european union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell - by date , or have been proved UNK or ineffective when administered at european level .    2.045871595370136
the challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non - core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national , regional and local government .    2.449884425983139
if we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical european public of the merits of further european integration , we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted eu powers as we are in the evolution of new eu powers .    2.7918539905793223
we must not allow the critics of european integration to claim , as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from mr bonde , that the increase in eu responsibilities is a one - way street only .    2.741386772045035
it must be shown to be a two - way process in which existing eu policies and programmes , which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality , are UNK and repealed .    3.0915016267532955
if you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead , you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the european union as a whole and , as we have heard today , you will enjoy widespread support in this european parliament .    3.5309513357911593
madam president , you spoke about fundamental political values , and one of the fundamental political values , even more important than democracy , is respect for others .    2.8055828813930517
we therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of UNK or nazism . democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong , but also listening to their explanations .    2.1323353994850063
we therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be UNK with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in romania , reaching as far as belgrade , but above all , the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues .    2.825519871288822
even today , we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power UNK in the eastern republics .    3.232101099349019
we therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement , so that we can at last establish a european monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions , with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur .    2.7185963082272715
i would also like to say a few words on africa , madam president .    2.3341924651941035
the third and fourth worlds have been abandoned : just one dollar , one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children .    2.2923754365773754
europe , which is so democratic , so progressive , does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board , while half of africa is dying of aids and other diseases .    2.3667146427295975
one final remark regarding the internet and globalisation .    2.725203998192817
globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification , just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean UNK of values or UNK of hopes and enthusiasm .    2.5220157611407803
the peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an UNK that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few .    2.2592368690266853
as for the internet , europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules .    3.5287092979997654
on a personal note , please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who , by acting the way they are , are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently UNK .    2.73502138491255
we live in a world of rules and regulations : let us regulate the internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future .    2.4475993840011574
madam president , as a padanian taxpayer , i have already experienced the vice - like grip of the UNK and former prime minister of italy , mr prodi , since UNK is liable to italy for its taxes as well .    2.7057529150989095
listening to him just now , i was concerned when he mentioned new resources , something that readily translates as additional taxation , in view , inter alia , of enlargement , that is the entry of new states into the union .    2.740292338364855
but why do they not buy their own entrance ticket ?    2.2738697296737502
my padanian electorate who , thanks to mr prodi , have already paid what in italy is known as the european tax - UNK only in part - have absolutely no intention , thanks once again to mr prodi , of paying another tax for someone else .    2.603066360876858
madam president , mr president of the commission , members of the commission , five months after its coming into office , the commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the european union .    2.9855660142723233
the ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic .    2.3325324226628257
is it not rather UNK to say that " the world looks up to europe " ?    2.869713816560827
moreover , europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen eu member states .    2.8967479426275826
it is not rather ambitious to ensure peace , democracy and human rights in the whole of europe , no less ?    3.28056892898983
i am particularly UNK by how the commission considers bringing this about .    2.717925279581372
does " the european integration model as a rich source for global administration " imply the export of a large - scale perspective and concentration of power ?    2.2484694150560287
according to the commission , external policy can succeed , provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge !    2.83535751129547
so who is this then ?    2.71783176426043
the commission as a whole , its president perhaps , the council ?    3.270456570323049
you stated that the new european government requires strong institutions , while the commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks .    3.045944985831486
we could not agree more with the latter .    2.576868966674457
it is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross - border issues and stopped UNK out the european cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities .    2.1280877039040655
the document mentions common values on different occasions .    2.427382597435791
unfortunately , i find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking .    2.949838805579271
this raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on .    2.722395105289276
i am convinced that the UNK , god ' s word , is the only pure source of proper standards and real values .    2.8319174388465145
in the tradition of our continent , this realisation is an important one which merits recognition .    2.484968023810963
madam president , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , i am not sure which to go by : the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010 ?    2.4619691018960923
have you already included your second term of office ?    2.54418802393769
but seriously .    3.1074046683915344
as it UNK , the union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and UNK .    3.750690578655842
first , streamlining .    2.8258824473184867
what you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the commission is only the beginning .    3.3903643060331636
the activities of the entire union must be reduced to core areas of policy .    2.9508943510121064
in other words , a social , ecologically - orientated market , a secure currency , guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally .    2.0413729945396772
it is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice ; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important .    4.3624162273995495
secondly , the new " in " word is flexibility .    2.5920220850650466
however , increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into UNK .    2.1243253044427792
we must hold fast to joint decision - making institutions which embrace the member states .    2.415873969262215
that also applies to the inclusion of the civil society , which is a welcome step .    3.5587944329785524
our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers .    2.3501957613240383
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
transparency does not mean more access to more paper ; to our citizens , transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , when and with what right .    2.6003149884546954
that is transparency .    2.799653546533199
thirdly , the european union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly .    3.065719277165125
its borders are set not by how may countries want to join , but by how many countries it can accommodate .    2.3454641973190453
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
if the price of enlargement is the watering - down or even the break - up of the present union , then it must not be paid .    3.185309548371845
it is too high a price , not only for the member states already in the union but also for the states which want to join the union .    3.570178714781358
there is no future for a union which is merely a UNK - strategic concept or for a union which is merely a free trade zone .    2.6422468915609976
but the union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of europe if it sees itself as a community of UNK .    3.309462460854688
that goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new , better quality of life .    2.590873576362685
in doing so , we need , no less , to reinvent the european union , but without destroying the present union .    3.3480624262014134
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
the commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the union as soon as possible .    2.2795842363414907
on the other hand , we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down .    2.49698222707531
to avoid this the european liberal democrats have expressed the hope that the intergovernmental conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric union , in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring .    2.856248008600866
it is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the union will be raised at the igc .    3.395223500227103
the subject needs to be discussed without prejudice .    3.3149522990514013
a technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough : we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by jacques delors , for example .    3.1838189758436664
in this way , a decision - making system can be created that is more effective , clearer , more open and more democratic .    2.5423543135939513
i hope that the commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding union might implement its institutional and other differentiation .    2.215522021243969
madam president , mr president of the commission , commissioners , your inspiring speech , mr prodi , has quite won me over .    2.4361439317122358
this is connected to what mr van velzen was just saying , about the difference between words and deeds .    2.462014769402565
the enlargement of the union is inspired by our wish for peace , security and stability .    3.1410043280563427
you are looking to reassure the acceding countries , as well as european opinion .    2.7293124877331776
but these days , we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes .    2.803867058884239
we have noted increasing levels of UNK and UNK , even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high .    2.7287080842984226
we need to make our citizens feel at home , according to mr swoboda , and i agree .    3.7603381039266686
this is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility .    2.435867395174714
this is probably linked to the standards mentioned by mr van dam , namely subsidiarity .    2.715588504264342
it is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners , rather than competitors when it comes to policy .    2.94561051396294
it is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens , where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves .    2.7829883470231778
that will require a new political culture , not only in words , but also in practice , which will take into consideration the reality of member states and regions .    3.910240243681441
regions which , culturally and economically , sometimes match the interest of some member states .    2.4561009266963616
the new europe should not only expand UNK , but also UNK , by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community .    2.8937183255051018
this is what the commission will be judged on .    3.6458281925397498
madam president , the commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000 - 2005 . these are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been UNK over to prevent any conflict .    2.825482070979282
so , in the first part on the new forms of european governance , the words ' federalism ' and ' superstate ' are not mentioned at all .    2.9084092724899473
yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong european institutions in which only day - to - day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an UNK whole . in this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society , all of which are described , with no form of hierarchy , as ' integral elements of european governance ' .    2.4208555355388746
these ambiguities UNK many misunderstandings , primarily about our values .    2.176356881316252
it is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat .    3.2420685155530657
it must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate , fair and transparent democratic debate , namely at national level in the main .    2.4749155568073427
yet the whole of the commission communication is based on the opposite theory . in this theory , on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples , their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations , new policies or new , restrictive legal structures such as the draft charter of fundamental rights .    2.6895413123708036
this charter is really UNK because it will actually reduce these rights .    2.6645910345141615
in the union for a europe of nations group our principles are rather different .    2.4427398737740167
clearly we want to defend the countries of europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations .    3.6509958133937466
this is not impossible .    2.8347704141992596
we must move away from the UNK federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on european matters comes from the UNK of jean UNK .    2.6917096802331444
instead , we must open the european institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations .    2.8573044599878776
this is the UNK idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication , mr prodi , but which is unfortunately not there .    3.0055126986348335
madam president , mr prodi , you claim to be shaping a new europe yet you are lacking one basic element : confidence .    2.1152583938962035
the confidence of millions of europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this .    2.6123856830901606
and how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the santer commission for corruption ?    2.249224573470904
you wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders . consequently , you have opened europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration .    2.1702967154279285
you are now proposing to give all decision - making power to a handful of officials . the member states , local authorities and ngos will simply become UNK of decisions handed down from above , all on an equal footing in their submission to brussels .    2.469737510112797
not once does your twelve - page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people .    2.5621634682515415
clearly , they have no role to play in your strategy .    3.0732851795035705
having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty , you are now revealing your ultimate goal . you intend to trade in all european sovereignty , whether national or collective , for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position .    2.464932552169076
finally , you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of austrians , or are allowing this to happen , just because the result does not suit you .    2.2125070366722266
yet at the same time you are supporting communist china and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades .    2.456811337567767
members of this house are today speaking out against a telegram from mr prodi to chancellor schüssel which , quite obviously , is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre .    2.457520711841463
your UNK - UNK UNK no one because , as you know perfectly well , whether you like it or not , you need austria in order to reform the treaties and harmonise savings tax .    3.0694566929679103
you will UNK and hypocritically use austria as a convenient threat to further strip the member states of any real powers in the construction of the european union .    2.4475244966467176
your commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this .    2.7625771751490302
the governments which , through spinelessness or ideology , support you are also responsible .    2.362382332788383
brussels is not all of us , as you claim . it is all of you .    4.2568744563878225
tell the truth for once . you could not care less what the people of europe want .    2.502325932349993
they are free to choose only between your brave new world and UNK .    2.335908520682689
it is over ten years since the collapse of the soviet union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the UNK and UNK UNK .    2.5050623020290845
we were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship .    2.171000889052815
we are and will remain among those fighting against europeanist dictatorship . we call on all the people of europe to resist your UNK projects .    2.6318241838979946
the salvation of european democracies is with nation states . europe ' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of europe .    2.5428975474769633
president prodi , today you have presented the commission ' s five - year programme , and it has many objectives that we endorse .    3.498677904485446
it is a programme based on real - life situations and issues , and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues .    2.974376385740512
in my view , mr prodi , judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us , one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance , and that is solidarity , not so much at international level as at internal level .    2.7696331277852018
the UNK of milan , UNK UNK maria UNK , is calling upon all politicians , in particular those like you and me , president prodi , for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of catholics in politics , to reconsider a development process , which , in addition to economic profit , takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account .    2.411722651210195
it is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up , one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone .    2.808035114372423
it also reminds us of the need for a new growth model , one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the catholics who are involved in social problems , who see , in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public , the most natural instruments for building solidarity .    2.845273525604353
the fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom , which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced .    2.4120191281423526
this social freedom , which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor , gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability .    2.3538052700306764
mr president , public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion .    2.372491762089471
they must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual , without forgetting , naturally , that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business , to invest and risk , and in an ordered and focused system , entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity .    2.647718339236442
our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart .    2.775257784984409
we hope that the white paper and the actions of you and your commission will put this into practice .    2.864570294754442
madam president , mr president of the commission , ' shaping the new europe ' is an ambitious objective both for the commission and for us all .    2.8989107338552667
our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries , but also by many people outside europe and the european union .    3.1105681031863393
what sort of impression will an interested public , as well as the rest of the world , have of this five - year programme ?    2.8202438957618976
my reply would be : a new start , a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the union in the UNK will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously .    2.801547082430805
the commission is correct in stating that the union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation .    2.746291514552111
it foresees a just and more effective europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self - interest .    2.1537413362488143
consequently , we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom .    2.4601002300137003
i concur with what other members of my political group have said and i commend the tone of your document . however , there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work .    2.803500347897832
the first concerns women , gender and women ' s rights .    2.6117003854675844
you talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth .    2.3046917810496437
that is important , but equality is not only necessary for productivity , but also to make our societies more democratic .    2.9295885672081856
it is therefore noticeable that ' equality ' , ' gender ' and ' women ' are barely mentioned in ' shaping the new europe ' .    1.996637303898412
you mentioned ' women ' in your speech , but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals .    3.156134729827414
is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the commission that there is no need to mention women ?    3.1496728369001232
what other explanation could there be for UNK women ?    2.311846075557646
the eu must not take on a masculine persona .    2.6113627051586725
my other question concerns africa , which is the only continent not mentioned in ' shaping the new europe ' .    2.712335183386645
africa has the largest number of refugees in the world , the most overall poverty and a UNK aids epidemic .    2.7190319545936776
i know that commissioner nielson and some of the other commissioners are doing a fine job , but the rest of the commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent , partly by including it among its strategic goals .    2.91707767385869
finally , i welcome the commission ' s statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the eu is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets .    3.1150012634292716
i would merely ask when this is likely to take effect .    2.5340287785456272
madam president , president of the commission , this is a vital document for the future and fate of europe .    3.4663416146284587
however , out of all the points , two specifically require our attention , and they are closely linked : peace and stability within europe and outside europe .    2.6561858444543534
it is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority .    2.857979141516265
for some time , we have all agreed on this notion , but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement , even if this comes at a price .    3.2738832081554388
today , we have been called on to choose , for the forthcoming decades , between a europe that might be less prosperous but a UNK of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a europe that might be more wealthy , but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring .    2.8506484378916133
these goals will be more easily UNK only if the intergovernmental conference , which will draw to a close within the year , results in constitutional reform , providing the commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement council decisions or parliament ' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real european government .    2.9274793431214277
moreover , it will only be possible to give the commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded .    3.86528321819418
without these prospects that we have outlined , europe would , once again , have no future .    3.060750933579399
madam president , mr prodi , we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which europe must overcome .    3.1501601215084984
this event must underpin enlargement .    2.548495761967746
rather than using the word ' enlargement ' , i want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance .    2.514154191233056
your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks . this is one of the goals of your reform .    2.799571283923204
in essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity .    2.4771779205885447
precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence .    2.4984892096402227
however , saying is one thing and doing is another !    2.5546311562367494
you must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers .    2.4816592746733317
i will therefore judge you on your deeds .    2.413101622807982
in the meantime , i approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication .    2.1935471887661637
however , i must make two essential points . these concern the simplification and application of community law .    2.35686166990188
in 1998 , 123 UNK were made to the court of justice for non - application or non - transposition and 25 % of environmental directives were not applied or transposed .    2.2972557597776038
recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential .    2.726457634244225
community law must not go UNK because it is too complex or too UNK .    3.2495392131004985
the union must not make this mistake and i therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this .    2.791274610739457
you are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us , including unemployment .    2.931161124804533
nevertheless , i regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed .    2.8642934502685025
the emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility .    2.6421709882049313
you have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society , not only economically but also in terms of public health .    2.6536104413147235
this is a silent revolution and in this respect i expected more from your communication .    2.6001241113512243
finally , you do highlight european research as being at the heart of our future .    2.6675941631971383
yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this .    2.8597313007036247
also , ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these .    2.579606934204847
if you want to better inform the people , you should start by strengthening liaison with this house , as we are the representatives of the citizens .    3.24919818594719
madam president , we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five - year programme and of the programme for 2000 , set out with so much enthusiasm by president prodi this morning .    3.077084156270864
in the two documents , strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of european governance and , to this end , to introduce a new agenda for the commission , establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment , through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the states , and , primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation .    3.0750519666795544
firstly , the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors , with the backing of the european investment bank .    3.1782488988174036
i feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature , resulting from investments in continuous training , UNK courses , adaptability and UNK of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives , that are always debatable , regarding new employment or employment cuts .    1.993435464693242
if , among other things , as the programme of the portuguese presidency stresses as well , the commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue , focusing on an agreed strategy of UNK and UNK of knowledge , in other words , a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules , this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and UNK management of the restructuring and UNK processes .    3.187184233345772
thirdly , i do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population , owing to the ageing of the population , is unavoidable and inevitable for the european union . this is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration , but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early UNK from the job market , and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems , certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people ' s increased life UNK and towards a longer working life .    2.7340206504851627
madam president , mr president of the commission , you have come here today , mr prodi , in a very UNK and ambitious mood .    3.4897475489259198
i welcome you and your ambition .    2.726721033596069
ambition will be needed , given the mammoth task which awaits us .    2.605001027101251
in order to make these reforms , however , and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme , we must be very sure , not only of the strengths of the reformer himself , but also of the opinions of others .    3.564857846627742
we have 1 . 27 % of the community ' s gdp .    3.145871648953833
not a euro more or a euro less .    2.4209874327713523
it will not be us who refuse these new resources . you should ask the council .    2.638485623677029
these financial perspectives are UNK to within a UNK .    2.7133276599721583
in order to finance the stability plan for the balkans , we will have to negotiate a significant revision of category 4 , and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget .    3.0021111921392087
i would remind you that this group , the ppe - de , does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones .    2.6703715252412024
the political priorities must be set by this house and the meps .    3.0937108289311883
do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the community financial system .    2.8992938818494296
it is all very well for us , by mutual consensus , to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation , but you must be very aware that the lack of resources , the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget , continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved .    3.2231222619567097
we therefore wonder whether the commission has the political will to resolve them .    3.374296181134951
on one hand , there are the words and , on the other , their real political meaning .    3.458686979623315
we socialists applaud the commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty .    2.87820798624558
yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled ?    2.60301062813862
what is meant by the commission ' s declared objective of ' economic reform ' in the labour market ?    3.2413798073929923
does this mean more flexibility , insecurity and fixed - term contracts ?    2.155645873266898
everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth .    2.4827238176889717
the union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient .    3.00569352953718
we socialists desperately want a european pact for growth and employment .    2.26812615608986
the ingredients of this policy are well known . they are the stimulation of public and private investment , increased investment in research , education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise .    2.7998741806926244
in this respect , the e - europe initiative is to be welcomed .    2.6124757334020687
in the world of new technologies , the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are .    2.974619580796992
the gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era .    2.4627134964736723
on one hand we have the UNK of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and , on the other , more widespread exclusion .    3.585053299353
we are asking workers to be flexible , innovative and ever more productive , yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone .    2.271774474367319
the european central bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets , yet it never UNK an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity .    2.17191062571314
how do we explain to workers who fall victim to the UNK of the worldwide monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the UNK of industry , having lost the UNK of a take - over , leave with compensation of eur 30 million ?    2.6032694913880863
for years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised .    2.809747256698426
the sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions , leading inevitably to monopoly situations .    2.4132561134714794
all these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15 % , 20 % or 25 % which are unrealistic in the long term .    1.9994082441643248
the UNK rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase .    2.6292831015483045
the main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets .    2.527141340614231
to conclude , the next five years will be crucial .    2.8433424033275045
there is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one .    2.832442826329242
i am thinking of transport policy and regional policy .    2.3723222364273457
you have excellent commissioners for both issues in mrs palacio and mr barnier , yet still you attach too little importance to these areas .    2.0455960839723195
and do you know why ?    2.812110732356385
just look at transport policy ; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries .    2.490882979414063
i would be grateful if the president of the commission would listen to what i have to say , although of course he has no obligation to do so .    3.065829259138819
let me give you three examples .    2.5308519353933367
first : we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways .    2.265067397327162
that makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view .    2.7688892424506375
without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy .    2.618299797122377
the same applies to european air traffic control .    2.405326162125932
our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic , but leaving 15 different sectors in the UNK which are under national control , which have an adverse economic impact on the UNK and which pollute the environment .    3.297141773972144
you still have not finished that agenda .    2.6313818204473574
commissioner , far too little is said in your paper about regional policy .    2.5032115248930458
economic and social cohesion in the eu is a fundamental task of this community .    3.9698567582197253
if we fail to complete it , citizens in less favoured regions will UNK enlargement .    2.314841363830131
we must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means .    2.454528804597178
then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it .    2.6848659604419933
mr president of the commission , if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions , then this union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people .    3.1674253630656155
madam president , mr president of the commission , commissioners , the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage .    2.923972170658638
from that standpoint , it is useful that the commission ' s work programme comes back to the issues of agenda 2000 , the common agricultural policy , which includes fishing , and secondly , the activities of the structural funds .    3.7327692238596004
i hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing agenda 2000 .    2.5595885422334064
the agenda 2000 issues are , of course , ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives , the economic and social agenda and a better quality of life .    2.532143711686259
what your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major , high - minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the commission intends to deploy .    2.6731106948966787
i do not necessarily mean financial resources .    2.6214104881420326
the implementation of agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money .    2.712644942734208
there must also be savings .    3.0860424835683253
but what we need is the analytical resources : these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital .    2.2599988874133694
this is because it is essential to achieve two things : the european model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured , and this must be done in a way which UNK the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products , mainly to the benefit of developing countries .    3.056146803691269
it is not easy to combine those aims . there is no obvious way .    2.622225203388483
there may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them .    3.430587595235033
as regards the other aspect of agenda , the aspect of cohesion and regional development , there we do indeed have great achievements to point to , but there are still less developed regions , particularly island regions , to which more attention should be paid .    2.5464789594975867
as for fishing , there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the UNK exploitation of fishing grounds , which has gone as far as to UNK out entire species of fish , will certainly prove fruitful in the future .    3.02459889271392
perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater UNK de UNK .    2.5320824291530646
madam president , i want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five - year plan .    2.573608721745079
in setting very ambitious long - term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present .    3.2009752159256113
that was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group , mr poettering , in his opening address .    2.843252386239225
the union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful european economy being in place .    2.467929449453586
that foundation is clearly the single market .    2.8416609428958184
how strongly is the single market established at the moment ?    3.372586639031715
i want to remind mr prodi , and his colleagues who are still here , of the findings of the commission ' s own survey among UNK european businesses .    3.1937162818772067
nearly 40 % of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications .    2.0645950187749467
this is the commission ' s own survey .    3.5332047912748608
these are the classic symptoms of continued UNK by national governments - bureaucratic red - tape blocking market entry .    2.0570834380123415
the commission ' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market .    2.2810013206605797
we have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers , intensifying pressure on member states who fail to implement single market measures and , of course , extending into crucial new areas like financial services .    2.2983985276880943
only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved .    2.697605025573168
an enlarged europe must build on the existing strengths of the union .    2.670813998241322
the single market extending across that enlarged union is going to be a colossal achievement .    3.0746686089438287
i conclude by saying , on behalf of all my conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this parliament - that we pledge our full support to the commission and to mr prodi in achieving this historic task .    3.2252063576766115
madam president , mr prodi , ladies and gentlemen , at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today .    2.8153202075920953
the serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme .    3.1734079986463652
yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate , if we agree that the european union must be a public authority .    3.2365477872047714
the UNK of the eu institutions , the responsibilities of the member states and the local and regional authorities is all very well .    3.4944937035565555
yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and european construction ?    2.587325053907138
is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about ' who does what ' but more ' what are we doing together ' ?    2.5163690111779053
it is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens .    2.4562469884068543
in your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us . i would add to these the future of our social model .    3.0157874942878258
this is why i and my group are so firmly insisting on the charter of fundamental rights .    2.162022887343185
the reason our timetable includes the drafting of this charter is because we are at a key point in our history . our union needs to redefine the values on which it is based , both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we UNK desire , but not under just any conditions .    2.5662187679983286
our people expect more europe , but not just any europe .    2.8650526455344862
they are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather , on the basis of our social model , to be able to organise globalisation .    3.1556059307573103
in this respect i must say that , in terms of your commitment to a political union , to which we are favourable , this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model , on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world .    3.113153207628056
madam president , mr president of the commission , commissioners , i should like to start with a quote : " the commission will continue to work towards establishing a european charter of fundamental rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme .    3.01170732818411
the commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine european policy on asylum and immigration . it wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime " .    2.902442153318695
a farce because we know and appreciate the work of commissioner vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand .    2.740661412460667
a paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard .    3.295523070167847
it has been UNK and UNK as a huge achievement and i am all for it ; we need a basis for a scoreboard .    3.7970095256105636
we here in parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme .    2.91828289207666
what we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly , and those who are not fleeing know where they stand .    2.353891952933544
we want instruments to prevent abuse .    2.504083508315889
we want to develop a community immigration policy which takes account of the member states ' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of europol , for example , so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime .    3.4105741535378216
we debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the commission , even where it is merely submitting a paper .    3.1350787576717076
madam president , mr president of the commission , commissioners , i rise to speak on the subject of the world trade organisation , on which there is a broad convergence of views between the commission documents and the positions of the socialist group . this is not the case in other areas , as has already been pointed out .    3.367158277649007
we share these views because we are in favour of world trade , but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards , common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind . this aim is that trade should benefit development , and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world ' s most dynamic and competitive regions .    2.788423825216743
on the other hand , what does this statement tell us about principles ?    2.2527813109691404
this regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the world trade organisation , in other words , increased wealth , but when we look at how this wealth is distributed , we see , unfortunately , that the gulf between the world ' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase .    2.5342955948896093
it is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves , what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve ?    2.2358222640527954
what good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the world trade organisation works , if they cause trade to increase on the one hand , but on the other , they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow ?    2.6299288449741858
that is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the commission outlined here for the seattle negotiations and for later ones .    3.038695145763686
we are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious .    3.3511199715410545
we need to be demanding and ensure that social rights , environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations .    2.7593197680313093
most importantly though , we must have a brave and ambitious long - term vision for reform , not just of the wto but also of the UNK , the united nations and above all , of the financial institutions , specifically the imf and the world bank .    3.9738300093053684
we must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation . we must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process , so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly - developed blocks and countries , but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world .    2.854076535188467
having said this , madam president , i am prepared , once again , to be a voice crying in the UNK as a result of the absence of a fishing policy .    3.7326828822849007
it is really surprising that the commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years , in view of the reform which must take place in 2002 .    3.2726398635668095
there is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years .    2.9795959789169806
however , it seems that the commission does not share this view , although it is the commission which is obliged to present the council and parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001 , and it is on this basis that the council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification .    4.132854843874738
in fact , the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions , such as the european parliament , which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy .    2.5900176047430072
we have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply .    2.7838871559829457
less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such UNK should be resolved within the framework of this reform process .    2.886622951613068
therefore , madam president , mr president of the commission , i would ask that this issue , which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the european union , be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years .    3.3335311327674733
madam president , i should like to add my congratulations to commissioner prodi ' s programme .    2.7615668069052974
i particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth : the information society in an expanding european market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity , innovation enterprise , the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra - high value sustainable jobs for our european citizens .    2.0099650187233054
i have one observation , not a criticism , to make regarding commissioner prodi ' s statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy .    3.2887339401998985
we must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the european economy UNK .    3.278406870248919
after all , what is social justice if it is without full employment ?    2.9836165697719914
full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens .    2.73657187065466
i should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the commission which will help us : in particular commissioner liikanen ' s commitment to having an innovative knowledge - driven economy .    2.676798300509713
yes , e - europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs .    2.946292224583695
i welcome the commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium - sized enterprises and i would like to congratulate our portuguese presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro - businesses .    2.63248924163083
that is important and something that can be developed through the lisbon summit .    2.7086969162706405
i also welcome commissioner busquin ' s idea to have a common research area for the whole of the european union .    2.7927808521766826
again , this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity .    3.702407940683567
you said in your summary , commissioner prodi , that liberalisation , competitiveness , keeping inflation low , innovation , science and technology are central for the future success of the european economy and creating jobs .    2.465880289943458
i very much agree with you on that , but we can take nothing for granted .    3.13871454991726
there is still more we have to do , and the lisbon summit will become part of that .    4.093109548244957
so with those remarks i would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success .    2.8821038057286046
madam president , mr president of the commission , i should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme .    3.09183968484774
unfortunately , it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the commission .    2.9986848260642596
as the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group , i would have expected more in the way of agenda from an italian president of the commission .    2.9150838937913153
the commission gives no soul to europe .    2.3122601937366123
just a few main points .    3.136855143508735
i am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture ; they create jobs .    3.181113547922296
i am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas , about consolidating and improving the european dimension of training and education UNK and about networking training and education policies in europe especially lifelong learning .    2.369464217640718
mr president of the commission , it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the UNK - visual area of europe .    3.391422285503961
nor was any mention made of information policy and communications UNK to the needs of our citizens .    2.6995691150373986
it seems to me that something is missing from this programme .    2.5049610168290255
truly european citizenship depends on our creating a real , visible area of training and culture .    2.281456476465231
declarations of principle are not enough .    2.73239962324347
we need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which i have just described .    3.3546711993480924
madam president , mr prodi , how would you take stock of your policy and work programme , what would your benchmark be , if you had to make direct choices ?    2.4426478513193985
you have the fine , charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five - year programme will be the result of the elections , or rather the turnout at the next european elections .    2.5897798813751796
when i think that i have to explain your work programme week in , week out to my constituents , not in the UNK atmosphere of this house , but on the street , then i ask myself , what can i say ?    3.2229698046076787
mr prodi , what can i say ; what is there that is new ?    2.4448907544410954
there is nothing new in your work programme .    2.6784739246408478
you have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year ' s work programme .    2.6897608459779687
does that give me hope for the year 2000 ?    2.7917659120484473
no , it does not !    3.6443986668885735
in your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever .    2.503695027650817
have you done so , mr prodi ; have you even read your work programme for the year ?    3.024721412668771
no , you have not done so .    3.699214002337076
you have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement , despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement .    3.280409495669216
nor have you integrated it into economic policy , competition or the internal market .    2.4709629832661477
you have not integrated it anywhere .    2.6839987731621004
you have UNK a few components together but you have no overall structure .    2.5608481563678374
you said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure ; no , mr prodi , we need , at long last , to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored .    3.2494865334038527
you say in your five - year programme that the people of the european union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation .    2.778462760023437
mr prodi , you do not know what you are talking about .    3.7316852595987275
the foodstuffs legislation in the european union is the most ambitious in the world .    3.508607634973023
where it falls short , what is missing , is transposition in the member states and monitoring .    3.0789477241199794
it is time you took your job seriously , it is time for you , as president of the commission , to box the member states on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties .    3.0494080688372143
it is no good spending time on UNK when there is a day ' s work to be done .    3.0014034468984367
that is what we expect of you in the next five years .    2.8317541097596366
( es ) madam president , mr president of the commission , as chairman of this parliament ' s committee on fisheries , mr prodi , you are not making things easy for me at all .    3.2589012951081746
i feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us .    2.7714299144447816
the next five years of the prodi commission - as you UNK announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change .    2.8099502527428424
i hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing , since the silence of your programme , with regard to fishing , is deafening .    2.71617205211
not a single line , nor a single word , refers to fishing or the cfp .    2.3109241138251817
i am not asking for details or specific points , but i believe that a mention was required .    2.8615436225373583
how could you completely ignore a common - i repeat ; common - policy with such an economic , social and regional impact , and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of europe ?    2.59298425253667
this is all the more serious , if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your commission , mr prodi , has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy , which you are legally required to do in 2002 .    3.241271347849405
does the commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either ?    2.3032786049753486
what message can we send to the fishermen of europe , and their families , and the fishing industries , both the UNK and processing and marketing industries , and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many european ports , in so many european regions , in most cases peripheral regions , who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority ?    2.8928985422431324
you have made an explicit reference to the cap for the coming years , but you have not done so for the cfp , with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context , in the context of globalisation .    3.529440342317468
this house has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second .    3.554840747364818
i would therefore ask you , mr prodi , to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today .    3.152081356560554
our parliamentary group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you .    2.732772038063066
mr president of the commission , this is indeed an historic moment for parliament , a five - year programme following the crisis of the commission .    2.8544383060697687
on behalf of the socialist group , i would like to focus on the point of internal reform .    3.501950858964646
we wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of vice - president , mr kinnock , on behalf of the commission .    3.4002858533357356
we consider it to be of utmost importance that , in terms of financial control , personnel management and bureaucratic short - cuts , we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy , for the benefit of the citizen .    3.152727979815389
at the same time , we are aware that this is a massive programme and that , during the overhaul in the next couple of years , it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in , as before .    3.430825361186471
much like in the netherlands , where , at a given point , women UNK up to the fact that , by referring to european legislation , they could improve their status in terms of social security , this is now also the case for scores of other citizens .    3.448692217792613
they want to see results .    3.453291624588096
democracy , transparency and clarity always lead to results , citizens value results and this is what the commission is judged on .    3.217181585435846
this is exactly the point which mr swoboda and also other members made : fear of modernisation , globalisation , and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security .    2.47131343882773
this can be prevented if a european social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas .    2.3984583887221165
i would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level . this gives the citizen a sense of recognition , here in europe and elsewhere .    2.352692720424996
because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions , such as education and health care .    2.263714736351003
these are really the people who deserve our solidarity .    3.022444449121229
madam president , mr president of the commission , i have read and re - read the commission ' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office .    2.9946525942210074
i am delighted that it is being discussed in parliament , but i also note the compromises and the omissions in it .    3.308146006551123
the commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion , to solidarity between member states and to the european union ' s regional policy .    3.0997653268622596
are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved ?    2.9226400984013146
certainly not !    3.242435909475632
at the same time , it was rightly pointed out that europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries , and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty .    2.5298967083958557
this document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included .    2.711958701496915
i think the fact that the commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious .    3.5855175997217885
it plays down one of the treaties ' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the european institutions ' policies and measures . it seems to ignore the fact that various european regions are still considerably less advanced than others .    3.1125767053254885
it also UNK that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right . unless we achieve real convergence , the cohesion of the european union itself will be at risk .    2.8921383126566464
we should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the european union , for which the commission is responsible .    4.612670057745035
this report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100 , the ten so - called " strongest " regions reached an average of 158 , and the ten so - called " weakest " regions reached a figure of around 50 .    2.3044065964473543
you may draw your own conclusions .    2.5895129788506313
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region , the azores , one of the regions defined in the treaties as ultra - peripheral .    3.258707428012701
i am waiting for the commission ' s report on the ultra - peripheral regions , which the council decided should be drawn up by december 1999 .    3.4083682973761307
i shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion , there will be no cohesion at all , only UNK .    2.703523462708137
madam president , mr prodi , europe needs a strong commission .    2.4881346565455744
this house is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating . you must therefore listen to our opinions , one or two of which i wish to express in my brief speech .    2.502984913068563
firstly , mr president , although your two predecessors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency , it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of european construction .    2.964352128166715
you must not allow yourself to be UNK by the sole issue of enlargement , however important this may be .    3.1446202420889526
you must go further , towards reconciling the people with europe , in particular those people who are falling victim to economic , social and , probably , in the future , technological divisions .    3.1333831741953535
the promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition . the latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health , education , transport , communications , water and whatever else .    2.6888310945182226
your action programme and your objectives are reserved , even silent , specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed .    2.1694688269968134
this is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services .    2.654638729473187
this is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile europe with the people and ensure that the people choose europe rather than jörg haider .    2.9113928824190918
madam president , the commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities .    2.68579254273414
the recent dioxin scare in belgium , prior to that the bse crisis in britain , and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically - modified UNK , have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat .    2.77280403209251
if the commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the european union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of eu citizens .    3.0089082671024148
i therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety , public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the commission ' s work programme for 2000 .    3.5284676602818332
however , i was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a european food authority in the recent white paper .    3.484240525272732
in its present form , what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the commission rather than an independent body that would have decision - and law - making powers more similar to those of the us food and drug administration , which has already established credibility in this particular field .    2.6408028282159712
furthermore , future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the european food authority and the authorities of national member states , for example the food safety authority in ireland .    2.91089921377277
this body , for example , alongside the recently established cross - border body in ireland for food safety , is already doing good work .    2.7363258342755534
it would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in eu legislation .    2.4565653853000176
my fear is that such deficiencies in eu legislation could lead to UNK wars between national and eu bodies , who should be working together rather than against one another .    2.1622233407645775
that is something we must guard against .    2.571158430806354
madam president , the presentation by president prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair .    2.2071141607273983
we will be looking for the detail year by year , for example in the social action programme to be UNK this year .    3.148152779038221
we will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy , and will be applying a number of tests .    3.771535256431437
we will be looking at the extent to which we can create an UNK policy UNK combining economic policy , employment policy and social policy .    3.13811340274119
within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the portuguese presidency .    2.785454754336068
within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect .    3.2713411920020037
the UNK of mergers , UNK and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the UNK of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past ; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive .    3.651476624934711
we also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change .    2.4985226456722516
that is the successful way to manage change , and i hope the commission will act to make sure that is put into place .    3.339133929534802
the aspirations are fine , president prodi , we want those aspirations to be matched by action .    2.54760683180712
madam president , i hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i ' s left for me to UNK .    3.4932022274041716
mr prodi , you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward - looking employment policy throughout europe .    2.1158375718606135
however , for the economic sector which i represent , i . e . fisheries , this means change .    3.1705795956221805
we need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which UNK personal responsibility .    2.4215686029271333
we must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry .    2.343440638955783
what it comes down to is the competitiveness of the european economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing .    3.198037773766169
however , i am sure that i do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor , which affects not only germany but all the coastal regions of europe .    3.021686636950573
plus , this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act , which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too .    3.0394542003577305
this has since been unanimously approved .    2.687852157543213
the fisheries policy is due for review in a few months ' time , i . e . at the beginning of the year 2000 .    3.0772627671507427
so it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper .    3.06559676580305
i hope that this is a misunderstanding .    3.4411936563467296
madam president , many of the speakers from the socialist group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the commission ' s statement .    3.2311236781585353
however , we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the commission .    3.2793525351639126
one area that i want to focus on , in addition to those already identified , is that of cultural diversity in europe .    3.54506051688682
the introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important .    3.160449707656174
but there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity .    3.5413626267778135
if we are to ensure that we defeat the fear - UNK amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other , both within the present european union and among those who seek to join us and , indeed , among those in other parts of europe and the world who want to come and live and work in europe .    2.748701199363345
unless we address these issues , unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes , unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse europe , we will fail .    2.4542910857748175
those who are currently coming to the fore in europe based on fear will win the day .    2.6255436831859704
i am seriously concerned that unless the commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a UNK europe , we will make progress on the economic front , on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy , but our citizens will still remain UNK because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand .    3.0334202880023415
if we do not take steps to deal with that , we will fail ultimately .    3.792496114212978
thank you , mr de UNK .    2.5172892815404246
before giving the floor again to the president of the commission , i must tell you that i have received , pursuant to rule 37 , seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate .    3.180912366727188
welcome    3.614357701079869
i would like to inform you that there is a delegation from UNK , led by his UNK , sheikh UNK al - UNK , vice - prime minister and defence minister , here in the official gallery .    2.9077203030072085
on behalf of the house , i would like to welcome you to the european parliament .    3.9452026244667198
mr president , i should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the association of parliamentary assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible .    2.5399388431228966
i understand that on 26 january the association wrote to the college of quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the hemicycle today to publicise their initiative .    2.1574704467198473
on the same day , i understand , mr balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead .    2.7040386423773146
the parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements .    2.5945845741194433
however , the appointment was cancelled at the last minute .    2.5231400731928204
parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn .    2.672072042845884
can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute ?    2.5737813212613307
do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard ?    2.820231214802107
will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible ?    2.9559256054346794
finally , will you make sure that in the meantime parliament ' s rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid , as they should be , on the basis of all the work they do for us ?    3.707990483243393
without them we would not be able to function .    3.9951091009162494
mr president , i also rise on a point of order .    2.257326517506682
are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this parliament , outside the doors of the hemicycle , to ensure that meps are free to come into this hemicycle to discharge their mandate ?    2.434161633250338
if there are such rules , who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility ?    2.4828413744098845
mr president , i would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants , which we have always considered to be a priority , and inform you that - as the italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader , mr barón crespo , we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the quaestors .    3.117839931506999
i think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway .    3.515413486996896
i would therefore like to call on the presidency of parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the presidency itself to invite the members to do likewise .    2.869655416477552
mr president , first of all let me say that i am in full support of a statute for assistants .    3.0348234790266164
as all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are UNK first of all through the comart committee of parliament .    2.605156622856263
to give a non - contentious example , no commercial exhibitions can be held here in parliament for obvious reasons .    2.550628052657528
following a letter i received yesterday , i immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration , probably in the near future and possibly in the next month .    2.4702999976132447
but all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of parliament .    2.6373017228053803
i signed a letter yesterday afternoon , in the meeting of the bureau of parliament , in which the assistants were informed of this .    3.5226248207106075
but i am also told that they were informed UNK of this decision by the committee of chairmen of groups last thursday , so they were fully aware of the decision .    2.9824226707515202
there is no problem with them telling us the way they feel , there is no problem with a possible meeting during parliament ' s next part - session .    2.8414196958585265
but there was some misunderstanding , for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission .    2.1366855904956186
but all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so - called comart committee .    2.4883650442162915
as you can see we have many exhibitions around parliament , whether they be about different countries or whatever .    2.3638394559264384
this is not an attempt to either UNK or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants .    3.0180124951538776
thank you , mrs banotti .    2.480714149767561
i think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised .    2.2379889390218985
mr president , i wanted to point out an important matter of principle .    2.7983367193194826
i personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear members of this parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem , which is fair conditions , fair pay and fair hours .    2.8876639940916338
we shall now proceed to the vote . 1    2.4763051135579706
vote    3.1522193301854244
mr president , i am speaking on behalf of the spanish delegation of the european people ' s party , the delegation of the spanish people ' s party , with regard to mrs terrón i cusí ' s resolution on the area of freedom , security and justice .    2.784738248100551
there have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the group of the european people ' s party , and we have voted in favour of the terrón i cusí resolution , which we consider on the whole to be excellent .    3.2061092591870906
however , we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6 , because they seem to us to be legally incorrect .    2.8993645125299476
on the other hand , we have voted in favour of recital UNK which , in fact , is in line with what i , as draftsperson of the opinion of the committee on citizens ' freedoms , proposed to that committee , with a view to the intergovernmental conference .    2.8867155772154534
we have also voted in favour of paragraph 13 .    2.8472940405489524
an appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non - eu countries is something which the spanish people ' s party has been advocating for some time .    2.773393171238337
for similar reasons , we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which , with the oral amendment , dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity , since political rights , not just voting in local elections , but political rights in general terms , form part of the sovereignty of member states .    3.0872826717220767
given the oral amendment , we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done .    3.768378762931367
.    2.489189446364389
( da ) the danish social democratic members of the european parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution , but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the danish delegation in the group of the party of european socialists naturally wishes to respect .    2.736933064629046
this report which i voted against is less concerned with human rights than with ' communitisation ' or the consolidation of fortress europe .    2.3202221772008036
the supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the dublin conventions and schengen agreements and a further action plan from tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants .    2.1241786147285215
in terms of human rights , this is a backward step .    4.413134980633038
europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees . yet some applicant countries in central and eastern europe are taking in UNK refugees expelled en masse from belgium .    2.1575417858141948
kosovo albanians and serb UNK are being refused refugee status , whereas pinochet is calmly UNK prosecution .    2.0457852884112935
the europe of schengen clearly finds it much easier to UNK the persecuted from the south than dictators , even though the un estimates that we will need UNK million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025 .    2.5876409186778235
europe should UNK the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections . only then can we talk in this house about an area of freedom and justice .    2.815733708688577
mccarthy report ( a5 - 0026 / 2000 )    3.2371538273945117
mr president , i would firstly like to point out that i was mayor of bilbao during the nineties , which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the commission .    2.4800077710602224
our experience with that pilot project in bilbao led us to four conclusions : firstly , that europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore , far from reducing the eur 900 million for the last five year period to eur 700 million for this five year period , the funding of this project should be increased . this should be done , for example - and the group of the greens / european free alliance has proposed this - by UNK , in urban projects , that portion of the structural funds which each member state has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose .    2.6298707461155595
disparate actions are not effective .    2.7170148420561673
we have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy , in accordance with the objectives set , that is to say , the social , economic , environmental and democratic management dimensions , as well as the relationship between them .    2.8601385154123333
thirdly , we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other community programmes , as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question .    2.9692666093754165
finally , we have to put our trust in , and support , the institutions which are closest to the citizens , that is , the local councils and bodies .    3.3954848938854063
they have more first - hand knowledge of social needs . they have more involvement in the problems and , furthermore , they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy , and thereby achieve better results .    2.269149503962676
lastly , in today ' s vote on our four amendments , two have been approved and the other two rejected .    2.574780508033239
this has obliged us to abstain from the final vote , because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each member state can dedicate , to urban projects , that portion of the structural funds which it has not spent in accordance with community programmes .    2.827600389316344
mr president , the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism had an in - depth discussion on the urban initiative which produced many ideas .    2.2775720184995234
as the smallest community initiative in existence , we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected .    2.546172732543072
we regret this as there was actually money left over from the structural funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects . we should remember that it is these urban projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established .    2.6127666999765937
the commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place . it should make urban projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled ' sustainable urban policy ' .    2.471681441722498
mr president , i would like to point out that i voted for this report on sustainable urban development , known as urban .    2.556523151612763
as with all other community initiatives , this is very positive .    3.6211855916072215
europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of europe and not simply for the development of an individual state , UNK one it may be .    3.1291241493604516
urban is designed to find solutions to urban UNK , and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the pensioners ' party .    3.0051588002639966
there can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city .    2.2144833843616367
i hope that this community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities .    2.6339915368502176
. ( da ) the left ' s five members of the european parliament have chosen to support leader + , the equal initiative and interreg , but not urban .    2.89258733874904
. ( da ) we have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the commission concerning the guidelines for a community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development ( urban ) .    2.581172857193324
basically , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think , in general , that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations , as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects .    2.758355259229788
it underlines the fact that , in order to ensure sustainable urban development , an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis , namely the unemployed , immigrants , refugees , women and the socially excluded .    2.9817457194670127
however , nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it .    2.72603993321726
at best this report simply UNK certain aspects and effects of the crisis . yet only UNK limited resources are available for this work .    2.3780958460722696
as the report itself indicates , the funds allocated to the urban ii programme for the 2000 - 2006 period are approximately 30 % less than those in the previous period , which were already low , at eur 900 million . added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of europe which is pathetic when practically all european city districts , both UNK and inner city , are affected .    2.554613630804688
this is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap .    2.735357839030958
- ( fr ) mrs mccarthy , ladies and gentlemen , i am very pleased that the urban community initiative is being continued as this aims to support the social and economic conversion of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis , all with a view to achieving sustainable urban development .    2.702444866076377
with some 80 % of the population of europe living in an urban area , cities are at the forefront of economic , social and cultural change in europe .    2.6852687273599773
at the same time , the social and economic problems facing european society are more pronounced in urban areas .    2.4402772649004887
many european cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high - added - value activities and high - income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes , high unemployment , UNK and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency .    2.033725616764517
the concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved .    2.8348877284978853
this is why the european parliament successfully called for the urban community initiative or cip to be extended during the reform of the structural funds .    2.73869886794339
the success of urban during the 1994 - 1999 programming period is UNK .    2.4560513191570696
the results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas .    3.4762373929747965
this cip has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic , social and environmental sectors .    2.799858997984302
it has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities , the non - governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration .    2.591323319769619
the new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them , while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups .    2.1319625736002603
we can therefore welcome its adoption .    2.5298817574945383
we must , however , admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory !    2.5779170411311574
the total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge .    2.9353997929454545
the amount for the 1994 - 1999 period was eur 900 million and will be eur 700 million for the 2000 - 2006 period . this represents a drop of 30 % !    2.401266519257595
this reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new urban initiative .    3.455827693361461
the chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low .    2.2424310903980107
it needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the member states .    2.692745403999279
in view of this concentration on a limited number of projects , the publication and dissemination of the results of the new urban community initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect .    2.795230361933496
the mccarthy report on the urban community initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of community intervention in urban matters .    2.8135012157952315
the situation of certain urban areas is alarming , with the social distress taking the form of unemployment , misery and crime .    2.879279915553366
drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency .    2.3277076113649082
faced with these social challenges , the effectiveness of the structural funds is still in doubt .    2.9020313462868215
subsidiarity should make us realise that the state , exercising its governing functions , and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately . the state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people .    2.336783288545424
although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises , the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way .    2.725885579869527
the urban community initiative is helping to achieve the european union ' s desire to UNK urban policy .    3.241888313768994
it would be more appropriate for the eu to concentrate its financial efforts on pre - existing european policies .    2.8708130062056276
clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget UNK race which is particularly UNK when the convergence criteria for emu are imposing a very strict UNK regime on the national budgets .    2.092373703088251
mrs mccarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to urban and the promotion of this community initiative through a costly communication campaign UNK the benefits of a federal europe .    2.526572043766362
we should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project .    2.631557232412448
in fact , the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted .    2.073294471137455
the aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility .    3.2548483620084583
finally , the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or UNK minorities .    3.0952401510639236
we can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion .    2.26748193473721
on one hand , this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their UNK into the culture of the host country . this would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder UNK .    2.4927600422666742
on the other hand , it UNK the principle of positive discrimination . this is a politically correct UNK which can be just as harmful , as shown by the us precedent .    3.149348853855817
for all these reasons , the french delegation of the uen group could not approve the mccarthy report .    2.5594672792829125
decourrière report ( a5 - 0028 / 2000 )    3.239004113338659
mr president , the interreg programme is particularly close to our hearts .    2.5036531728292526
like many of my colleagues , i am pleased that the european parliament was able to safeguard this initiative .    3.8785342566536625
as i live in the UNK - UNK - UNK UNK region of belgium , i am well aware that the regions are where europe is being created . they are where we live the european experience on a daily basis and where the people make european construction come alive .    3.1136007209747985
these projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development .    2.7270187674521456
why am i stressing this point ?    2.615812295274933
the answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted .    2.962213219597864
for example , to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the european union . this goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions , for example .    2.7900142346940506
i would also ask the commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the eu ' s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing co2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed .    2.768070260985268
i am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction .    2.7933060733552
we know that some member states are still UNK , for example , between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the pyrenees , as in the UNK valley .    3.2647464629277425
however , i am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway , the UNK .    2.466358030559252
in this respect too , i would ask the commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies , specifically in the interreg programmes which are being submitted .    3.34865558949677
mr president , i voted for the decourrière report on the community initiative interreg , mainly because of the reply commissioner barnier gave to some members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers . i voted for it , not just because i was born in a coastal town , UNK , but above all because the frontiers of regions UNK by the sea are frontiers too .    2.5265491024902698
these frontiers stretch as far as african states and the middle east : we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of europe .    3.4825653969584853
as an mep from a border region , i welcome this third interreg initiative with great interest .    2.8222268885539674
we can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically , socially and culturally .    2.5080881168188247
due to the existence of these borders , they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong . this has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy .    2.8117343729622766
this is why the interreg community initiative was launched in 1990 .    2.5390348075647786
this programme was designed to encourage cross - border , transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the union .    2.98141832433932
interreg serves principally to fund community schemes to develop smes , education and training , cultural exchanges , action to combat health problems , the protection and improvement of the environment , energy , transport and telecommunications networks .    2.7541444443731256
i must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of european integration .    2.9009914198863527
more active participation by these authorities in community initiatives should be promoted , bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border .    2.576708993823065
in cross - border cooperation , greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium - sized undertakings which are the job creators .    2.7385744324437216
in the same respect , given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50 % of all unemployment , the interreg funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment .    2.697174021228721
obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing , UNK or hindering cross - border mobility .    2.4598918508440986
i hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region !    3.014056591740282
interreg resources must also contribute to the development of a european research area .    3.462421504500813
finally , and in particular , expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through interreg !    2.289714799520311
the challenges are therefore immense . the integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future european regional development policy !    3.2519713882569037
i hope everyone , like mr decourrière , whom i congratulate , will realise this !    2.481740978577492
- ( fr ) the interreg community initiative is just one element of an ill - UNK european regional policy .    2.514920111863144
this apparently generous policy , officially intended to help problem regions , is a UNK ' s bargain for french taxpayers .    2.7549628914803668
france contributes 17 % of the european budget yet will receive only 8 % of the regional structural funds .    3.3161970558931015
between 1994 and 1999 , our regions annually received an average of ff 15 . 4 billion but will receive only ff 14 . 7 billion between 2000 and 2006 .    2.0636627010826425
my region of UNK - pas - de - calais will be particularly affected with french UNK losing the aid paid to objective 1 regions .    2.1709357690531754
this loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free - trade europe .    2.161935049792263
the european regional policy also reinforces the UNK of brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the structural funds .    2.898170069674564
this is a europe of regions in which the regions , which are weaker than the nation states , will easily submit to brussels .    3.332080469008908
the interreg initiative , launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a europe without borders and therefore without nations , sits comfortably within this philosophy .    2.30263131466002
however , mr decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the brussels technocrats .    1.958158844229505
these failings will result in particular in the late implementation of interreg iii and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid .    2.52481791563027
we also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium - sized undertakings and , of course , about refusing to use outside service providers .    2.598789007443747
these are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous commission .    2.6066505367940738
however , these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted , in no way remedy the eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the community initiatives , particularly interreg .    2.262241188790826
this is why the national front voted against the report .    2.7120427176553097
the european parliament has delivered an opinion on the commission guidelines for the interreg community initiative concerning cross - border , transnational and interregional cooperation .    2.8015026386413853
i want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this community initiative .    2.8325139214067523
this does not involve the concerns about the future of the atlantic UNK but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand a on cross - border cooperation .    3.201297165124318
in the commission guidelines , few maritime areas are eligible for interreg iiia . the amendments to the decourrière report aim to make interreg more maritime - oriented .    2.299434471060921
this is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the eu which is at stake .    4.202801731414251
i am aware of the commission ' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the UNK on the presentation of interreg iii last november .    3.297208595197978
however , i must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation .    2.7374761001902677
one example of this is the ' celtic ' area which encompasses the territories of brittany in france , UNK and UNK in the united kingdom and cork and UNK in ireland . this is an area whose locally - based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri - foodstuffs sector .    3.199439748723027
it also has excellent cultural and UNK links , through UNK for example . interreg iii , strand a , would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium - sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer .    2.611676419657317
the european commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions .    2.862577352657033
this policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in brittany in that catches could be UNK at irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the breton agri - foodstuffs industry .    2.2836171131899365
the integration of the maritime border into strand a would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the ' UNK ' of the european union .    2.3692847277905056
this would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east .    2.2935242469118866
the maritime world has great potential .    2.646213628112395
we therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of europe to be defined .    2.3953514993608263
. ( da ) the european project began as a partnership between states .    2.2844429988160178
this partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of europe for over 50 years .    2.6274055957074616
as a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world , of which the eu is just one proof , and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our western values , competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades .    3.395065548884816
the eu should be prepared to meet that competition .    2.8043212401847573
we can only do that by intensifying co - operation within the community .    2.6073912740686707
it should not be about greater integration of the eu countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders .    3.065726528146055
it is about co - operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides .    2.1172725470670706
a programme such as interreg is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders , projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at european level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale .    2.6527986281715634
i therefore welcome the continuation of the programme .    3.0747437111401807
. ( fr ) mr decourrière ' s report is not without merit : at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the interreg initiative and its role in opening up border regions , it comes out in favour of smes in paragraph 16 .    2.912285443518609
i and my colleague dominique souchet , who is well versed in this matter , have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of smes and craft trades within the framework of interreg , the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and i welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously .    3.2385352849542657
nonetheless , the french delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the commission and the federalist UNK have diverted the interreg initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations .    2.9970809232726214
we have no intention of giving brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the member states , as suggested in recital of the report .    2.8450114092955063
we only ask one thing of the commission : that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories .    2.673204013324533
the destructive effects of the cap and emu on the balance between regions , especially on the UNK of the more rural , the more remote and the least populated regions , is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a UNK , far from it .    3.213829457883073
this UNK with strand iiic is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that ' the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co - operation ' ( p . 17 ) and that ' the responsibilities are UNK and vague ' ( p . 18 ) .    2.2192469889798834
calling under these circumstances , as he does in paragraph 20 , for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological UNK tactics which are customary in this house .    2.635793490542841
lastly , there is the desire expressed both in the commission document and mr decourrière ' s report of using interreg for peace and reconstruction in the balkans : i do not think that the structural funds should be used to repair the damage which the americans UNK on serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual .    3.0645348801573715
it is up to washington , not us , to assume responsibility for a conflict which was UNK merely to serve its interests .    2.2450616691507137
the french delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote .    2.582586222433417
procacci report ( a5 - 0025 / 2000 )    3.209942955095198
mr president , i voted for the procacci report on rural development , not only because i endorse the major policy lines of the leader programme , but also because it complements the urban programme , which i spoke about earlier .    2.9487663078669812
just as elderly people in cities are very isolated , so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities : they are drawn by the UNK lights , and the pubs , and the countryside and rural areas are being emptied .    2.5309171946650553
i therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this european union plan and for it to be further developed .    3.0144287342367044
- ( pt ) although this community initiative , leader + , follows on from previous initiatives , it has some unique features .    2.70227613286328
one of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period .    2.2436789750414956
nevertheless , new objectives have been included , specifically the financing of the nature network 2000 , for which all rural regions will be eligible .    2.6672021749114876
in spite of the fact that this community initiative is aimed at rural development , it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way , and this is unacceptable .    3.371743229539353
without agriculture , the rural world will disappear .    2.7330132849798408
this means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture ' s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world .    2.637582369118536
our position on leader is a product of our more general assessment of the eu ' s overall agricultural policy .    3.1365632511250165
both leader 1 and leader 2 , which were implemented in the 1990s , were ingredients of the new cap that emerged after its review in 1992 and , along with other respective measures , they constituted the so - termed second pillar of the eu ' s rural development policy .    2.5828395569079654
their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new cap ' s disastrous consequences and the UNK of small and medium - scale farmers , and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives .    2.361575211951085
this is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented , farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly , which resulted in their depopulation .    2.605058396775074
a characteristic example is greece , which as an objective 1 country was included as a whole in the leader community initiatives , and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2 . 3 % , while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15 . 2 % .    2.4690112446906105
the real aims of leader + are the same as those of leaders 1 and 2 , in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the cap to be implemented in the context of agenda 2000 and the wto .    2.943891843716994
the selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under leader do , in the best case , moderate some partial problems of the countryside , which are of secondary importance , but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience .    2.7219446829110474
in no case , however , are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature .    2.871808637572594
the actual appropriations available for leader + compared with leader 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15 % ( from eur 1 UNK million for leader 2 to eur 2 020 million for leader + ) .    2.013663681444734
this is because the 15 % increase is nominal and not real , granted that average yearly inflation in the community during those years was approximately 2 % .    2.131977079413001
leader + will last a year longer than leader 2 .    2.448851049229379
leader + can cover all the regions of the eu , while leader 2 covered only the objective 1 regions and some objective 5b and 6 regions .    2.615790878809459
we must point out , however , that even if the actual appropriations available for leader + were increased , the community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti - farming nature of the cap that will be implemented in the context of ' agenda 2000 ' and the wto . the real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover - up , to lead people off the UNK and to UNK consciences .    2.8217475363655544
we disagree with many of the report ' s views .    3.8782536430456815
once more , we point to the negative changes of the cap ( 1992 - agenda 2000 ) .    2.4886363351368654
for our part , we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes .    2.492622811968449
we will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted , and most important of all , we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous cap which is UNK them and leading them towards economic decline and the UNK of the countryside .    2.6251318974491205
unless this cap is UNK , no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium - scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside .    2.652188412807132
all the members in the union for a europe of nations group voted in favour of almost the whole of the procacci report on the leader + community initiative .    3.1694355829182554
however , we amended the draft report adopted by the committee on agriculture and rural development in order to clarify certain points which will make this community initiative more effective .    2.9008927127931563
in particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the leader ii initiative .    2.2573721963718425
it was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of leader + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density .    2.7327365634993637
amendment no 10 which i tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of ' economic and social cohesion ' rather than ' regional development ' as the european union does not have any recognised competence in this area .    3.0407561565531753
amendment no 11 replaces ' government or municipal officials ' with ' government officials ' .    2.1678892320329717
although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio - economic sectors of the territory concerned , government officials must be involved at decision - making level , whether they come from the municipalities , departments , regions or national governments .    2.3881719639665038
the rapporteur ' s UNK was therefore too limiting .    3.1823153786648097
amendment no 12 responds to the expectations of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism of this house .    2.4523342338115626
it specifies the necessary coordination between leader + and community cooperation and partnership programmes such as interreg , phare , sapard or meda .    2.0276228685844497
in the territory of member states of the european union , applicant countries or member states of UNK , there may be UNK between the various community initiatives .    3.7738592403124884
the real priority for the european continent is to establish an operational level within a european framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur .    3.0403913602422903
the creation of organisations similar to the lags may be usefully encouraged by the european union , provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners .    2.817915283030325
in essence , we are , of course , in favour of this leader + community initiative .    3.3639174965884053
the conference on rural development held in cork from 7 to 9 november 1996 set rural development as one of the european union ' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric , including infrastructure , public and private services and so on .    2.391434771926677
in this context , in committee we regretted the UNK funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this community initiative so that it matches the previous leader i and leader ii initiatives .    2.4127270019661
the budget allocated to leader + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to leader ii for a period of six years .    2.3219290894860154
this is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the cap following the berlin agreements .    2.9124850641539846
finally , among the priority parameters to be introduced at european level to enable local involvement , particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by lags within the leader ii initiative , but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified .    2.4465603330629198
( the sitting was suspended at 1 . 40 p . m . and resumed at 3 p . m . )    1.7495771525754087
additives in feedingstuffs    4.387522155335272
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0015 / 2000 ) by mr graefe zu baringdorf , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a council directive amending directive 70 / 524 / eec concerning additives in feedingstuffs ( com ( 1999 ) 388 - c5 - 0134 / 1999 - 1999 / 0168 ( cns ) .    1.9732822755511163
mr president , commissioner byrne , under directive 70 / 524 , high - technology additives are treated differently , depending on the date of authorisation .    2.2030811247428925
the commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances UNK before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now .    1.995778920525426
as far as we in the committee on agriculture and rural development are concerned , so far so good .    3.05070113574386
however , the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics , drugs , growth - promoters and genetically - modified organisms .    2.0951498846988703
that makes it a question of health , not just approximating laws , which is why we in the committee on agriculture take the view that the legal base - article 37 - is not admissible here and that the commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of article 152 , that is to say with codecision by parliament .    3.4340347236776374
we asked the opinion of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , which pointed out that , as far as approximating laws is concerned , article 37 is adequate in this case .    2.961957243606182
however , we in the committee on agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws ; because this proposal also encompasses genetically - modified organisms , we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health .    2.519170475690398
we negotiated with the commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically - modified organisms in the directive , taking the text on which directive 70 / 524 is based as a starting point .    2.5946589034763274
mr byrne , we fail to understand why the commission is not approximating the text on genetically - modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work .    2.961052633558727
we have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the commission on the text .    2.7894959352081345
moreover , this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well .    3.313672867687399
the commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future .    2.5250713169515993
however , that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives .    3.0220183393254008
we are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically - modified organisms .    2.712339945093611
directive 70 / 524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the commission until 1988 , while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and parliament obviously did not accord genetically - modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when i was rapporteur .    2.371793879482837
we therefore assume , commissioner byrne , that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base .    2.6657006314253815
if you do not , we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you , exactly as we did with the seed directive . i should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise , both for your legal service and ours .    2.7299788821863675
i can hardly wait , commissioner byrne , to hear what you have to say to our proposals .    3.160741567641319
mr president , commissioner , does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy ?    2.1636885472459513
as far the commission and the legal affairs committee are concerned , it comes under competition .    3.5190711122658636
of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988 .    2.7347355772188284
however , as mr graefe zu baringdorf has said in his report , this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter .    3.172451335565206
food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions .    2.2792948601525027
when we talk of transparency in the food chain , that applies from the UNK to the table UNK and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs .    2.9792903054944686
the antibiotics , growth promoters and genetically - modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain .    2.3804409492270264
the dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction .    2.515776594746858
according to article 152 of the ec treaty , we are obliged to UNK sources of danger to human health , whereby the UNK is clearly on sources .    2.994577704587744
consequently , we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger , i . e . harmful additives in feedingstuffs .    2.735061108207242
otherwise , in my view , we are UNK away at the symptoms , but not the causes .    3.6061896059786047
people are especially UNK of gmos .    2.753618866106499
we must confront increasing public awareness of gmos by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly .    2.171204095341621
first , if an additive consists of or contains genetically - modified organisms , then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment .    2.3271342229930267
secondly , it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically - modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation , as the rapporteur has said .    2.7110179979688636
and thirdly , if we are to have a transparent consumer policy , we need to label genetically - modified feedingstuffs .    3.6851646191125718
a clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice , both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer .    2.3142618143433884
responsible citizens should , in my view , have a choice .    3.2076262134484934
we all talk of UNK citizens who have lost confidence in food safety .    2.3235818547527254
by regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently , we can help significantly to restore confidence .    2.9659406746544317
i too , therefore , can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments .    3.40938273416337
consequently , we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be .    2.373404488270237
mr president , this proposal to amend the UNK directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs .    3.2091203060609974
in other words , we shall be discussing other proposals here in parliament over the next few months .    2.8065783556545854
that this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin , UNK , sludge and other scandals have attracted .    2.3622032349412456
in other words , this is an important facet of public health protection , which is why we believe that article 152 should be taken as the legal base , not article 37 , as proposed by the commission .    3.131853778531458
the amendment which the commission has proposed , namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 december 1987 , is UNK and has our full support .    2.57822905271687
the regulation proposed by the commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives .    2.70566173983187
only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded .    2.6506731202890794
this sort of monopoly , which could lead , for example , to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs , should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 april 1998 .    2.5430751784355308
this would then apply until the re - assessment procedure has been completed .    2.524839003605816
the most important amendment to the commission proposal is the inclusion , as recommended by the rapporteur , of genetically - modified organisms in the directive on additives , taking the compromise negotiated between parliament and the commission on authorisation for gmos outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point .    2.9668581199347543
this already gives us a basis for the authorisation of gmos .    2.9201507581865624
it is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case , just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas , such as forest reproductive material , to mention just one example .    2.788889504021645
the labelling of genetically - modified additives is particularly important in this respect .    2.9403273263590863
on the one hand , it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and , on the other hand , it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using gmos .    2.3975965465186744
finally , our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur , who has gone to a great deal of trouble .    3.110560920290843
i think that we can all hardly wait to hear mr byrne ' s reply .    2.5017995292792223
mr president , the report deals mainly with formalities , in other words , the manner in which additives will be authorised . it is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work .    2.3820387785986163
i should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that , in future , all the directives are dealt with under article 152 , since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview .    2.66410859600237
we cannot carry on as we have done up until now , that is to say dealing with each detail on its own , often only after the harm has already been done .    2.8975370572893713
the rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of gmos in feed additives .    2.2769529677913827
however , i should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics .    3.2383257574176025
certainly , five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned .    2.343859243316182
it is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four , both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves .    2.9854925962768886
we now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people ' s health , particularly in the case of small children .    2.7825582723104287
a number of member states are already able to show UNK that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary .    2.59037481033613
we talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but , in the case of antibiotics , it has long since been forgotten .    3.525069420908873
however , there is another environmental principle at stake , namely the exchange principle .    2.907964284286833
i should like to say a few words about coccidiostats .    2.3552802971546294
they are a UNK product which is not totally necessary .    3.4000174344202825
there is a substitute , which is used to UNK UNK .    3.774673948873119
although it is a little more expensive , it does not harm the environment .    3.6307121748191724
coccidiostats now accompany the UNK that is spread on the fields . in that way , they end up in our water supplies which , as we all know , are our most vital resource .    2.7455743709872547
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives .    2.15471821115232
you may recall , even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public , that the commission ' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin - loaded chemical UNK in the UNK of UNK fruit imported from brazil .    2.7710390646140906
we must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals .    2.4828978587131196
incidentally , it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our UNK , UNK and other domestic animals .    3.2377937512364916
is it because of cut - throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri - foodstuffs industry ?    2.1296295343891387
such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate , even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters .    2.8110446735221513
the UNK which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our UNK .    3.0743490844079115
as forcefully underlined by this report , labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock .    2.4037778702028247
he must also know whether his UNK of protein UNK includes gmos as these components could represent a risk to public health .    1.9758655494627109
however , before labelling we need clear rules .    2.307064149577056
straight questions must be asked about the real end - use of animal UNK , for example .    2.702906754782287
although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms , it is their use which must be questioned today .    3.084100794840282
in this respect , the chapter of the white paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions .    2.1601626947718224
the commission has on many occasions used the farm - to - table example which our colleague in the ppe group has just underlined .    2.3946791651074517
this is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and , to do this , the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time .    3.0262969395626773
this is why it is essential to approve amendment no 2 to recital 4 which UNK the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re - evaluation procedure .    2.3450463515521216
also , amendments nos 4 and 5 to the new article UNK must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such , thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions .    2.511465208115195
mr president , because of the availability of high - technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry , detailed information on their use is needed from the actors , and as we know there are a lot of them , so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe community law .    2.8553086606160014
this directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own .    2.8443251716984106
other directives will follow and i believe that the committee on agriculture is well placed to deal with them .    3.274800260824739
up the point at which meat , milk , bread and other products are sold over the shop counter , feedingstuffs and additives are structured , mixed , UNK , cut and transported several times .    1.9836368150289994
the fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems , just as it does in the foodstuffs industry .    2.6230176178739004
the negative consequences are well known , the positive ones less so .    2.665670265423255
i am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of european citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region .    2.780313432082619
however , more work is needed on this .    2.442442600284455
mr president , may i commence by congratulating the rapporteur , mr graefe zu baringdorf , on his report .    2.412900880736346
it reflects the views and concerns of all eu citizens in the area of food safety and quality .    3.11733831995898
the events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health .    2.665642935391138
the swift action taken by this parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future , for you have set an agenda on food quality to which member states must UNK .    2.8119544477282252
but even in this crucial area of administration , parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging member states to take on and to face up to their responsibility .    2.746554482018874
in agenda 2000 , we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens : food safety , water quality , environmental protection and rural development .    3.2473388796400178
if we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence , the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people - focused and very much reflect community needs .    2.5636794230577187
i welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds .    2.472630418609442
those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely .    2.656658817903865
i compliment the new commissioner responsible for food safety , mr byrne .    2.721624678796568
he has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this house , as well as to the concern of consumers .    2.9420593221500835
i am particularly pleased that my own country , ireland , is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability .    3.159844978344062
mr president , commissioner , i too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work . i am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group .    2.9579690765357722
it is therefore specified that , through the adoption of a regulation , the commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation . this will occur at the same time for all the additives in question .    2.869928286753446
a coherent legal framework must be re - established .    2.5310878254305447
as of october 1999 the commission proposed introducing a legal basis into directive 70 / 524 / eec for the UNK of the authorisations .    2.757141805829821
however , we must ensure that competition distortions are not created , as highlighted by mr kindermann and mrs auroi .    2.2569025157692555
genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end - consumer to choose food without gmo components or based on gmo components and to guarantee this .    2.665789624642083
the consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision .    3.0276036817427596
this proposal has no financial consequences for the community budget .    3.053603410692148
there must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety .    2.6703647269306026
i am sure that the commission can accept the report which , as you know , was approved unanimously in the committee on agriculture and rural development .    3.1737047460702756
mr president , we have said in this house time and again since the bse crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection .    2.8766259764420137
we therefore welcome the commission ' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs .    2.8863116765471624
the committee on behalf of which i am speaking , namely the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection , decided in december , on the assumption that the chairman of the committee on agriculture would draft such a good report , that we could waive our opinion .    3.3301001815378317
nevertheless , i should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points .    3.032594391203961
first , perhaps , i should say something on the question of the legal base .    3.7505384502537846
even if we have new rules of procedure in parliament , and it may well be that , with such an ambitious chairman in the committee on agriculture , problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the committee on agriculture and the committee on the environment , one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict : cohesion in this parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as i am concerned .    3.1802121009816307
therefore , and i must address this comment to you mr byrne , i reject your choice of legal basis .    2.649385006708192
if it is merely a hand - me - down legal basis taken over from previous directives , then it is a mistake to keep it .    2.7917545915947386
the treaty of amsterdam states quite clearly that , where people ' s health is concerned , article 152 is the correct legal base , and may i say to our own committee on legal affairs and the internal market that it is simply not good enough to look at the commission ' s proposal and say , there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection , so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection .    3.094627200899389
my group , as mr kindermann has already said , will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and i hope that other groups in this house will do likewise .    3.3299568890311386
mr byrne , i ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation .    3.3041889954649526
if we do not change it and we follow the legal affairs committee , we shall be opening the UNK to manipulation .    3.0797110150738347
the commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an article 37 .    2.7776709277605285
allow me to comment briefly on two other points . first , genetically modified micro - organisms in feedingstuffs .    2.211830441771341
we cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law .    2.593621532345588
we do not have another law at the moment , and until we do , we must deal with genetically - modified micro - organisms as and when we pass legislation ; we must include them as an add - on and insist that they be labelled .    2.650220020786228
the rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign .    3.627935361910293
i say now , as i have said on numerous occasions in the past : yes , i too would like the commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this house , but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs .    3.3197864460420603
it is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the member states .    2.425786338484394
there are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet .    3.277973105331528
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .    2.1621667262917903
this is an issue that we will no doubt be UNK on a number of occasions in the future .    3.5683137410212273
what has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers .    2.7286170247825208
we must strike a balance between them .    2.7427383303547237
we must resolve this issue , because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat .    3.2065180752413482
one way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned .    3.380904145155278
gmos are the new challenge facing us .    2.704667586236623
this is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so : i myself share these concerns .    2.3007152793494012
but i think we should not allow our concerns about gmos to UNK our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed .    2.537032963643798
indeed , we should not allow gmos to obscure the fact that meat and UNK are still included in animal feeds in many countries in europe .    2.671985983373215
one factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between member states on the cost of the production of food .    3.362242685903862
these are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field : food must be of the same standard in all member states .    3.0961796043486545
we have had the dioxin scare , bse and many other problems .    2.5492676172717923
the main problem is a financial one , namely who bears the cost ?    2.586778838907893
the problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer : the producer has been forced to bear all the cost .    2.4466400322010258
we need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred .    2.6092363147371134
if we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future .    2.3938331017085996
. i should first like to thank the committee on agriculture and rural development and its rapporteur , the committee chairman , mr graefe zu baringdorf , for examining the commission ' s proposal .    2.9868063323924363
the commission proposal is , as some of you have said , rather technical .    3.41605298056857
nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective : to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives .    2.3179934545745593
at present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations , depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 january 1988 .    2.356161322377996
the purpose of the commission ' s proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists .    3.467027061788237
the scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited .    3.3755017050188476
five amendments have been presented by parliament .    3.3725559905766875
i regret that the commission is not in a position to accept these amendments , despite the fact that i am fully aware of the views and commitment of parliament , the agricultural committee and , in particular , the rapporteur , mr graefe zu baringdorf , on these issues .    3.718981895806218
i shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately .    2.9610803985111764
the first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing article 37 with article 152 .    2.6247239025995763
i would simply point out that the commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection .    3.1847053855062537
the proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health .    2.5133460397675016
i note that parliament ' s committee on legal affairs and the internal market also accepts that article 37 is the appropriate legal base .    2.5467856200940284
i remind parliament that in article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health .    2.743893076690076
amendments nos 2 and 3 go much further than the commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives .    2.507770074449541
i am the first to accept that gmos are a very important issue .    3.034509430448408
i also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update eu legislation in the field of gmos are necessary .    2.872598387737335
however , this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives .    2.731099665859884
the commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by directive 70 / 524 on genetically modified additives at this stage .    2.871095789071421
instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to directive 90 / 220 , which is currently in second reading in parliament .    3.1411598422122102
the commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by parliament in its amendments .    2.44299686234065
i can also assure parliament that i will ensure that the UNK provisions of directive 90 / 220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of directive 70 / 524 that the commission has proposed in the white paper on food safety to present to parliament before july 2001 .    3.03531398823916
i can also assure parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account .    2.2791894519881915
amendments nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give UNK preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted .    1.8568405896520181
the commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations .    1.9272155973962484
i should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate .    3.154333245239171
first of all , regarding the observations made by mr graefe zu baringdorf , i wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of gmo additives in the additives directive 70 / 524 , and not in the novel feed directive .    2.7243101580189606
this is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives .    2.242786267476956
the text taken by parliament is from the directive which was adopted in 1998 .    2.750471436524678
but the vertical legislation in directive 90 / 220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of gmos has changed since then and is still changing .    2.344870265534158
it is before parliament for second reading .    2.7244130993986655
it is my belief that we should await the final outcome of directive 90 / 220 and in particular , article 11 .    2.8996956188164367
reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies .    3.371657713573644
mr kindermann and mrs auroi made reference to this .    2.618827233527765
there are just a few points i should like to make on that issue .    3.520700071843929
first of all , this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993 , so it has not really been UNK on any other commodity producers .    2.6885229450924806
indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product .    2.444091718430028
i should also stress that the commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for gmos to be included in additives .    2.7337865028550765
mrs roth - behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base , whether it should be article 37 or article 152 .    3.1377987588444842
i again refer to what i said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the house that it would be entirely inappropriate for the commission to seek to justify any measure based on article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health .    2.7967434610496498
this is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the european court of justice , which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation .    2.7867957051646193
the UNK of the court appears to be quite clear in relation to this .    3.577968359822592
as an overall comment to the suggested amendments here , particularly in relation to the legal base issue , it would be inappropriate , in my opinion , to change the legal base to article 152 in these circumstances , as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the court .    3.349707554488902
a number of you made reference - mr UNK in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling .    2.985436692799013
directive 70 / 524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives .    2.475745385951539
it is already included now : " indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products " .    2.590599329398342
so this issue will be addressed .    3.032445556390633
that formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product , the subject matter of the application .    2.8176167408314208
mr president , allow me to ask the commissioner one more question .    2.6536896327204698
first allow me to point out , commissioner byrne , that the european parliament has no right of legislative initiative .    3.7114841157207508
but we do reserve the right , when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation , to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out .    2.8256676117127935
for example , you did not go into antibiotics .    3.135526728692781
my question , commissioner byrne is this : the un conference in montreal decided that genetically - modified organisms must be labelled for international trade .    2.2972569337961124
do you really believe that , if we could , parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the european union ?    3.1784754275486407
commissioner byrne , it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with parliament .    2.9038738325357585
we negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years .    2.4316136521207716
i look forward to the next round .    3.225407569079059
. i would stress that no gmos have been approved under this directive ; it applies only to additives .    2.4886629745311653
i would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue .    3.2129659554621375
it is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way , particularly in directive 90 / 220 .    2.9847129346581522
this issue is before parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it , which will also come under the legal base of article 152 which gives parliament full competence in the areas of codecision .    3.0252992603694557
i would assure mr graefe zu baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with parliament on this issue .    2.5228374788884347
the best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before parliament at the moment , as well as the legislation in the pipeline , rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in directive 90 / 220 may not be fully taken into account .    2.7366038224996667
it is best to wait for that debate which , i understand , will take place fairly soon .    3.2058017054080152
all of these matters will be addressed in that legislation .    2.856361859510168
thank you , commissioner .    2.120450226877885
parliament has taken due note of your comments .    3.0349634786464206
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 30 a . m .    1.7247001005060476
scrapie    4.482278344181578
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it was and always will be one of life ' s UNK , one of the UNK UNK of the follow - up to the bse crisis , that we still have no community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep .    3.3514516599304076
in this respect , the commission ' s proposals to amend directive 91 / 68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by mrs roth - behrendt on the detection and control of tse UNK in general , comply with parliament ' s demands in the wake of the follow - up report by the bse committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this .    2.548462013986949
i should , however , like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them bse - infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is UNK from the symptoms of scrapie .    2.267764080487146
no new knowledge was needed , because the theory from the beginning was that bse and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold .    2.180977784812848
from this point of view we are slightly behind the times .    2.485926433642408
i am therefore in complete agreement with the commission ' s proposal on scrapie .    3.079418547171274
i should , however , like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new tse regulation allows a reasonable UNK between consumer protection and practicable suggestions .    2.7950180181291406
we therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the tse proposal , and that of course includes scrapie .    3.2221149574451307
when we discuss the tse regulation , commissioner , we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation , such as UNK , UNK products or animal feed .    2.8291137747779893
we insist on this .    2.802245202212795
as far as i am concerned , that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here .    2.417446075648888
it also means that , when we are fighting these diseases , the problem of destroying whole UNK in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or bse and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda .    2.739334939481685
although i welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the tse regulation , i feel that the commission ' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and i shall submit amendments on behalf of the committee for agriculture and rural development to tighten up the proposals when the roth - behrendt report is debated .    3.036902686712006
i should also like to address two other points . we expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of member states as regards outbreaks of scrapie or tses .    2.458604164658175
here again the commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by parliament .    3.276861472741773
finally , in discussing the question of the future application of tests , we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable .    3.1038799551787446
but the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy , albeit not for every individual animal .    2.109360718302468
i would be grateful , commissioner , if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against tses and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points .    3.3200013556616943
mr president , over the years , the following situation has arisen : one subject has developed into a subject of many facets .    2.3604809292799103
many of us here in this house have spent years , whether we intended to or not , dealing solely with the consequences of the bse scandal right down to the last detail .    2.874311831173785
and it is still on the agenda today .    4.006575295139954
it is therefore hardly surprising that i and mr böge are talking about it and that mr graefe zu baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report .    2.4417568191940062
the cast is always the same .    2.868728226109423
although the cause was unfortunate , it was certainly not the worst experience of this parliament .    2.810428102523902
my task as draftsman of the opinion of the environment committee is a very simple one .    3.326947376473282
i agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the environment committee has asked the committee on agriculture and rural development to agree to the commission proposal .    3.577550897285533
that saves a great deal of time which i would like to use for other things and which i shall use now somewhat in anticipation , as mr böge has just done .    2.917160621805784
i have yet to submit my report on tses to the house .    2.536984840919759
at first we were somewhat UNK and we regret that now .    2.567046969363407
but i have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing .    3.4222795068110208
this debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity , mr byrne , to give the commission a few things to think about .    3.0716997643791055
although we did not have a very positive exchange on mr graefe zu baringdorf ' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree , things may be different with this report .    2.9444275682688326
allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which mr böge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees , with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa , worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple .    2.5959946027826333
it will become more difficult once we see the tse proposal , mr byrne .    2.5633762336807515
when we have the chance to ask direct questions , the questions which mr böge referred to will be asked .    2.632950453953931
questions will be asked - questions which i shall have to put to you and the commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the bse status of the member states and other third countries .    3.0654100713879266
how will bse status in fact be defined then ?    2.4639128386016615
do you envisage circumstances under which the bse status will depend on the willingness to apply a bse test ?    2.4234570488188765
and then there is my standing question to you mr byrne , a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you . what about the bse test ?    2.444533836354414
when will you make it compulsory ?    2.780216407938916
not that i want to put it off , but it would be a gesture , as it were , if you could say : here is the proposed legislation on the bse test .    3.5776374197960266
i say quite emphatically , even after the report by mr graefe zu baringdorf , who is completely involved in the whole idea , that animal feeding , animal UNK , animal production must be suited to the species and must also , above all , cause no harm or danger to human beings .    2.4194285525655386
UNK , medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous .    2.352819753717571
that is , without doubt , too short , too UNK and too little .    2.7859674049604597
you are lucky that mr böge ' s report only deals with this on the sidelines ; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so .    2.47618611803354
finally , just one more brief comment , mr byrne .    2.529184443703666
we have a new commission .    3.3090082199720916
whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this commission and the president of the commission , only time will tell .    3.4024238992865494
but there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and i am sure that , as a lawyer and politician you will understand this . important issues cannot be regulated in annexes .    2.766294788806985
they belong in the legislative text . i might do the same if i were a commissioner , because i could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and i would not always need to work with parliament , which takes so long and is so difficult .    2.7359030263741704
but you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this .    2.9085151372988136
in other words , whenever i get the chance , i shall take everything out of the annexes and UNK it into the legislative text .    2.6620160562927335
and you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset .    3.0234219127234074
mr president , commissioner , i should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe , healthy food which is produced , as a matter of principle , without any questionable or risky interim or end products .    2.280609683743878
over recent years , these basic principles have often been UNK in animal UNK and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or UNK .    2.269533238626375
the european parliament has already taken a clear stand on bse and i think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals .    2.861980745484043
we should not allow food safety to be compromised because , in the final analysis , it is our health which is at stake .    3.0995333806428507
the commission ' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a community regulation to fight scrapie .    2.11348368854809
this is even more important given that there is no clear proof that bse and scrapie are unrelated .    2.6710083409588328
animals are bought throughout europe and transported over the entire continent .    2.414762739282324
the spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers .    2.3521714368875317
and i should point out that , for the first time in history , a case of scrapie was detected in austria about four weeks ago .    2.9471204600377723
scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the UNK can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food .    2.186718554145723
the disease is always fatal .    2.717682305469164
as there is no vaccination , farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie .    2.436670340077416
even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings , the connection with bse has still not been clarified , as i have already said .    2.5928841012502355
as a farmer myself , i am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk .    3.250802241189333
i am in favour of preventive measures , starting with feeding which is suitable for the species , rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out .    2.3449439855069283
i therefore welcome the commission ' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie .    3.175501230514533
mr böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee , and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the bse committee in the committee on agriculture and rural development has fallen to him : he is the one with the experience .    2.988117499706444
i would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the commission ' s proposal .    2.930713830377332
i do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when mrs roth - behrendt ' s report from the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy is featured in the plenary session .    2.3171966002428217
in the previous speech mrs UNK said that UNK is an insidious disease .    2.5968473716380838
it is indeed .    2.895464805664346
for me as a UNK , and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals , it is most important that those eu states where tses do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals .    2.8821512574700923
i wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease .    2.986658047160922
the inspections must be seen as being fair and cost - effective action to promote the UNK of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the eu .    2.8987864169193305
on behalf of the european liberal democrats , we can support the commission ' s proposal on mr böge ' s report , but in the forthcoming debate on mrs roth - behrendt ' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where tses do not occur .    3.2963308312073134
mr president , i too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur .    2.651738017473873
there is no doubt that mr böge and the rapporteur for the committee on the environment are now tremendous experts in this field .    2.7787812916444263
it is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of parliament because it is extremely important .    3.616630976603641
regardless of the many other concerns we may have , bse has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved .    2.8200359289269548
it is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem .    2.532207554605128
i welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will , i hope , address this situation .    2.671330108441073
no - one would want to see what happened to farmers with bse happen ever again .    2.546469881951959
we have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work .    3.7146530619240528
it is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it .    2.5603627188491447
bse has certainly not gone away .    2.6057752706106343
you can see it in different countries .    2.941133454813003
i do not want to point the finger at any particular country , but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the united kingdom .    2.466739356564794
it will be there for some time to come .    3.357300339744089
we have to ensure that the whole system of traceability , of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain , is part of that confidence - building mechanism .    2.4452986983507627
if we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future .    3.0283545596868677
finally , i have certainly believed for a long time , coming from an agricultural background myself , that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal UNK had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had bse in the first place .    2.523112871949713
it was never the responsibility of the farmer , it was the food UNK who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again .    3.0832478424617924
. mr president , i am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between parliament and the commission , namely combating tses .    3.48270030415306
i should also like to thank mr böge for his work on this issue .    2.671225128512096
considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a european parliament and council regulation under article 152 of the treaty on the prevention and control of tses .    2.886571913749963
this proposal addresses all tse risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain .    2.1531190031147935
i am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive community system for the control of these diseases .    2.8037762583465993
i have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation .    2.4434839719587176
the detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal .    2.298516140835306
i have been informed that you welcome this initiative , as appears from your contributions this afternoon , to formulate a single text .    2.268326572606901
i am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation , especially after the reference made by mrs roth - behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue .    2.2064104714843573
i look forward to receipt of that document , which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue .    2.8662319992325207
finally , i would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions , speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation .    2.304398220742925
in the months i have been commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system , i can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve , that is , the translation of policy into legislation .    3.1507545820786365
thank you , commissioner .    2.120450226877885
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 30 a . m .    1.7247001005060476
community policy in the field of water    3.675155132060727
the next item is the recommendation for second reading ( a5 - 0027 / 2000 ) on the common position adopted by the council with a view to the adoption of a european parliament and council directive on establishing a framework for community action in the field of water policy ( UNK / 3 / 1999 - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1997 / UNK ( cod ) ( rapporteur : mrs lienemann ) .    2.5702872915291164
- ( fr ) mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty - first century .    2.631764940162337
climate change , global resources , river quality and groundwater UNK quality are major challenges which threaten our common future .    2.0304818001471037
we will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet ' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions , the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even , more fundamentally , the global balance .    2.390246275913308
to support this statement , i would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague , UNK soares , in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans .    3.408649940093117
when talking about climate change , we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere .    3.2945618407003345
yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet .    2.516411120450781
europe must therefore lead by example to some extent , both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters , including its groundwater , surface waters and seas .    2.304374963395118
furthermore , europe has signed international conventions , in particular the ospar convention in which it made certain commitments .    3.0805143972933022
in this it said that in a few years ' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances .    2.698103044914638
despite having signed these international agreements , this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened .    2.5107530420581283
this is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy , the european parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives , particularly with regard to respect for ospar . this convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action .    2.9953088470710445
the european union ' s water policy is not starting from zero .    2.7935083466194737
many directives have already been adopted . furthermore , the commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives .    3.0753696775483395
the preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation .    2.7724063021981795
however , at first reading this house insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made , like ospar , but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs .    2.9025277826340963
for despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection , when we look at the state of the environment in europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved .    3.6724065310074208
in many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts .    2.532524096121404
we must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us .    2.87932329038672
yet we do not have much time .    3.07101877040622
we could , as the commission has proposed , accept these UNK deadlines which the commission and the council have extended even further . yet if we do , we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public , but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again .    3.157275418528039
i am stressing this point because , when disasters are being reported daily in the news , we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that europe did not act when it should have done . then , in our haste , we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time .    2.3621777782412057
the current example of the danube and the pollution from UNK shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development , clear requirements , controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers , this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time .    2.4982846119718194
it is also clear that if we do nothing , our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner .    3.0529880343237665
even now , the rivers in brittany are UNK and this is damaging tourism .    3.15620831719687
to conclude , the issues are clear at this second reading .    2.5800481503156867
do we or do we not want standards compatible with ospar , in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero ?    2.334128697369563
do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water ?    2.7680253718892542
do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples ?    2.489513175484743
the majority of the amendments approved by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection meet these objectives . i hope they will be supported by this house .    3.0468264687440314
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mrs lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us , especially as the very source of life for human beings .    2.296392057274751
the problem is one of both water quality and water resources , of which there is not a UNK supply everywhere in europe , especially in very dry regions .    3.448485989023539
i am sorry that commissioner wallström , who is responsible in this area , cannot be here now because this is , after all , a very , very important directive on which the commission has been working for a long time , and water protection legislation , which we are debating now at second reading , affects all the citizens of the european union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join , who will have to comply with eu legislation once they UNK .    3.462013340806077
we have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy in 1994 .    2.451645607597144
a great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous members of the european parliament , the european commission and the council of ministers .    3.135962891505726
we reduced the UNK proposed amendments in the environment committee to 77 , but another 30 have been added .    2.3658159931686726
you see , there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different .    3.266416868649423
some want tighter legislation , some want more clarification , others want to serve national interests .    2.0935361124469063
even within my group , the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , there were , of course , differences of opinion .    2.762838247276248
our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions .    2.5905278844190787
in this sense , the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position .    2.9139904230114473
some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the european parliament ' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the council of ministers .    3.194721729033102
we obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the european parliament ' s credibility .    2.8881924369895247
for me , that includes the zero demand , i . e . the demand for zero inputs up to 2020 .    2.6110721657829226
that would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings .    2.091981689949379
i should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and european water protection laws , however UNK they are and however little they are complied with in the member states .    2.424700590862352
i only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the rhine , which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the UNK , which was particularly polluted .    2.9050099578723074
that does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money .    2.9780981322562985
you can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water .    2.5833038428897286
the line followed by our group for the negotiations with the council of ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too .    2.692505827805305
i am horrified that both members of parliament and the public have been UNK by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter .    2.724321090788995
i also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur , mrs lienemann , for all her work and her cooperative attitude , even if we have agreed to differ on certain points .    2.555752541865535
and i also thank the representatives of the european commission , who stood by with advice and expert help at all times .    2.7882017912462267
if the representatives of the council of ministers take an equally constructive approach , then i have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in europe under the conciliation procedure .    2.960675295795542
mr president , i would firstly like to congratulate mrs lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water .    2.6148919673454234
the framework directive on water is a necessary initiative .    3.0029063744710016
nevertheless , given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of european construction , this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion .    3.4524103105838964
nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us .    2.8787544479781766
however , in spain and the other southern countries , which have an unusual climate , the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures .    2.8384315412691876
therefore , we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and , to this end , i ask that you support amendment no 95 , which has been presented by our group .    3.103000782613181
we wish to ensure that article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable , efficient , fair and UNK use of water .    3.0265072699168725
one example is water transfers .    2.5285067337023683
we would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to community supervision .    2.412367658048869
we consider that , given the hydrological characteristics of spain , where transfers of a structural nature are carried out , the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources , and these decisions should , of course , always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water .    3.0677003603563837
with regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate , the application of tariffs , the spanish socialists have been arguing , in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay , that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption .    2.8224356223323834
in spain , a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of europe .    3.044811778979421
the spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses , owing to the scarcity of water resources and the UNK of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive .    3.204750224631902
we have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs . this system should take good account of social , environmental and economic effects , and its implementation should be UNK in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions .    2.262555008856705
however , an environmental europe cannot , in any circumstances , be built at different speeds , but must be built from a point of view of solidarity .    2.5558156317625023
mr president , the ecological disaster in the danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of europe are and how important water is to us all .    2.7330509160502103
discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north - west of england will end up on the beaches of mainland europe .    2.4386865071985673
this brings home the connections which bind us together .    2.1828295088547005
this framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details .    2.7272823599935547
it is important for us to remember that this is a framework .    4.033789939836523
these brushstrokes are indeed very broad .    2.4963237389287425
it is easy for individual countries , for individual sectors of industry , to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days .    2.566040715484174
there are many opportunities to hide .    2.775162267656422
the reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in UNK directives in months and years to come .    2.828693029293897
that is the time to debate some of these problems of detail .    2.916648365658156
the broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater , the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals , which we all need in society in all circumstances , should not be finding their way into our water system .    2.903925604108662
there is a chemical factory in the north - west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation .    3.315733929948933
i would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not UNK to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing .    2.8837995176903455
this is something that they prefer to avoid doing .    2.606396985953817
the principle also concerns water UNK .    2.494498193080181
the basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation , to use the UNK - and - stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water .    2.740870902403622
i want to refer to the political position here .    2.981836594676449
the common position has weakened the stand taken by parliament at first reading .    2.4353779693754243
some of the ngos would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless .    3.2078103986285393
it is a retrograde step .    2.9288425761000623
this is an opportunity for us to improve the situation .    3.60269819966424
we need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation .    2.71300402845091
we have seen vote after vote lost .    2.4930214115658513
measure after measure has come out of the environment committee .    3.4085541296632096
we have failed to achieve a qualified majority .    3.189322684953079
our attempt to improve the environment of europe has failed .    2.814087660469725
we need to get into that conciliation position .    2.525898550333637
we need , at the end of the day , to ensure that we end up with a sensible , balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost .    2.7578343209664538
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as long as nearly thirty years ago , the european commission made attempts to draw up a european water policy .    2.766925625959343
a hundred and twenty - nine chemical substances had to be regulated .    2.4124559191052666
eventually , standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances .    2.231916608183769
the unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle .    2.5649797409804296
the conservative government leaders messrs major and UNK decided in a UNK UNK UNK at the edinburgh summit that it was totally unnecessary for the spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the UNK or english .    2.8166145153882165
this UNK is partly reflected in the common position which came about under british socialist presidency .    2.659360021374927
that position is like UNK UNK , or to keep it the sphere of water , as UNK as a sieve .    3.6521283406045453
it explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the committee on the environment : nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading .    2.536870271371303
this is unusual , but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes .    2.338384993216218
the dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak .    2.520760439684371
the chemical industry and , unfortunately , the european commission and the council of ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance .    2.91818836811685
this is very time - consuming , and , more importantly , there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances .    3.042232644698986
only the background level of the ocean is acceptable .    2.676682339703345
this is what is meant by the term " close - to - zero " .    2.494804422633834
the commission already has a list of 32 priority substances , many of which have a hormone - deregulating effect .    2.746005432073046
this is why it is so important that the european parliament UNK itself openly in favour of the ospar objective of close - to - zero by the year 2020 .    2.904391061296494
i would like to mention two substances from the commission ' s list : mercury and UNK , UNK to tbt .    3.142689838190673
on the bottom of the UNK sea , the values of mercury and tbt are higher than the ospar value , to wit , ten and one thousand times , respectively .    2.362405391811271
the chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by UNK UNK , and if this is impossible , to apply them in closed systems .    2.777518944959856
for the substance tbt , this means that it can no longer be used as an anti - UNK substance .    3.318048391624767
a sound alternative would be to clean the ship ' s sides UNK .    2.6428935163181664
i would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the european parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close - to - zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone - deregulating substances by the year 2020 .    2.3599181487829046
mr president , the european parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the water directive .    3.2055134064430453
the council ' s common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas .    3.0644738893600834
therefore , our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete .    2.9187270913829297
as members of the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left , we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals .    2.4374272669062313
firstly , we think that the time - frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the council .    3.0916169586591007
we therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive .    3.198667597150863
there should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented .    2.279037078723455
the legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions , such as the ospar convention must be respected .    3.42084238349752
this means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used .    2.848388704069748
nowadays , taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming .    2.2048411699273105
the obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay , although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases .    2.1379895204181323
fourthly , we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined .    2.7588751385546044
fifthly , the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear .    2.4795403306510098
against that background , our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by mrs lienemann , the rapporteur , as adopted in committee .    3.6875020177199525
we should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended .    3.796385900625685
we will therefore vote for the greens ' amendments nos 102 , 103 and 104 , which we consider to be improvements on the present position .    2.577090604545928
as regards pricing policy , there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report .    2.5408282852403024
my own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in amendment no 43 , tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the greens ' amendment no 105 .    2.7438577519807303
i cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned .    2.264612357909773
however , some people in our political group think otherwise .    2.450844276558947
consequently , amendment no 107 , on the same question , has been tabled by one section of our group only .    3.6033050315693855
on the whole , i welcome the committee ' s proposals set out in mrs lienemann ' s report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard - won compromise .    3.0700963221861453
mr president , every satellite UNK proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet , yet the UNK of water is an illusion .    2.739644370977623
the recent disaster on the danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the UNK of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders .    2.5418041944905885
water is a renewable but limited natural resource .    2.2966282118984584
it becomes UNK when it is UNK and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable .    3.037484028255118
in the eu , this is a crucial issue in the mediterranean region and also in other european countries where we are witnessing the gradual UNK of wet areas .    3.57140664640597
the increase in vulnerable areas , both wet and dry , inequalities between countries , inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic , economic , geographical and UNK events are all the evidence we need . however , these must not lead to competition distortions within the community .    2.299710434204939
we have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water , given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land .    3.133173877405326
agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive .    2.906097587905814
it is not only in the member states that solutions to these problems are being sought . last october in UNK , the countries in the euro - mediterranean partnership UNK demanded a marshall plan for water for the south coast of the mediterranean .    2.97729556068712
however , we are in europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods , which the directive underlines .    2.584173717493827
for example , france , the rhine valley and central europe recently suffered flooding .    2.2632635161479695
we need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other .    2.4334656784814928
yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water .    2.649928575740577
the water issue will definitely not be settled today .    2.5885988456295985
in fact , the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects .    2.8269815426782614
this is enough reason to thank mrs lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water .    2.4889664629253616
it seems rather complicated to attain a proper european legislative framework .    2.1353079989632127
with the framework directive on water policy , we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the eu ' s water legislation .    3.4276530186440866
but that has not UNK us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies .    2.5316384018833196
more specifically , the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by member states and water UNK , which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach , need to be UNK .    3.26458573227866
the key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water , the protection of eco systems , the promotion of the sustainable use of water , the control of floods and droughts and the UNK of discharging dangerous substances into surface water .    2.6821624849526544
as far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned , i am of the opinion that the councils ' objectives lack both commitment and ambition .    2.473339797752033
the committee on the environment ' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close - to - zero is , in my view , to be welcomed and worthy of UNK .    3.05683683022686
however , a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability .    2.78635042403335
consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced , as well as UNK emissions which are difficult to control , and which pollute the water quite substantially .    2.6749900432227403
mr president , we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect .    3.109250931129564
in the 20th century , water was merely a free UNK and disposal system for poisonous substances , special waste , chemicals and so on . and we can already see the consequences !    2.1836915119804416
we need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation .    2.252135692757674
the directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the commission is planning here .    2.8702477587208204
in the final analysis , water protection is not just a social question , it is a decisive social question , which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences .    3.083493410982911
given the advanced state of pollution of water resources , it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements .    2.754652702724276
mr president , it must be some six years ago now that mr karl - heinz florenz , assisted by mrs UNK schleicher , put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety .    2.2610720124723676
it is not an easy topic and , in my opinion , the efforts made by mrs lienemann are very laudable indeed .    2.9718812098982754
the topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result , we have been able to draft important , more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading .    2.853724648316756
in fact , the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal .    2.8884268200718894
it is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge .    2.7152764626289296
i would also address the spanish member in this respect : in the north of europe , we often face floods , but also polluted water , from industry , whilst the problem facing the members in the south is often related to transporting water over long distances , simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture .    2.556649583591095
i would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail .    2.447096938594998
i would first of all like to focus on quality .    2.961136834812891
the netherlands is significantly affected by the european water policy .    3.222488043488692
a very important component , to wit , one third of our drinking water , is UNK from surface water in the netherlands .    2.909058710559754
the netherlands is located downstream , in a delta , which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance .    2.625461458549212
another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality .    2.4305823145683485
in a number of amendments , the proposed standards and especially the ospar standard for 2020 are called into question .    2.6523168157969073
although i understand that , according to some , this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially , i do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure .    3.100067727104508
i would now like to say a few words on quantity management .    2.507208528812996
in his UNK " UNK UNK holland " [ " UNK about holland " ] , a famous dutch poet mentioned water too , which , with its never - ending trail of destruction , was feared and respected .    2.1696347059460694
in UNK , we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology .    3.1099749610593315
when our rivers flooded in 1990 , we established that UNK artificial works upstream affects the water - storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage .    2.0425008290754696
this means that in terms of quantity management too , we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it .    2.9472808047232557
mr president , i too would like to start by congratulating mrs lienemann on her excellent work .    2.208133915626904
water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right .    3.0058368791920653
everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self - evident , as many have experienced in southern europe and are experiencing now in the danube countries too .    2.6279149142134806
water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples .    2.5582837409443004
this is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination .    2.3961279712789305
we need to recognise that water is a joint liability .    3.368430032412045
cooperation within a catchment basin must be self - evident .    2.420131232388218
too little operational capacity upstream or , in fact , excessive use , can cause problems downstream .    2.549309165413277
coordination is the key word here .    3.0161524251847593
the problem of water is becoming increasingly topical .    3.144319968985547
changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on UNK .    2.4946981902523664
some areas are becoming UNK , whilst many are becoming UNK .    2.484953380261515
it is time for action .    2.8249067066689135
in march , the second world water forum will be held in the hague .    2.926249428894212
this forum stands for a worldwide vision .    2.42679847168864
this vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control .    2.1882993710788496
the time for action is upon us .    2.7360835883920163
the european parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time .    2.4639190024578936
but we should not lower our standards too much either .    2.553913550573188
the common position is not ambitious enough .    2.856272111435707
this is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements , or the ospar objectives .    2.794190879551519
we need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020 .    2.3449993780636187
this has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too .    2.9249837186249636
the ospar objectives are now being drawn up .    3.0684309290211553
a list has been compiled , containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment .    2.152761649592983
it is both technically and economically possible to reduce the UNK of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again .    2.9266390582223014
needless to say , the directive also needs to be binding .    3.2286116372718396
countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives .    3.204818773340406
quality has a price , but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future .    2.36064213754047
mr president , commissioner , my compliments to mrs lienemann on her excellent work on the water directive .    2.480127487795522
i should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change , the depletion of UNK forests and overfishing , constantly affect our common and vital but , in some ways , UNK resources .    2.4071790982783132
we should also recognise that , in europe , our fresh water sources may be said to be on the UNK between being owned by everyone and by no - one .    3.071079039026223
it is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established .    2.3409860900645394
it is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are , irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common UNK .    2.2321474449742977
ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive does indeed , as many speakers have already said , represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the UNK of piecemeal eu regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in europe .    2.785249695834906
however , i have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation .    3.089897446212211
i also hope that the vote will not be a UNK and that will depend on what i see as two quite fundamental points .    3.6560523823007802
first ospar .    3.107871053886475
we know that the commission proposal does not go far enough ; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the committee on the environment .    3.22888291384189
merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough .    2.935060572164562
what we need is a completely legally binding objective for ospar .    2.3091562370174614
only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and , more importantly , objectives which are enforceable under the law .    2.455194346733926
anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters , such as those which have just come to light in romania and hungary , from happening to us .    2.5360606531344674
i find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection , despite having agreed internationally on ospar .    2.271734206330595
but i think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in parliament , in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised .    4.222222998793112
it is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth .    2.2653628470848113
we must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry UNK ; on the contrary , we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and , hence , cost - covering prices .    2.5174931667883587
water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the ospar convention .    2.7981241056648445
with closed production UNK this is possible ; anything else would water down the directive .    2.2280885179997396
let us UNK our chance .    2.599856214953538
mr president , in the small amount of time allotted to me , i would like to welcome the mrs lienemann ' s report and remind the house of three principles , to which all other principles must be subordinate , which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur ' s amendments : water is not a commercial product , but the property of all the peoples of the union ; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater , and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity .    3.2310685047936314
i know that this directive may have problems , given the differing situations of the various countries of the union , as has already been mentioned .    3.5115157268324433
the situation in the north is different from that in the south , and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas .    3.780982118513794
i understand this .    3.0466787439201166
however , there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south , specifically amendment no 43 which , with regard to the recuperation of costs , also indicates that member states must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making .    3.2177967989518175
in my country - i live in the north of spain - , there is a considerable difference between the north and the south , and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another .    3.071273054788329
however , mrs lienemann ' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water .    2.4217930947873523
i know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties , but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the danube and what happened in doñana .    3.024335453453561
we cannot allow our european water to be polluted , mr president , and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water , which is so precious to all of us .    3.2887906603903923
mr president , my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report .    2.5846589642278635
as an irish member of the european parliament , coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water , i support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive .    3.150317480563144
however , i would now like to look at the areas of difference between parliament ' s committee on the environment and the council .    3.4801755536102292
the latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter .    2.6417209669617407
according to the council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force , whereas parliament ' s committee on the environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years .    2.8032841111653726
i see no reason why european union member states cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible .    2.6365642228018906
i now turn to the amendments to be tabled before parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage .    2.670740321071944
the council in its common position states that the european union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage .    3.7417830192690493
no specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position .    3.225719051365242
amendment no 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently .    2.663289564228149
moreover , an adequate contribution from different economic sectors , broken down into industrial , household and agricultural sectors , must ensure that this policy is implemented .    2.2730929833976563
unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that UNK and water rates should be implemented for UNK right across the european union states .    2.6088994065163607
this is politically UNK from an irish perspective , as indeed it would be from the perspective of other eu member states such as portugal , greece and spain .    2.650641597596495
mr president , i want first of all to say thank you to mrs lienemann for her report .    2.65393532383128
it is here and now that we decide to what extent the eu countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come .    2.8540322629506485
we can do this by , as a parliament , amending the council ' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment .    2.9536252759373447
in its UNK form , the present directive could , in fact , have very unfortunate and long - term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water .    3.2606864069397994
it would be to send out the wrong signals both to european industry and to the european people .    3.51367857939279
it is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters .    2.2393285261213
the directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100 , 000 chemicals in circulation .    2.403059353983057
we cannot afford to wait .    2.7151337838474854
in this connection , i would ask parliament to support amendment no 108 , in which the words " water pollution caused by individual pollutants " are replaced by " prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges " .    2.4304943293597407
we cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment .    2.02033951274009
the eu ' s ministers for the environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the ospar convention , which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment .    2.5385882451880266
mr president , it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive .    2.619266305795903
the treaty of amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention , for the implementation of the ' polluter pays ' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment .    2.7419015126762245
clearly , the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non - polluting systems , seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage , particularly our water resources .    2.378056124242957
this situation is UNK echoed in many sectors of the economy , and especially in the agricultural sector .    3.171705227445313
the concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture , environment and water resources , and between positive and negative effects , and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on . this concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that UNK basic standards , along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income .    2.337353426236383
the obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration UNK from this notion , with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions .    2.915365605722354
we must not , with this in mind , pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting , improving and restoring their quality , as this would create a UNK hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques .    2.43593877289264
as regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment , an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and community levels , which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities .    2.1560341699961816
finally , we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances , using the increased information available on their chemical , physical and biological UNK , in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage , which is fundamental to us all .    2.586092574157152
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the treaty of amsterdam seriously , then our long - term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption .    2.677166108038197
we can achieve this long - term objective by developing measures with demanding standards .    2.5523365817404984
in this respect , i fully support the amendments proposed by mrs lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that , when people use water , they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks .    2.6827075953798287
this directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting .    2.719041899487602
first there is wide information for and involvement by the public , a UNK in a european directive .    3.212673222191899
secondly , there is compulsory cooperation .    3.3594289752087296
i am glad a UNK approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality .    2.883754471598243
thirdly , i should like to address the question of the timetable .    3.631921070013291
i am firmly convinced that we need a strict , tight timetable in order to work towards our long - term objective .    3.1195739746327673
compare it with what happens in december .    2.940574556862349
we all know in december that christmas eve falls on UNK december and we start buying presents .    2.0565455445486167
but what would we do if we knew in december that christmas was in thirty years ' time .    2.1462754565118636
we all know what we would do , which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy .    3.161685422743726
i emphatically support the rapporteur ' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive , from the list of measures to the question of employment measures .    3.8044767279450054
may i take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the nitrates directive have still not been implemented in all member states , in spite of the fact that there is a common eu resolution .    3.0320643064378316
the present proposal UNK up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives .    2.9417363923931354
it is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced UNK substances .    2.136560688230045
this cannot be done , and it also , in any case , goes against nature .    3.8451574114312677
adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the eu if concentrations of , for example , UNK and UNK could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for UNK in the aquatic environment .    2.955174997486547
european agriculture would not , for example , be able to grow bread UNK with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread .    3.4377594580260227
as a result , agricultural production would move to other countries outside the eu , with consequent high socio - economic and employment costs .    2.4865112117725467
i cannot vote in favour of the sections in the water framework directive which deal with these states of affairs .    2.55633111008145
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , water is a precious raw material .    2.236072652974172
millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal .    2.4594026676907417
it should , therefore , not surprise us that water is the cause of wars .    3.232367188185054
the capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs .    2.4300588380853467
general interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation .    2.5348850170383854
europe is therefore facing an arduous task ; that of combining a community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation .    2.3302479470342576
i have to admit that in UNK , where i come from , we still have a long way to go too .    3.4429159544066157
we were recently UNK on the UNK by the commission regarding this matter .    3.9414920063742525
anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way .    2.79974284081713
the common position is in this respect a farce , a document with no strings attached and a true UNK in the light of the ospar agreements .    2.8535687777620513
the period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years .    2.3962780177355327
by then , my children will be older than i am now .    2.4027819706934257
you have to admit : this is a UNK .    3.766455692083948
tomorrow , we might opt in favour of a weak and UNK framework which UNK the future of our children .    3.121350560138379
either we opt for the amendments of my group , of the rapporteur or the committee on the environment .    3.5076897268157037
i would like to finish off with this observation .    2.234240638142371
in the past couple of months , we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in belgium .    3.3372962686155523
what was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the council of ministers .    2.561270779491511
in our own country , this pressure was UNK by both flemish and UNK environment administrations .    2.756012389959929
they have opted for the weak common position in favour of our parliament ' s more drastic UNK .    3.204937039060631
i really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green environment ministers in my country are aware .    3.052089571833313
ladies and gentlemen , fine words are no longer sufficient .    2.7552132855713074
we need to change tack completely .    2.610118959171905
during the vote tomorrow , we can make it clear that europe is drafting a responsible and future - orientated water policy .    2.914305549861314
this can only benefit our credibility .    2.7091106918942436
the debate is suspended and will UNK at 9 p . m .    2.120099513101326
the dialogue on europe - institutional reform    2.8171955744452433
the next item is the commission communication - the dialogue on europe - institutional reform : the issues at stake .    2.209148078187872
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today . i am basically here to speak to you , as indicated by your agenda , on a new initiative which the commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform .    2.9266543841657975
this reform must involve all the actors in european construction , with yourselves as meps at the forefront but also myself as a commissioner , the council ministers and national mps . it must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this european construction .    2.522873123984575
this morning , in the lengthy debate which i attended with mr prodi , many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the european institutions .    4.123315905675711
yet it is not just a question of who does what , as one of you said very clearly and forcefully .    3.0423898548526913
ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do .    2.8048853114699486
we must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future , particularly with the countries which will be joining us .    3.9067112033544604
we too are concerned about this lack of democracy , and the commission has therefore decided to launch the ' dialogue on europe ' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people . this initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the intergovernmental conference .    3.383949725294222
during the igc i will have the honour of representing the commission together with mr prodi and of working closely with your two representatives , mr brok and mr tsatsos . all the commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region , and not just their own , which in my case happens three or four times a month , to engage in direct dialogue with the public , and not just with the UNK or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course .    2.6401353953788274
we also plan to establish direct contacts in universities , schools and factories , to meet the people , answer their questions and listen to them . in this way we will play our part , as will you , in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do .    2.48520467279852
we hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the member states and in conjunction with the european parliament .    3.3136335448154455
we will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or UNK the work .    2.6578504755526247
we also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments , local elected representatives , non - governmental organisations , socio - professional organisations and the media .    2.4361404212593034
opinion UNK , political groups and parties , meps and national mps , elected representatives , as i have just said , local authorities or national parliaments , the committee of the regions , the economic and social committee , organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved .    2.7321189327374
need i remind you that the european parliament itself took the initiative on 1 february ? i must again thank mr napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are , of course , the representatives of the people in each member state .    3.0084008821063613
the commission will propose that the member states become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership .    2.896274661898219
we are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the european union presidency and the european parliament .    3.4744169422847566
we want to encourage debate among the people .    2.5916615069095004
without UNK to lecture you - god UNK - or even advise you , may i just point out that , when it was my honour to be minister for european affairs in my own country , i saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people ? each week , when engaging in this dialogue in each region , i realised that there was a real need for the european union to have a face .    3.102492248041864
i therefore took a european commissioner , and not just the french ones , or ambassadors posted in paris or meps to engage in this dialogue each week . this made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected , listened to and informed .    2.2996109866935655
so this is what we are going to do .    3.8753842410327803
we will have a budget of approximately eur 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve .    2.6899491691579986
financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001 . it will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the intergovernmental conference and the ratification process .    2.594192866268361
we will launch this dialogue on 8 march in brussels in the presence of 700 young commission UNK .    2.1758726610253833
your president , mrs fontaine , has agreed to take part with mr prodi and several commissioners in this initial dialogue . i can assure you that , whenever a commissioner intends to engage in dialogue , the most immediately available meps will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the european parliament .    2.9752600713020083
i welcome any questions , suggestions or proposals from the members present .    2.241291517694184
colleagues , you know the rules .    2.9939235343038915
you are expected to ask questions , not necessarily make lengthy statements .    2.5353685610376133
you have one minute each in which to ask your question .    2.4923535987618566
mr president , i think i also speak for the committee on constitutional affairs that i chair , in expressing my appreciation of this commission initiative .    2.5071665250718063
moreover , this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by parliament itself in its resolution of 18 november .    2.688275191890278
i have also heard commissioner barnier ' s clarification of relations and links with the european parliament during the implementation of this programme .    3.043739842472321
if i may make a suggestion , commissioner barnier , would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject , in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the european parliament ?    3.0341716480488254
it would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because i can see a particular problem with coordination , specifically between the commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments , but also members of national parliaments - and our committee ' s programme . following the working meeting of 1 february , which commissioner barnier referred to and which benefited from the UNK contribution of the commission , the committee intends to take stock of developments at the intergovernmental conference at all of its meetings .    2.6691303337581207
we therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings , and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the commission ' s initiative .    2.8883849492665887
thank you , mr napolitano .    2.6364358044206884
i can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 november .    2.7764762883943193
i also want at this stage to say that i was able to propose this initiative to the commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague , UNK reding . this initiative was also established in conjunction with UNK verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement , both its opportunities and risks , and of institutional reform .    2.937852973814387
these challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them .    2.6003770333539578
i will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the commission ' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other . i will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint .    2.92253138612842
you realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned .    2.4078364029076362
mr president , commissioner , it is music to my ears to hear you use the word ' citizen ' so often .    2.175438756393016
we are increasingly concerned in this house about public opinion . the fear of public opinion is a rather UNK concept but our house is what it is and we must do what we can with it .    2.855557295973761
in terms of the igc issue , i have a specific question for you . i believe that the court of justice in luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and olaf .    3.419765073567916
as you know , there are problems which not only concern this house but also the european officials who are also european citizens .    2.582702108002611
given the urgency surrounding this issue , has the commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti - fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud , in the member states and in the european institutions , coming under the jurisdiction of the court of justice ?    3.128605249579762
mr dupuis , first of all i attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word ' citizen ' .    2.5106135831498113
it is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used .    2.9628728806708664
we will conduct this dialogue with our citizens , including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision - making or information centres .    2.914505462174659
with regard to the igc and this issue of the fight against fraud , and specifically fraud against the community budget and interests , we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a european public prosecutor . we have done this in the spirit of this house ' s work and perhaps by going down the same road .    3.2547744055485563
this public prosecutor would have the authority , recognised by the eu treaty and therefore by the member states , to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the community budget and interests .    2.6728870833410934
we can clearly and almost UNK see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it UNK from inside or outside the community . this is why we have proposed the creation of a european public prosecutor who could , having investigated a case from start to finish , then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court .    2.289081142324684
in reply to your second point on the court of justice , we have not yet established our position on the court of justice because we were waiting for the UNK report which was published a few days ago .    3.2024044273686467
the commission , as i have promised , will complete its proposals on the igc opinion about the legal system and the court of justice within the next few weeks .    3.2594919314776223
mr president , mr commissioner , the day before yesterday , there was a leading news item in the most popular danish news programme , which i would ask you to comment on .    3.267852036821278
the story went that an official in the commission had apparently told an austrian UNK that , because he was austrian , he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries , including denmark .    2.5686025287349503
i would ask you to confirm that , if an official has said that an austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects , then this official has got the wrong end of the stick , and that , if he has not said this , then there is no story .    3.0612158655744564
will you confirm what is the case ?    3.7244205826868946
mr haarder , to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing .    2.35457831506044
my personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the austrian people , businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in austria of a new government coalition .    2.6442678320885946
therefore , subject to verification which i or someone else will give immediately after this sitting , i can confirm what you have just said , that the commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort .    2.548220241490475
generally speaking , there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in austria . i have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957 .    2.7441925133464284
this is why we are drawing up a charter of fundamental rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis . this is why we have article 13 of the ec treaty on discrimination which we proposed , in our opinion of 26 january even before the austrian crisis , should be applied after the igc by qualified majority rather than by unanimity .    2.4275376038285508
this is why i personally have an idea to supplement article 7 of the eu treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis . finally , this is why we have public debate .    2.7669483759583273
the only way to eliminate UNK ideas is to offer alternatives , which brings me back to the subject of our discussion . i firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate , particularly to fight against demagoguery .    2.5475773360533154
commissioner barnier , you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of europe .    2.919508190594799
with reference to the igc , as you know , under the helsinki decisions the portuguese presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the igc during the course of the igc .    3.41687169085784
clearly , parliament has its own representatives present , mr brok and mr tsatsos .    2.669260167681723
but would you , commissioner , also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the council you would report this to parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you , with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress ?    3.0660205506733553
mr UNK , my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise .    2.7543345727675628
mr napolitano , the chairman , and many other members of the committee on constitutional affairs and even more meps in this house know that , on behalf of the commission , i will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations , in a spirit of transparency .    3.3134755739036246
i will perhaps say this differently from mr tsatsos and mr brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that , in many cases , we will say this together .    2.7602122443384594
it is very important that these negotiations is not UNK with the european parliament or the national parliaments which , when all said and done , will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process .    2.8454193609145406
this is why i congratulate mr napolitano ' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the fifteen and the european parliament .    2.76964396811866
having said that , the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions .    3.182330304472681
i will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year .    2.830449804622963
mr president , firstly i would like to compliment the commission on its approach .    2.8816784750038202
i think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage . this did not really happen for the treaty of amsterdam or the treaty of maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust .    2.705084761322677
i have two questions . firstly , you mentioned that you will start a two - way dialogue with the citizens and i am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the european commission .    2.977047992732442
do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well , that is to say via the television and internet ?    2.860349102574389
my second question is of a critical nature .    2.521326352173711
the european commission has just issued a proposal on transparency .    2.8945026071666042
if i compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the netherlands , then the european model is UNK overshadowed by the dutch model , and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the netherlands .    2.727226796462955
my question is really : how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the igc , because the present directive is not a good example of this .    3.4222791087599966
mrs maij - weggen , given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the igc , it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now .    3.180629860466382
the group of representatives is currently meeting in brussels and i will try to join them as soon as possible .    2.6568177305026355
the documents will in the main be open working documents .    2.686511487813934
although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the european council will not be open to the media , i am committed , as i must be at this stage , to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate UNK on these negotiations and the commission ' s viewpoint .    3.341843704293581
i can confirm , and thank you for having asked me about this , that we will use all the most modern means , television in particular , to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across europe .    2.7016498021351696
we will open an internet forum and create permanent discussion forums .    2.109785440635836
the commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised .    2.359298896122155
these are the modern means to be used .    3.037795425731743
however , i believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people .    3.2568370862962377
although this may be a rather UNK ideal , i want a commissioner , when he can , an mep , a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of europe .    2.905911609100538
i have evidence that this is possible .    3.459622406216866
the majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions .    2.353084202437227
mr president , i welcome mr barnier ' s commitment to go to the regions , both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say .    2.8578586397749794
i would like to invite him to my own region of yorkshire , a major european region that is a full UNK in the single european market and a major UNK of european structural funding .    2.590418982308007
he can come with both the hats that he UNK as a commissioner .    2.6438754149154384
i would like to ask him how vigorous the commission will be in this information campaign ?    2.93479104640809
in some member states it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be .    3.3473434776217608
that is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti - european movement and anti - european organisations that exist .    2.6926003901755067
the commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign .    3.3254718885872183
mr corbett , thank you for your comments .    2.88559057116833
i willingly accept your invitation . if i have understood you correctly , you want me , when i come to yorkshire , to talk not only about the reform of the european institutions but also the structural funds .    2.6288896113565507
i can perform this dual task .    2.4191722330458685
i forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments , as i have already done , not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in UNK .    2.883982567873005
ten days ago i was in westminster , so you can see , mr corbett , that i am not afraid of the difficulties .    3.1521414098620966
next week i will go to the UNK in berlin .    3.691184127584282
i have already appeared before the french senate .    2.4975414391232023
therefore , throughout this debate , whenever i can , i will go directly to see the national parliaments too .    3.5543931744162265
with regard to the dialogue with our citizens , it is not a question of propaganda or marketing , nor even of communication .    3.1920723317701585
i want this dialogue to be a real dialogue . so , after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform , those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion .    2.6436249192486256
i will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the member states . i sincerely hope , with your support , that the governments of the fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate .    3.069951724497814
it is not much fun , of course , having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself .    2.6100687684416344
in connection with the intergovernmental conference , mr barnier said , during his presentation in parliament , that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision - making but , when i look at page 63 , i see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say , the residence directives - , combating discrimination , the whole of social security and the renewal of regulation no UNK and , with a few exceptions , of arrangements in the socio - political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting .    2.998829754647782
it is , of course , these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the folketing and other parliaments .    2.276903564574017
can such matters be controlled from brussels ?    2.435625980498717
is this an element in the radical decentralisation which mr prodi talked about this morning ?    2.4253423400042013
i was very glad to learn last week that the commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference , not merely to relations between the union and member states , but also the union , the member states , regions and cities .    3.6804218220163287
i hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of europe , commissioner barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears .    2.2534968505079473
commissioner , i want to go back to one of your previous answers . in this you mentioned what i would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the eu treaty against any risks of UNK and , in particular , the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a member state , pursuant to article 7 , for the violation of fundamental freedoms .    3.120764675117283
i do not think so .    2.283480982015855
are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion , unpopular opinions or UNK from the dominant european thinking ?    2.1932425641192066
yes , mr bonde , we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the commission .    3.181187954645884
i believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated .    2.871204366973485
in your country , mr bonde , like everywhere else , i believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the UNK conditions of competition and movement of goods and people .    2.669724427337031
this will therefore be our rule .    3.024066654199546
we are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market . our proposal is not general or systematic .    2.7519348653311244
i am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues .    2.8693043847530038
i do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical .    3.3300727073667282
this has never been the case . we are simply trying to ensure , in a europe with 30 or 27 member states , the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27 .    3.3112122573180933
mr maccormick , i agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals .    2.6408083768908766
it must get as close as possible to the people , where they live and where they have their roots .    2.7735244058292308
if i said anything different i would be UNK myself as commissioner for regional policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions . you will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people , where they live , to preserve their roots , traditions , soul and identity .    2.750624036481638
we will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions .    2.7076079666929527
mr berthu , the helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this .    3.0141761965885228
it specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in amsterdam .    2.780645810008884
it also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the portuguese and french presidencies .    2.718651729064644
the commission is acting correctly if , on a particular point , it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions . i am not yet sure that we will do this on article 7 .    2.818992835793792
however , if we do , this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the union must mobilise together to give their response . we will also do this with regard for the future in general .    2.900430024767198
everything which can be done will be useful . i am sure that you and i , mr berthu , can at least agree on this .    2.9379479389638634
you have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for europe that you referred to .    2.063127975104007
you have set a very good example of time - keeping today .    2.845347962189895
that concludes the debate .    2.231945172538318
question time ( commission )    2.52203753673809
the next item is question time ( b5 - 0009 / 2000 ) . we will examine questions to the commission .    2.213605126893159
first part    3.3318143916855933
question no 36 by ( h - 0025 / 00 ) :    2.2436609735209316
subject : high infant mortality in kosovo according to the latest un data received from the world health organisation , kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in europe ; almost 50 % of babies born prematurely die , while the war has produced a UNK rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm .    2.06756375890413
in the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the union and the efforts of its envoy bernard kouchner , will the commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of kosovo ' s right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women , women in UNK and babies ?    2.8963118253238123
mr president , the commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in kosovo , not just for pregnant women but across the board .    2.7786068568379845
this results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it .    2.2099078732588966
the statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable .    2.3768069600250503
however , the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population .    3.133872821391252
the commission ' s response has been as follows : firstly , the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of echo funding .    2.906954727589538
however , efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self - sufficient healthcare system in the province .    2.4386321043268575
unmik has already taken a significant role in this field .    3.0058740901446606
secondly , under the reconstruction programme , urgent intervention at the hospital in mitrovica has already been initiated with a eur 1 million rehabilitation programme .    2.450228225744592
progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city .    2.758854827441762
however , the commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of unmik for this project .    2.8520062242941018
we hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation .    2.3009134852699513
under the european community ' s damage assessment , estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to UNK and health houses amount to eur 4 million .    2.5027810598564444
the commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds .    2.6512967945649164
we expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system .    2.340124934593585
the emphasis will be on long - term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement .    2.7678943270739476
work is already under way with unmik to determine an appropriate contribution from the commission to this enterprise .    2.8535320189816917
commissioner , this morning president prodi , among others , stressed that the balkans are testing our ability to act effectively , the very credibility of the european union is on trial , and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed .    3.0784091397597795
commissioner , do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in kosovo - the highest in europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in kosovo , are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises ?    2.335411952006661
besides , commissioner , is so - called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in kosovo ?    2.9246016658765854
do you think that so much UNK is UNK when , on the continent of europe itself , the right to life is at risk ?    2.7850504968022682
i do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it , which have been working incredibly hard in kosovo , would regard it as an adequate description of their UNK to suggest that they had been standing UNK by .    2.622152607822809
i am sure the honourable member did not mean that .    3.1108097700794772
of course , she is entirely correct in saying that the union ' s credibility is on the line with what happens , not just in kosovo but in the balkans as a whole .    3.3434289597177598
i am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance .    2.40760429654515
i would just make two points about the situation in kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along who lines .    2.6455999309067377
first of all , i am sure that the honourable member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in belgrade UNK the health service in kosovo , and many albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all .    2.609971043928226
so what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under - investment .    2.96443069184058
secondly , and i am sure that the honourable member recognises this as well , some of the tragic stories to come out of kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child UNK during carriage of a baby , but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born .    2.6497666607374306
those were cases in which women who during the hostilities , or before the hostilities , UNK killed their own children .    2.279001709333376
we are dealing with a UNK story in kosovo .    2.9144162788938077
we have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour , but it is not going to be easy .    2.8704779245324357
however , i still have some contacts in kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by echo , among others , are often of inferior quality .    1.9576475079756868
in some cases , there have been incidents of food containing UNK and such like .    2.6305143382528686
are you aware of this ?    3.20123307618456
are you prepared to act upon it ?    2.6258484251494383
this is my first additional question .    2.6922744690368647
my second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in mitrovica .    2.348037241462217
you are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the northern part of the city and that , given the tense situation , albanian kosovars do not have any access to this section at all .    2.782642411031873
what does the commission intend to do in order to ensure that albanian kosovars too can get to hospital ?    2.940331737051651
on the first question , i am going myself to kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and i will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable member about the echo food package .    2.99829334679426
i have not heard that suggestion before , but it is an important point and i will certainly investigate it when i am there .    3.0507488756905032
secondly , i do understand exactly what the honourable member is saying about mitrovica .    2.7341474301582815
i was in mitrovica a couple of months ago , i saw the situation there for myself .    2.7419718043360772
i had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities , including the leader of the albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently .    2.1695622530011773
so i know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and i can assure the honourable member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in kosovo , whatever ethnic group they come from .    3.16086133793207
the particular difficulties in mitrovica - for example , it is not just a question of albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital , albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems .    2.388405031653685
we will try to address them , but it is not easy .    3.4076184964141456
question no 37 by ( h - 0029 / 00 ) :    2.3181305062301125
subject : turkish blockade of armenia given that the european union is actively promoting social , economic and political relations with armenia through the partnership and cooperation agreement signed on 12 october 1999 , what steps is the commission taking to persuade the turkish government to lift the economic blockade of armenia ?    2.134565399763927
the commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between turkey and armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries .    2.4873619735223227
in the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between armenia and turkey , as well as the one between armenia and UNK could be opened without settlement of the nagorno - karabakh conflict .    2.293462941862687
mr president , the commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of turkey to the european union .    3.088981918364682
will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because , in the final analysis , we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the european union ?    2.912071137984325
the key issue is to support the efforts of the osce UNK group to find a settlement to the nagorno - karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can .    2.5586462895202886
we have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the tacis programme to armenia .    2.274236746491648
let me relate my answer specifically to the question of turkish accession to the european union .    2.5756887606090806
the situation of turkey ' s relations with its neighbours will , as the honourable member asks , be closely examined in the framework of the pre - accession strategy .    2.875970774980706
as stated in agenda 2000 - and i quote : " enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts " .    2.6506408157434667
that statement could not be much clearer .    2.9633223832888067
but i repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results .    3.0208810282390512
question no 38 by ( h - 0040 / 00 ) :    2.2957380821279383
subject : implications for human rights of the construction of the ilisu dam in turkey given that turkey has recently been granted applicant country status , what is the commission ' s view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the ilisu dam , given the massive displacement of the UNK and the other people of the region that will result ?    3.331473770821133
the commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the ilisu dam on the population of the region .    2.8267833110640685
we will , however , consider raising the matter with the turkish authorities , together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre - accession strategy for turkey .    3.2334892694061277
i have a related point .    2.749059781715027
it concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole .    2.87239808033886
as you know , the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to syria and to iraq in particular .    2.201523275252757
given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many UNK that we will see an increased incidence of conflict , of so - called " water wars " , in the coming decades , what is the commission ' s view about the potential destabilisation , both in turkey and in the wider region , that will be caused by this dam ?    3.151592780482938
can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well ?    2.4068886789409074
we will certainly raise the point made by the honourable member .    3.0615495799518317
we have heard anxieties expressed on that point and i will ensure it is taken up .    2.5500901519298362
there have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the UNK heritage in the area .    2.8461569123756076
we will raise that , too , in the representations we make .    3.406949501191515
a number of other UNK - electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in turkey have raised matters of concern , such as the effect on displaced farmers .    2.4855854000787723
on the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and i hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the commission is participating in any form .    3.3552201791323686
question no 39 by ( h - 0036 / 00 ) :    2.2443421617860047
subject : drafting of charter of fundamental rights the general public welcomes the fact that a charter of fundamental rights is to be drawn up . it is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of europe in the 21st century .    2.790617582394834
what are the commission ' s views on the substance of the charter ? what type of rights will the charter set out ( economic , social and cultural ) ?    2.1944221926165746
which citizens will it cover ( those of the european union or the citizens of all european countries with a view to enlargement ? will it cover immigrants etc . ? )    2.4440027230603354
will it set out established social rights in the european union or will it set a broader agenda ?    2.4892713815905734
what means will the charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes ?    2.257762060143202
what are the commission ' s views on incorporating the charter into the treaty on european union ?    2.511173218811389
like the honourable member , the commission welcomes the decision taken by the heads of state and government to start the process of drawing up a european charter of fundamental rights . in the conclusions of the cologne european council the heads of state and government even established the broad outlines of the charter ' s content .    2.7024014126923985
according to these conclusions , the charter must contain three categories of rights . the first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights , as guaranteed by the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .    2.5568424077151
the second is the rights reserved for citizens of the european union . the third is economic and social rights , as contained in the european social charter and the community charter of the fundamental social rights of workers , insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the union .    3.2588836494944955
the commission considers that the convention responsible for drawing up the charter of fundamental rights must respect the mandate given by the cologne european council .    2.6144240883301118
having said that , this does not mean that the convention should be limited to a UNK role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources .    2.7540008772383597
as i have said before in this house , the commission is convinced that the convention must be able , if necessary , to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances , particularly technological and social changes .    3.070852886408226
however , given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the heads of state and government , this power must be exercised with caution and on a case - by - case basis .    2.3809411713963224
the rights conferred by this charter will have at least two types of beneficiary .    2.4148979299857563
some rights will apply to anyone present in the eu territory while others will benefit only citizens of the european union .    2.5677791757665274
it may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the european union and third - country nationals meeting certain conditions .    2.754838371311371
it is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the charter to prejudge its content in more detail .    2.3562844835221046
however , i can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future european charter of fundamental rights . this is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the ec treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the member states .    2.5047790237040495
as i have also said before to this house , the commission is favourable to UNK the charter in the eu treaty .    3.9711696301194683
however , we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the heads of state and government .    2.974199568246198
the difficult part , which will fall to the convention , is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the treaties .    3.047161044347814
in its opinion on the holding of an intergovernmental conference to amend the treaties , the commission noted that the european council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the igc agenda , in particular the european charter of fundamental rights .    3.3385298381036583
we hope that this important cologne council decision will become a reality .    2.533017538935349
globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other , make it urgently necessary to define those rights .    2.8802593137918207
seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the european council in nice will not be a wasted meeting .    3.3055897966980052
but if we are to secure the public ' s participation in this new planning , we would like to learn what plan the european bodies and specifically the commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of europe in the twenty - first century .    2.8043942815420024
i listened to your general guidelines and i would like to ask you what is the position of children , as entities in their own right , in the commission ' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty - first century .    3.181321435020944
mr president , mrs kratsa - tsagaropoulou , in my opinion , and as mr prodi said this morning , the drawing up of the charter is an exercise with great political significance . this is because it shows that the union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project .    3.0671601721848765
in this context , the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated .    2.6131249751971994
the essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the european institutions , as contained in the european project enshrined in the treaties of the european union .    3.832960896085919
i understand your concern about the rights of children .    3.1872878988067415
many elements of our work , and particularly of my work as commissioner for justice and home affairs , involve protecting the rights of children .    2.9909539876082305
this is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully .    3.107900971003368
each member state is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children .    2.374515174333283
as for the eu ' s responsibility , the rights of children must be recognised in the charter according to the areas in which the union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship , in its broadest sense , of children .    3.280398310677924
i hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable member has posed for the commission and the whole convention .    3.2586557897516055
mr president , i have had the privilege of hearing the commissioner a number of times on this issue and i very much agree with his approach .    2.9131008093894852
however , i should like to ask a slightly different question .    2.672411667201611
we have just heard commissioner barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the commission towards the major issues that the community is dealing with this year .    2.8424533407336123
would the commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a citizens charter ?    3.5081937275962347
it is very important that the people feel engaged in this process .    2.9820555428205804
i know that the convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the commission has .    3.8500186809485037
will the commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate ?    2.6875049422655914
it is the policy of the commission to promote an open and wide debate on the charter of fundamental rights , not only with non - governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far - reaching as the charter is .    3.4268126141190955
i can assure you that the commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future charter of fundamental rights .    3.1219939230489433
we can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text , a text that can be easily read by the citizens , and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument .    2.94621196098014
there is no contradiction between the two .    2.8140636751340855
the challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the charter .    3.1003237550447564
i am very glad to know that i can count on your support here .    2.6918502314186696
question no 40 by ( h - 0095 / 00 ) :    2.40144641552313
subject : articles 6 . 1 , 7 . 1 and 7 . 2 of the treaty on european union article 6 . 1 of the treaty states that the union is based on principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .    2.859294951841583
it is clear from statements over the past years that jörg haider and the freedom party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in austria .    2.4234894352480705
therefore , will the commission state when they intend to propose under article 7 . 1 that there is ' the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the principles mentioned in article 6 . 1 . ' , and urge the council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this treaty to austria including the voting rights of the representative of austria in the council ?    2.6948373732683493
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the commission with regard to the formation of the new austrian government . this was reiterated this morning in president romano prodi ' s speech on that government which includes ministers from jörg haider ' s freedom party .    2.6541784265975896
the commission confirmed then , as it does today , that it shares the concerns underlying the portuguese presidency ' s statement of 1 february 2000 .    3.194702070853679
these concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them .    2.7700045914203284
the fact that an openly extremist , racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a member state of the european union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other states that are taking part in the european project . the european commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either .    3.380633613340095
secondly , the commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the treaties , specifically with regard to articles 6 and 7 of the treaty on european union .    2.6520354339534946
one of the most important innovations provided by the treaty of amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the member states . another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled , and which would react if any of them were violated .    2.6150841726652314
the commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars : that of the rule of law .    2.7542900535935013
this principle means that the commission must act within the limits laid down by the treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 february was made .    3.8661828509296865
the commission is not a state . it cannot and must not act as if it were one .    2.8724576950724883
in order to give a precise answer to your question , mr ford , i must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by article 7 . 1 of the treaty on european union to be applied , there must be proof of the existence and i quote , of a " serious and persistent breach by a member state of the principles mentioned in article 6 . "    3.111876718807435
i repeat , a " serious and persistent breach " is the condition necessary for the commission to be able to propose to the council that measures be adopted against a member state .    3.2495305665838856
i think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in austria .    3.1625091722371805
as a matter of fact i think that i am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled , either in austria or in any other member state .    2.991378929284107
i would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the commission , as stated once again by president prodi this morning , to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in article 7 .    3.0711593842069314
i would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary .    2.473492839514883
the values at stake are too central , too fundamental for us to accept UNK or compromises .    2.399823483797515
individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say .    2.5409074649588903
in austria ' s case , the statements are contradictory to say the least .    2.8696427092696037
on the one hand , any of us could pick up on a whole UNK of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the freedom party .    2.435055351353999
on the other hand , the new austrian government ' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights .    2.8439860749638926
we will soon have our first opportunity , and an excellent opportunity it will be , to see which one of these two faces of the freedom party is the real one .    3.2863373128280218
i am referring to the position the austrian government will adopt at the council with regard to the commission ' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives .    3.2696309378524138
one applies to the principle of treating people equally , without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin . the other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin , religion , handicap or sexual persuasion .    2.1357140157324146
lastly , i would like to assure you , mr ford , that the commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities , should it prove necessary .    3.4232862260943486
i thank the commissioner for his reply to my question .    2.750309657981438
but is commissioner vitorino aware , not only of mr haider ' s and the freedom party ' s words , but also of their deeds ?    3.3773799082997358
mr haider has actually been in government in the southern province of carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the slovene - speaking minority in that region who are austrian citizens , where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the roma and immigrant communities .    2.210606513289265
could the commissioner answer two questions .    2.65008644111352
firstly he talked about verification .    2.579229465049853
can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it ?    2.790585473196707
secondly , does he not agree that were the current government , at a national level , to pursue the kind of policies that mr haider and the freedom party have pursued at regional level , then there clearly would be a breach of article 6 ( 1 ) of the treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the commission to take the necessary action ?    3.1249827402019297
we are not talking about words here .    2.537158787437367
we are talking about deeds by the freedom party and mr haider .    2.592392631517497
it is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the member states according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in article 6 and justify the use of article 7 of the treaty .    3.5035940652466318
therefore i am fully confident that the commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in austria , as in any other member state .    3.3814767204970275
if any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one member state occurs , we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly .    2.66064073547438
i also rely not only on the cooperation of the members of the european parliament , but also on the cooperation of non - governmental organisations , which have always made an important contribution to the anti - discrimination policy of the commission .    3.435295457395723
regarding the situation in carinthia , we need to look at this in detail .    3.791201227991283
the honourable member raised the question .    3.1565767328882135
the protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the commission has put before the council .    3.2402709028982923
we should not only focus this debate on the austrian question .    3.0945900098995334
that question calls for reflection , for debate and , if necessary , for action .    2.65745144757039
i sincerely hope that all member states will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the commission has presented to the council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination , racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur .    3.1822134163168903
second part    3.3723082764243566
questions to mrs wallström    3.3018652747507153
question no 41 by ( h - 0021 / 00 ) :    2.3119781005807343
subject : surplus electrical and electronic equipment each year the european union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment ( 6 million tonnes ' worth in 1998 ) , mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent .    2.340927555066337
the environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances ( lead , cadmium , mercury , hexavalent UNK , pvc and UNK flame UNK ) .    2.024665841948322
a preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions , the most recent of which dates from july 1999 .    2.468301619671819
can the commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft , which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998 ?    2.192999834352524
is it true that the us government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the world trade organisation ( for infringement of article xi of the gatt and article 2 ( 2 ) of the agreement on technical obstacles to trade ) if it is adopted ?    2.578264520714345
the commission agrees with meps that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems .    2.199594483562587
consequently , the commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and , since 1997 , has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned .    3.5270161646783613
the outcome of the discussions , as well as of the in - depth investigations which are being carried out in this area , are now being examined by the commission .    3.604558512003178
some parts of the proposal have been criticised , among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants , as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .    2.6784023174298293
the united states ' delegation to the european union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper , inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned , as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers ' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .    3.187023850452119
the main argument put forward by the united states in this context is that the present provisions are , they say , incompatible with international trade law .    3.289578727787793
the commission is currently carefully reviewing the united states ' arguments .    2.8091543296066126
i should just like to add that my intention is that the commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before UNK .    3.0979591130248174
my question specifically concerned the reaction of the us government to the text of the preliminary draft .    2.693512433754533
there have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one , to my knowledge , dating from july 1999 .    2.308312499302259
version 3 is already much weaker than version 2 following the comments of us industry as relayed by the us government .    2.117405859089849
i note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible , you are referring in fact to the rules of the world trade organisation .    3.0723941917318918
the arguments of the us government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the wto rules .    2.730882712321511
this worries me because this means that , when adopting texts , we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the world trade organisation . this will fundamentally weaken european environmental legislation and particularly this proposal .    2.692483008364748
it is important for me to have a chance to answer it .    3.5251383214911494
it is clear that in a process such as this , where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in europe , there is an on - going dialogue between the different parties concerned .    3.2700046952800763
the dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal .    2.5550004690334314
parts of it have been strengthened , but other parts may well contain too many compromises .    2.1912854790287253
we are still in the process of preparing a text , and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment .    3.3936732045081954
i do not think that the intervention of the united states should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations .    2.5684999194987768
i strongly oppose using the wto and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the eu from introducing radical environmental standards .    2.027916061426333
i start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these .    3.08580275666709
however , i do want to listen to all the points of view .    3.1504664631974357
for example , i recently met representatives of the UNK industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal .    2.414334958075533
however , i totally reject any suggestion that i would allow the united states to determine the shape of our directive .    2.91832040142579
subject : gender and environment practically all the contributors involved in the rio and kyoto processes - individual organisations , UNK action groups , governments , the world bank , the un and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision - making on the environment .    2.3047188431741286
more women in decision - making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well .    2.0658123733702
is the commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision - making in the environmental field ?    3.26401447649597
in 1988 , the commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men .    3.3702667018985015
through the current programme , which covers the period 1997 to 2000 , we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender - specific needs are taken into consideration .    2.717634112499269
one of the programme ' s aims is to develop and supervise methods , strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision - making process and in positions of responsibility .    2.521787861711796
within the framework of the action plan , each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures .    2.634736402885908
one of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions .    2.8884448969667917
the new commission ' s own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office .    3.3661806296060663
the same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the directorate - general for the environment , where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women .    2.265115792168671
our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions .    2.603762694547833
currently , women hold 24 . 5 per cent of our a - grade posts , and we hope the number will increase steadily .    2.5194408573053093
moreover , we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups .    2.8211769437769934
as regards our external partners , all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to UNK their decision - making processes .    2.780284079808429
with respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality , as you know , this principle is included in the treaty of amsterdam .    3.0432943986891883
article 3 of the treaty states that , in all the activities referred to in this article , the community shall aim to eliminate inequalities , and to promote equality , between women and men .    3.516250748050901
the commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field .    2.8169829570142975
i should , of course , like to take this opportunity to say that i appreciate the role played by the european parliament ' s committee on women ' s rights and equal opportunities , particularly its chair .    3.0285117833715725
i should just like to recall that , during the lengthy process of approving the present commission , every commissioner was questioned by the women ' s committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field .    2.534047852899973
we shall be monitoring each commissioner carefully , so the other commissioners have now been UNK .    2.7391810875663873
thank you for your reply .    2.457612531837605
i interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields .    2.503286833733721
environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work .    2.2903639096367354
i naturally want to know whether the commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes .    3.01811083522801
this is a crucial goal .    2.967319128928029
in order for all policies to be similarly UNK by the concept of equality , it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required .    3.1619387890820785
( sv ) my understanding of mainstreaming is , of course , that this should characterise everything we do .    2.8762849513272504
for example , i am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the commission .    2.627223346307127
if we are to be able to motivate everybody , i believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or , if you prefer , from the bottom up .    3.0665994891320763
my impression of environment - related work , broadly speaking , is that in many instances it is dominated by women .    2.5323875230866344
this state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high - ranking positions in the environmental field .    2.3133042486978193
i should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention , but there is certainly room for improvement .    2.5051257595086645
i have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up .    2.344872374190822
i hope that this will be of benefit .    3.218803794370503
question no 43 by ( h - 0045 / 00 ) :    2.386750992228663
subject : the boyne estuary and the drogheda port company the boyne estuary is designated a special protection area ( spa ) under the wild birds directive and is under consideration for designation as a special area of conservation under the habitats directive , as it is an area of international importance .    1.907037616469851
however , the department of the marine , UNK county council and drogheda corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the spa and even the elimination of a mudflat at stegrennan recently added to the spa specifically at the commission ' s insistence .    2.421806072205625
what is more , a very large warehouse has been constructed , in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the drogheda corporation .    2.4565123636275854
how can the commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the structural funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area ?    3.0436470933992035
is the commission ready to suspend funding completely , pending a review of the development plans of the area ?    2.5170411497608423
the commission is aware of the construction of the harbour , but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable member .    2.985302084762569
the harbour construction project is receiving support from the structural funds and chiefly involves UNK the river boyne estuary and UNK the UNK on the mudflats at stegrennan .    2.7461886448046444
the boyne estuary is designated a special protection area under the wild birds directive .    2.1319813599234543
that means that any development that takes place in or near the boyne estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the community ' s habitats directive .    3.0348537436580556
since 1998 , the commission has received a number of complaints UNK that the harbour will damage the mudflats at stegrennan , which are now designated a part of the special protection area , and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed .    3.731554919807894
after UNK these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the structural funds - the commission became convinced , in the summer of 1999 , that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour .    2.7231173833269526
an in - depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out .    2.7130134262880015
the most serious harm caused by the project , the damage to the stegrennan mudflats , was only to be temporary , and the UNK were liable for completely restoring the mudflats .    2.7277463464398366
furthermore , to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats , the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved .    2.235357804924084
however , since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute .    2.357023737248189
firstly , the irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements .    2.6142942051909976
they then renewed their commitment after an irish non - governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the irish courts .    2.1250858143692217
however , the new commitment included some minor changes which , in turn , led to a further complaint .    2.8405948952119795
in view of the fact that the irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved , the commission will not , for the present , propose that financial support from the structural funds should be suspended .    3.2939829346378886
however , it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the irish authorities , particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the irish courts .    2.693113152396575
- i do not quite understand what the commissioner said .    3.401806799364007
the mudflat at UNK , which was made a special protection area at the request of the commission , has been completely destroyed at this stage .    3.236047099258633
it is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of eu directives .    2.3948021116205327
you say there will be no further funding .    3.037891748762006
i would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation .    2.8845972251187058
if not , why not ?    2.5979525955836666
if you are , when exactly are you going to do it ?    3.1254870649556787
is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence , and also the authority which basically takes the money from the eu and gives it to a company that it owns 100 % ?    2.3416531344592753
is this right and proper ?    3.0441159955798973
any eu funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of eu directives .    2.892538070324588
even the area designated by the commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed .    2.4636003551203878
compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done .    3.132265798226799
the first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place .    2.2633680256963165
as a result , the irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means .    2.1764022771600406
the use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what i referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically - harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary .    2.3577535107003316
there is to date no UNK outcome to this legal challenge .    2.515633005230979
the adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities , and does not require prior commission approval .    3.2502659937878327
the commission ' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the birds directive are fully met , and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging .    2.847610327614668
in this case , the commission proposes to seek further clarification from the irish authorities on the up - to - date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass .    2.4987344815865966
we are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the structural funds .    2.9517640772583276
mr president , sadly , the specific case raised by mrs mckenna is not an isolated one .    2.454751450865053
there are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of eu funding .    2.3432411764379877
will the commission consider issuing instructions to all member states saying that , if in future it UNK that european environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out , it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted , in other words , UNK the money from the member states ?    2.862042928734923
.    2.489189446364389
( sv ) this is a very important question .    3.5697981844709297
the message contained in the joint text is still valid .    3.270317270563505
we cannot hand out money with one hand and , with the other , take countries to court , where they may well be UNK . it is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy .    3.2530827273501783
the result may , of course , be some difficult questions of priorities .    2.724422240255174
in my view , the most important consequence , however , is that countries should do some careful thinking and , above all , make sure they send in their lists of natura 2000 sites .    2.5816034303062754
then we will be in a position to carry out UNK monitoring and follow - up procedures .    3.297831471188618
in that respect , ireland falls short , like other member states , but we hope that the pressure we are UNK will produce results .    3.182825705191209
i should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good .    2.5943584192653564
the rules of procedure do not allow this .    2.9026823178405654
you will have to discuss this outside the chamber .    3.415855891047461
questions to mr barnier    3.510194311579616

question no 44 by ( h - 0020 / 00 ) :    2.336975847981726
subject : partnership arrangements and the third community support framework for greece the recent regulation ( ec ) 1260 / 1999 laying down general provisions on the structural funds places greater emphasis than the previous regulation on stronger partnership , involving the regional and local authorities and other public bodies , the economic and social partners and all other relevant bodies not only in the preparation but also in the funding , monitoring and assessment of the measures taken .    2.527038608237493
however , local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that ' partnership ' arrangements under the new csf for greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance .    2.035025980552078
in what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third csf and what steps will the commission take to ensure greater participation by the ' partners ' in all measures taken under the new csf ?    2.6168717747039216
may i quickly add something to the answer given just now by mrs wallström to mr martin ?    2.200284131450391
this was a joint letter between our two predecessors and i consider , as the successor to mrs wulf - mathies , that this letter is still valid . i will actively endeavour with mrs wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the structural funds with the eu environmental directives and policies .    2.6279484040916166
i am also saying this as a former environment minister .    2.710165262596439
turning now to the question posed by mr alavanos , who i hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject , the commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor , during the preparation of the new programming period , the application of the partnership principle .    3.31778711121162
the involvement of regional and local authorities in the community ' s action is , as you know , one of the essential elements of the new post - berlin structural funds regulation .    3.6038003187378926
with regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next community support framework for greece , the commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the greek regional development plan for the 2000 - 2006 period .    2.972034847425812
mr alavanos knows that i have been to greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster . during these visits , i held discussions with the greek government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement .    2.380553636348693
as for subsequent phases , in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes , it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level . it must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the csf at national , regional and local level .    2.900369770470233
as for the monitoring and management of these programmes , i have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the greek government pursuant to article 8 of the new regulation .    3.651458260657473
in the current negotiations on this third community support framework , i have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected , with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non - governmental organisations and associations .    3.1245743097220204
within the third csf , this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee .    2.9133391188469218
this is all i can say .    2.847992683778702
however , things are really quite different .    2.4454498890885636
the operation of the community support framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state , government and party UNK as regards the european union ' s funding .    3.008138854380965
i cannot show you the television programmes here but i can show you the greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections .    2.326633737241024
in the UNK papers all over greece : the ministry of public works concerning the structural fund : the minister ' s work ; the ministry of agriculture : the minister ' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the ministry of telecommunications : the work of the minister for telecommunications ; the ministry of education : the work of the minister for education and a photograph of the minister ; the ministry of employment : the work of the minister for employment , a photograph of the minister and a photograph of the state secretary , and behind them all the symbols of the community support framework .    2.4318142802078455
there are only a few weeks to go before the elections .    2.8875381064463457
this is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates , financed by the european union , the csf .    2.812197220422862
my question to the commissioner is this : what is to be done ?    4.278611271421714
will the commission remain silent ?    2.8231323016653103
will it discuss the matter ?    2.705769979078054
will it bring it up with the greek government or will we persist with the UNK situation we had with the previous commission ?    3.025663921986193
mr alavanos , i see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited .    2.8729627070221007
would you let me have these documents so that i can read them , after i have had them translated ? i can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication , which i can only welcome as the commissioner for regional policy , and what is propaganda .    3.1727034766854363
then if it is really necessary for me to do this , i will make comments or recommendations to the greek government .    3.878536994834711
i would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or i will come and get them from you later on .    2.2379327774690485
having said that , i thought your question related more to the partnership issue .    2.5345105479988215
further to your questions on the pre - electoral period , i can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non - governmental organisations .    2.5857266949163984
i can only quote what is contained in the general structural funds regulation which specifies that the commission will work with the governments of the member states . it is therefore the greek government which is my primary partner .    3.288508095983365
subsequently , if i need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised , then i will do this .    3.191224000400881
i think that my colleague mr alavanos will be giving all these UNK to the commissioner so that he may be aware of them , because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting community programmes .    2.9081382683007986
however , turning to the substance , i should like to ask the commissioner to bear in mind the following : that for all national and regional programmes , greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the european union - via its central administration , its central government .    2.7258898020171816
from that point of view , neither local governments and much less non - governmental organisations , for example the farming UNK which would be interested in further development of the farming sector , have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third community support framework , nor have they had any involvement in the previous csfs .    2.62434257447703
what can the commission do about that ?    2.7001237806032137
mr UNK , i can only repeat what i said to mr alavanos .    3.227535993616975
i will monitor this situation very closely . if necessary , within and pursuant to the structural funds regulation , i will make comments on the use made , not of structural funds which are not yet committed , but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these structural funds .    3.155482487531384
however , i am obliged to respect the national authority with which i must conduct these negotiations .    2.6115027532477946
having said this , i will look at the situation objectively .    3.327410635130008
as for the rest , if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - i think you spoke of a cooperative structure - i am ready and willing , on the basis of suggestions from meps - you will be acting within your role and i within mine - to relay these suggestions , provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the structural funds regulation .    2.555327047899462
why would i not say that we have noticed in previous years , on the part of the greek government , some shortcomings in the application of the new regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society ?    3.655168912620668
i am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted , this must be remedied .    2.390670009358311
i will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new community support framework .    3.4355108573769275
-    3.592232163151082
question no 45 by ( h - 0041 / 00 ) :    2.365022732970833
subject : structural fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field can the commission confirm that in the last structural fund programming period , 1994 - 1999 , no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas ?    2.4119499212075257
can we expect that structural fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional , renewable energy sources ?    2.7217964005641697
will the structural funds also finance the large - scale energy transmission networks ?    2.694561573184123
on mrs isler béguin ' s first point i must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the community ' s priorities during the previous programming period .    2.92701189108579
the support allocated by the structural funds for technological cohesion , or research and technical developments , within the community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately eur 7 . 5 billion .    2.5562592182451467
this is about 6 % of the whole community contribution .    3.729279354460478
with regard to your specific concern , i can say that , as in the previous period , the commission does not intend to directly finance through the structural funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission .    3.615974979060944
however , it is still the responsibility of the member states ' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these csfs .    3.104434764843992
consequently , even though this is not a community priority , a member state can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area , provided that these projects contribute to regional development . the commission does not have to be systematically informed of these .    3.24616928722911
on your second point of renewable energy which , as you know , is of great interest to me , the commission ' s approach is given in the document on the structural funds and their coordination with the cohesion funds .    3.3146817245682407
these funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources , where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level .    2.355608942622216
the structural funds contribution which has enabled greater UNK of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the transport and energy department .    2.586931469827175
finally , on large - scale energy transmission networks , the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation .    2.1244448312805986
this is particularly valid for the region of the azores which i have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions . it is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains , for example .    2.810203099069152
commissioner , thank you for your answer . however , i asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled ' international UNK experimental UNK ' .    2.712664229518711
this project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for structural funds , such as those listed in objective 1 , might welcome this type of installation .    2.701009289354539
we would like to know whether the commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific ' nuclear research ' context .    2.706627413986111
you did not fully answer the last part of my question on large - scale energy transmission networks .    2.339796985133683
could you please give an answer on this issue ?    2.8139476905131455
you are concerned about whether the structural funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere .    3.4270925128814844
quite simply there is no question of this .    3.184647044481924
i said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the member states pursuant to the structural funds regulation .    3.2502836352817974
as a result , the commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected .    3.1171381270916974
however , you are right to question me as this is your task , as mine is to answer you .    2.6742944401490143
i will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between member states and the commission and i will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point .    3.060479421196753
the member state or states concerned will then be required to answer me and i will send you this answer as soon as possible .    2.5624877712719476
i thought i had answered your question on large - scale energy transmission networks .    2.248064438913446
the energy situation varies widely from region to region in the european union . assistance from the structural funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions , particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped .    2.649665786675771
this is the only answer i can give you on the link between large - scale energy transmission networks and the structural funds .    2.45279117841788

question no 46 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.109100514099759
subject : structural funds and additionality in the light of the commission ' s recent helpful response to my priority written question about structural funds and additionality , i wish to ask whether the commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality .    3.0257800009683327
in particular , would the commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of member states but also within member states , with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries ?    2.898657023827488
mr maccormick , the commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated , for the 2000 - 2006 period , in article 11 of the general regulation on the funds .    3.2476791314504805
as in the past , these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the structural funds and all development expenditure of the member state .    3.5621251625202683
the cofinancing provided by the member state does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure .    3.2400066231889015
as for the budgetary provisions within the member states , between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries , these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules .    2.305537385632812
however , after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post - berlin structural funds regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle .    2.7080897796409378
- i am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content .    2.696549296735846
we are left with article 11 ( 1 ) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the member states .    2.263063580870839
very well : that is to be the UNK rule .    4.417839196134094
does section 11 ( 1 ) conceivably authorise the following practice .    2.3558459452533813
when an autonomous region ' s or country ' s funding from european structural funds increases , the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region , so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the union .    2.4336716944898478
is that really authorised ?    2.8308317011486466
unfortunately i do not have time to go into depth on this issue . if mr maccormick would be satisfied with my partial agreement with his reasoning , i will give him a full answer in writing by restating the legal bases of both article 11 in general and article 11 ( 1 ) in particular .    2.5441648277892877
i am aware of the member ' s competence on these matters .    3.288266595844528
i also know the particular problems in your constituency in scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects .    2.104890153507091
however , on a general level , i would say that in all cases it is the structural funds expenditure which must be additional . this is how , provided that the member state does not reduce all its own expenditure , the structural funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected .    3.599901776529507
i will go further in the written answer which i have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely .    2.828246841112906
- additionality is a major issue too in wales , which i represent .    2.875400340489168
just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no - confidence and the resignation of the first secretary of the national assembly of wales .    2.8609129223046756
and yet we still have these problems in wales and in scotland .    2.6101876843466982
could the commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the uk government ?    2.822425527504943
i take this to mean that the debate of which i was aware in scotland is also occurring in wales .    2.97685219226846
i will verify this point and , if you wish , i will give you a written answer at the same time as the one i have promised to mr maccormick .    3.0896890441880553
question no 47 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.142887684759509
subject : amount which andalusia will receive from the structural funds for the 2000 - 2006 period according to the commission ' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the berlin summit ( which include per capita gdp , the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants ) , what amount is to be allocated to andalusia from the structural funds for the 2000 - 2006 period ?    2.657417509351999
questions to mr bolkestein    3.3007799940311466
mr president , i will try to be brief in UNK the member ' s question . the regional development plan submitted by the spanish authorities on 29 october does not indicate how the community funds will be allocated among the spanish objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of andalusia will receive .    2.3251693153659656
as i did not fully understand the plan , i contacted the minister for economic and financial affairs , mr UNK , in a letter of 14 december which i have here , to ask him for more information on the document submitted .    3.1404718918572714
in the coming weeks , the commission will start negotiations with the spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the community support framework for the new period of 2000 - 2006 . during these meetings i can assure you that the commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation .    3.0931686618588476
therefore , if you wish , as soon as i have this information by sector and region , i will personally send you the information on andalusia .    3.0229912843013356
mr commissioner , the problem is that when mr aznar comes to the european union to receive money for all the people of andalusia , he counts all of them , but when he goes to the andalusia council to pay for services , he fails to notice 400 000 andalusians , and this is very serious , because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of strasbourg or a city larger than UNK , full of children .    2.740390141407428
this question is very important and i would like to know - since this is a kind of ' baby fraud ' - whether the commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the andalusians , so that the funds which the european union are going to pay to andalusia , based on the census , will take into account these 400 000 children which aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services .    3.2110404740475036
mrs izquierdo rojo , i would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly community matters .    3.3262726960746494
i know that these are very important issues in spain and there are differing viewpoints .    3.1250394210834767
i would point out to the commissioner that mr aznar is the president of the spanish government .    3.0398665986083033
you may answer the question .    2.7164350536608795
mrs izquierdo rojo , i hear that you have a strong voice . i hope it is loud enough to be heard in madrid for i realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me .    2.573918560534862
i am keen that the structural funds , particularly those in objective 1 , are allocated where needed .    2.7173672901209183
we have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of europe should or could receive .    2.6833040486883744
i can only say that i must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country . i am not avoiding the issue but i must abide by the general regulation .    3.1024558044054324
it is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible .    2.1976565974760227
i need to know about this allocation , however , and this is why i said that i could not answer today .    3.765624225944422
as i did not have an answer , i wrote to the minister for economic and financial affairs on 14 december .    2.846384601886565
i am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but i will send you this when i get it .    2.114178220522324
i regret that the commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and , in this case , passionate intervention .    3.0534080192331756
i would like to remind all of you that spain is about to hold elections , and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections .    2.4762065077200495
it should be of comfort to the commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time , since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again .    3.070132320179947
i do believe it is important to say that andalusia is going to receive 50 % more within the community support framework and that spain also holds the record for the use of the structural funds , which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different community support frameworks .    2.8246242426900223
lastly i would like to ask the commissioner a specific question : do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the structural funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable ?    3.0494711148350615
this is a UNK debate which i realise is not totally community - related .    2.622523192422614
having said this , we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the european union .    3.160451825849215
i am pleased that the structural funds are the subject of discussions in greece and spain .    3.0683694802964343
we were talking a short while ago in this house about debates involving our citizens , about public debates .    2.621859299661654
the more we talk about europe and what europe is doing for daily life , even when we disagree , the better this will be , provided that we talk about this objectively .    2.832123670046827
i am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the structural funds regulation .    3.085167923966207
this regulation was adopted just last year in berlin and i will be applying it for the next seven years .    2.967175689188455
we will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which i regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this house and for outlining future prospects . the time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted .    2.421490231379071
for the time being , please let me apply the regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in berlin .    2.7208148115363406
this is all i can say today .    2.768171363323117
thank you very much for your replies , mr barnier .    2.351429920306235
questions nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing .    2.03831872836811
question no 51 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.105387552843435
subject : new premises for the ohim at present the office for harmonisation in the internal market ( ohim ) is still operating from the same temporary premises , even though its new building was opened in june 1999 .    2.15557284371935
in view of this unusual situation , will the commission say why the ohim has not yet moved to its new premises ?    2.5434109791859805
the honourable member asked a question on this topic in november 1999 and i would like to refer him to the answer given at the time .    2.909448438684946
furthermore , i have asked the president of the office for harmonisation in the internal market , that is to say the office in alicante , to comment further on this new question and i can , as a result , inform the honourable member as follows , on behalf of the office :    3.1959438583787483
the office is not yet ready to move into the new building .    2.8598231126422053
unfortunately , a number of deadlines have been exceeded .    3.0116926185167996
a number of technical provisions need to be made , such as the installation of a computer network , UNK , a UNK and furniture .    3.962481484536154
the ohim is now in the process of UNK this and is expecting to move into the new premises by june .    2.660813954519563
during the previous question , we were discussing electoral issues .    2.7766032836400414
i believe that this issue is relevant to my question . commissioner , you were not present at the extraordinarily named ' official opening ' of the headquarters of the ohim on 9 june , in the middle of an election campaign in spain leading up to both the european elections and the local and regional elections .    2.497071581300271
if you had been there , i am sure you would have been ashamed .    3.4179367381319334
the president of the commission and some UNK were present .    3.198122800472414
in the middle of an election campaign , a series of authorities , all of them run by the party in government , made clearly electioneering speeches which , furthermore , were broadcast live on television .    2.4608121046548637
it was bizarre to see the president of the region of UNK UNK the work of the spanish government , as well as his own work , although it was irrelevant to that event .    3.7228490402261145
the opening of a building which was not finished , in the middle of an election campaign , which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied , makes the spanish government look ridiculous .    2.6100758544062903
i am not worried that the spanish government should look foolish , because at the end of the day it was their responsibility , but it does worry me that the commission should look foolish by endorsing , through its presence , this absurd event .    2.650520188293732
i would therefore like to ask you , mr commissioner : does it seem normal to you that an UNK building should be opened during an election campaign ?    2.403364780769752
does it seem normal to you that the commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the spanish government ?    2.789036419722234
it does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one member state or another .    2.365965190334131
i have to UNK that i fail to comprehend why a certain opening UNK was held in spain .    2.508779926138281
what i can say is that i hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible .    3.0152683393136432
may i also add that i hope to be in alicante myself at the end of may to speak at a conference .    2.913038501233333
i hope that this building will then be occupied .    2.6595956954516278
i would like to point out to the commissioner that it is not an electoral question .    3.1776311091856755
as members of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons .    3.29677947742987
a year later , it is still not functioning , which means that the commission spent money on a false opening .    3.15921504288026
we should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified .    2.553195403282326
i would like to reiterate that the commission is UNK with the underlying motivation of member state actions .    3.127752928996932
it is , however , interested in official statements and actions .    2.5729363469948754
we do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in french un UNK d ' intention .    2.6669788224509157
we are concerned with public official actions and events , rather than any possible underlying motivation .    2.4619375890865385
once again , the commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned . it only appreciates that a building for this office is opened and occupied as soon as possible .    2.088165428949196
also , the commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or UNK .    2.5636258636996936
as far as i am concerned , all expenditure is real .    2.2541634789129943
and any remaining UNK , i intend to leave them in the UNK .    3.1002497088679752
subject : alcohol monopoly and the internal market what action does the commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the state alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by sweden , and the associated import restrictions , and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied ?    3.4106878242847243
i would like to answer these two questions as follows .    2.3754942010434004
when sweden joined the european union , it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic UNK which travellers can bring into the country from other member states .    2.559819458272673
this derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 june of this year .    2.550310272607327
sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years , as this would be necessary to protect public health .    3.0184239100624284
my position on this is clear .    3.234409544264774
sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist .    2.4541107182678252
i cannot see a reason , therefore , why a further extension for this measure should be proposed .    2.5551774052544576
european citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use , including taxes , in any member sate and to take them to another member sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them .    2.354899005954864
that is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time .    2.671749523802837
we want to guarantee that swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market , just like other citizens of the european union .    2.777074539295876
this certainly does not mean that i do not share the concern in sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse .    2.6935689997038437
a recent study , carried out by professor lindgren of the university of lund , however , has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in sweden .    2.668781286549334
i have already had a chance to discuss my position with mr ringholm , the swedish finance minister on two occasions .    2.4100818843599963
i also discussed this matter with the swedish parliamentary finance committee last week .    2.327614361743017
it is now up to the swedish government to take the necessary measures .    3.444861420439595
thank you for your reply .    2.457612531837605
i should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the commission . instead of 2004 , it should , of course , be 1 july 2000 .    2.919162625389881
i have some sympathy with the commission ' s standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally .    3.017897413644607
such a rule is only normal .    2.5581542418197123
nevertheless , i should like to ask two questions : are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the swedish government about extending the derogations , for example for as long as denmark and finland have derogations ?    2.4926976424298037
my second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol .    2.5045197722071113
this may , of course , be seen as an issue concerning the internal market , but also as a public health matter for the whole eu .    3.670432206465773
what are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the commission ' s work ?    2.6866384429882753
a europe - wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market . it also has important implications for public health .    2.865403591920006
if we had considered these aspects in their overall context , then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with sweden .    2.346905861757422
may i thank mr andersson for the supplement to his first question and may i answer that question as follows ?    2.39107362785854
firstly , finland and denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003 .    2.384596261480026
these countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003 .    2.720469991312939
however , in the case of sweden , the situation is different .    3.3683899069621583
in 1995 , a five - year derogation period was decided upon , which is now lapsing .    3.0419837008369575
i have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the commission would need to extend this period .    3.2942102877191126
secondly , the swedish government is being consulted all the way .    2.7506374855565294
i can inform mr andersson that i will leave for stockholm on monday , 6 march , in order to talk to minister ringholm , to members of the swedish parliament , and , if necessary , also to the prime minister or other ministers , in order to continue discussions on this matter . i am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in sweden regarding this issue .    2.977838045466933
thirdly , i understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important .    3.1784145114327926
i would repeat at this juncture what professor lindgren of lund university has stated , namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions , the consumption of alcohol will remain the same .    2.330662471452271
the question is then , of course , where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers ?    2.7738657686002655
the answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the swedes themselves , and as mr andersson knows , this is an extremely dangerous and UNK activity .    3.3229026181522774
well now , mr andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol .    2.6565250579033366
but in that case , not only sweden , but all eu countries , should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol .    2.9229025757835783
we can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the united states .    2.7278441192200313
mr andersson will be familiar with what was termed then ' prohibition ' .    2.303544253723234
he will also be aware of the effects the ban had on mafia activity within the united states , where , eventually , prohibition was withdrawn .    2.9212453361328357
all this means that we need to protect health , of course , but not by banning alcohol , because that does not work .    3.5773868846016637
mr president , the question at issue is the income from the swedish alcohol monopoly and when the swedish government says that it must cover health costs , then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves , with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal .    2.2309572746910087
my question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate UNK of good quality alcohol such as UNK wine or bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the swedish budget .    2.1523604014898603
i gather that mr posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter .    2.302571940227056
i also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in sweden goes back to the year UNK and that since then , the sale of alcohol products has UNK for a significant portion of the state ' s tax revenue .    2.8369033129282664
as is known , this has led to a state monopoly in sweden which , in itself , is at odds with union legislation .    2.993747441432282
as to the UNK effect of alcohol - to which , i believe , mr posselt also made reference - i could not agree more with him : i think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant , and perhaps mr posselt , mr andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this parliament one of these days to share an aquavit .    2.4840028680051236
mr president , i listened with interest to the commissioner ' s reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market .    3.152657862260959
i wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the commission to take the french government to the european court of justice on the application of france ' s UNK et UNK , which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in france ?    2.8809839886373654
can we now expect the european commission to take action against the french republic before the european court of justice ?    3.391277698950491
i should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable member , since this matter is now under active consideration by the commission .    2.742631513360278
the commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the european court of justice .    3.228697764023641
my reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now , but i would like to assure the honourable member that the commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks .    3.469676316563442
i ask for the member ' s understanding for this small delay in the commission ' s decision .    3.1380546602748867
commissioner , do you have any reason , on public health grounds , for a difference in the taxation rates on , for example , scotch whisky or french bordeaux wine or even my colleague ' s bavarian beer ?    2.289317129301485
can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in europe ?    2.1007240643571934
the matter of excise taxes , to which the honourable member is referring , is the prerogative of the member state concerned .    3.7065220098399316
the commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products .    2.1045657489368237
towards the end of this year the commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between member states .    3.429589272638575
for example - i believe the honourable member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in france , whereas they are applied in the united kingdom .    2.778735918278888
that leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from france to the united kingdom .    2.4998099404467045
the question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax .    2.291609238136136
the commission has no means of influence here .    2.622625508905944
in the case of sweden , the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol .    2.5730898461393847
although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between sweden and other member states of the union - and that by itself increases cross - border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol .    2.663461646586783
there is , of course , elasticity of demand , in this case a price elasticity of demand .    2.706181112385864
i am not sure exactly what it is , but it is not zero , therefore it must have some effect .    3.17565919207423
granted , as you say , that excise duties lie within the prerogative of member states , nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the community UNK others might still conflict with the single market principle .    3.16314252496443
for example , if we take what mr purvis and i would be thinking of , the malt whisky producing parts of the highlands - a very peripheral part of europe , very hard - pressed , a whole farming community as well as a UNK community dependent upon it - a general practice of UNK the alcohol in scotch whisky , dutch UNK or danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine , seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the member states .    2.3789938585053063
may i assure mr maccormick and other members of this parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between member states is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market .    2.992416940672532
if one looks at petrol , for example , one sees that excise taxes in germany are different from those of holland , and consequently dutch UNK cross the border and fill up their tanks in germany .    2.0418618210826205
that is indeed distortion of the internal market .    2.5879429535484872
if i had my way , i would wave a magic wand and UNK excise taxes across europe .    2.5385661937419717
as a result , smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one member state than another .    2.0934906270267613
but i do not have a magic wand and i do not have my way .    3.23228328121373
this is an area of unanimity , as mr maccormick knows , and unless all member states agree on the equalisation of excise taxes , it will not happen .    2.9375403945721748
once again , towards the end of this year , the commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes , and i am obviously available for any discussion with parliament on that report .    3.476070595019224
thank you very much , commissioner .    1.9725151098002782
today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of alsace wine , although we do not know how much tax is put on it , but i suppose it is a lot .    3.260881189098891
since the time allotted to questions to the commission has elapsed , questions 55 to UNK will be replied to in writing .    2.46052875180058
that concludes questions to the commission .    2.508366787879696
( the sitting was suspended at 7 . 30 p . m . and resumed at 9 . 00 p . m . )    1.766933325929761
community policy in the field of water ( continuation )    2.8969510078860696
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the community action in the field of water policy .    2.9025295735220826
mr president , the situation regarding fresh water in europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but , in general terms , it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease .    3.264682997138047
to this we must add the water pollution problems which UNK the potential new member states in the east .    2.9718597138157667
in fact , a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in romania , threatening UNK which supply the population of yugoslavia .    2.0951383363865883
i understand that mrs wallström , whose presence here tonight i appreciate , is going to visit the area .    2.5452073178629124
i believe that no country , no government and , of course , no member of this parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin .    3.1343597576916755
the development of this directive has been difficult and complex , involving diverse interests and divided opinions .    2.8000425064520624
i have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature , mrs lienemann , has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions , and has succeeded to a large extent .    2.6474605372880067
however , it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations .    2.5146014003943478
i come from a country whose southern half is on the mediterranean and the availability of water UNK depends on the UNK of an UNK climate and a difficult UNK .    2.8728792636946934
the mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this UNK , century after century , year after year , day after day , and is still doing so today .    2.322358843223358
therefore , it seems essential to us that the directive complies , in practice , with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the treaty on the need for community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions .    3.4559761316069433
in accordance with this principle , the spanish delegation of the european people ' s party will oppose amendments nos 4 ( recital 21 ) , 13 and 49 ( article 11 ( d ) , since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the member states , that is , the regulation of water resources .    2.8012244728162203
it would be very difficult for the community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions , given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests .    3.091019375534305
we also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010 .    2.6726629640031874
we must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which , at the same time , safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less - favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development .    2.307667463268804
i would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero , or close to zero , degree of pollution .    2.4909206117656306
in no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution .    2.1191537020324263
we will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions .    2.568913817710283
i hope that , once again , this house will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity , seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations , the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much .    2.9171491141085832
mr president , commissioner , this is a very important directive .    3.0354455579644504
its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems .    3.1452611561921464
the public must have a right to clean water .    3.1608027069802054
it is important not only for the environment but also for public health .    3.2991734577450083
i am not speaking so much for myself , as i happen to be one of those few lucky people in europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home .    2.6492294871590105
we must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality .    2.6305389166766093
action must get under way immediately .    2.74718826765649
we cannot afford to waste time .    2.567641582065188
it is important that the timetable is an ambitious one .    2.6987617422001344
in my opinion , the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then .    2.1265587313485894
it is a question of doing what is technically possible ; obviously it is not possible to do anymore , but we must be sufficiently ambitious .    3.0857059671866187
i would like to comment on one issue , which was spoken about earlier .    2.723372668917699
i believe the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water .    2.5799683723136697
this is not merely a problem for spain ; it is one for the nordic countries , and i sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters , when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive .    3.1541458945086585
mr president , madam commissioner , congratulations , mrs lienemann on an excellent piece of work .    2.3367255050145492
water and air surround us everywhere .    2.5903978228243827
we share them with everyone on this earth .    2.2958815762474045
water is a prerequisite for human life .    2.9265519583902453
and there are more and more of us in the world .    3.8518795395706786
mrs schleicher UNK earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal .    2.1500933434725904
nothing could be further from the truth !    2.7856305499536487
it is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so , too , the conditions for life .    2.8996834528407693
it is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources .    2.3042636187615555
i would therefore appeal to members of parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long - term realism of the highest order .    2.5482050889801213
however , we should look a little more closely at some points .    2.8348039254058772
for example , a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes , which people try to justify by pseudo - developmental arguments , and which , of course , are a great risk to ground waters , water tables and surface waters .    2.517998986131487
i therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such UNK take place , the specifications common to us all must be very stringent .    2.18868540940852
but the key issue is , in my opinion , planning how to restore water tables , the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes , which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind .    2.623884025806816
i think such projects ought to be eligible for funding , because , at the end of the day , that restoration may well prove to be a first - rate development policy .    2.8129065009823093
mr president , here we have what is basically a good measure .    2.341173009113887
it sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management .    2.2428024557472277
its aim of good - quality water for drinking , for wildlife , the environment and economic purposes is right .    2.4244386932051722
the prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood .    2.8534795394592574
we have three outstanding problems .    2.711548956306461
the first is the transfer of water between basin areas .    2.5079522719723593
that is a matter which affects my colleagues from spain , ireland and the united kingdom .    2.675907367788334
amendments nos 4 . 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed , be that arid areas or urban areas .    2.583451291043348
secondly , we have to have realistic targets , but targets nevertheless .    2.8076998604578662
looking at amendment no 7 , for example , which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances , you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic .    2.8764151715252937
also , some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in english , that is quite a meaningless term .    3.1491173515166455
we need to look very carefully at those .    2.4888120743421767
the concept of continuing reduction as in amendment no 58 is much better .    2.537233296309684
thirdly , i raise the problem faced by scotch whisky .    2.256498786613816
scotch whisky - especially malt whisky , which is the best - requires water UNK which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream .    2.487819767090936
some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk .    2.50956488656001
we must make sure that amendments nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in " high quality " , which means it must use good , scottish peat water .    2.1029955706015753
that is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole .    2.329455834154058
mr president , first of all , we want to denounce the UNK hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water , but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against yugoslavia , aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded , have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too , making them not only UNK but even extremely hazardous .    2.313665021103591
turning to the report , we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata , or even in the annihilation of small and medium - scale farmers because of the UNK cost of water for irrigation .    2.922275624039753
we also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country , and especially on the islands , funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water , by increasing not its cost but its quantity . this should mainly be carried out by collecting the UNK that now goes to waste , running off into the sea and eroding the soil , with all the problems that creates .    2.5053723426965093
in that spirit , we support amendment no 107 by mr marset campos .    2.7640851969874407
river waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought .    2.6856319063334375
finally , as regards the council ' s allegation , which the commission echoes , that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein , this is UNK .    3.1262369408150397
its purpose is to preserve a semi - transparent field of action , which during the directive ' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business .    2.1955195312130265
mr president , first and foremost , i want to say that protection of the aquatic environment , both surface water and groundwater , is probably one of our most important duties of all .    2.6415708086822867
that is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is , to a large degree , about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future .    3.4479147812274142
we are all entitled to clean drinking water .    2.588429042499923
i should like to express my great appreciation of mrs lienemann ' s work on this matter .    2.7104360024150638
it has been a huge task , and i should like to express my support for all of mrs lienemann ' s amendments . these are all improvements to the common position .    3.329825951699823
moreover , i shall only highlight the most important ones .    3.4967074377882437
first and foremost , i think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years .    2.955880873915573
i also think it is important that we should put pressure on the member states to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position .    3.0550043019104614
and , finally , i want to say that i think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we , as consumers , are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and , at the same time , obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which , i believe , there is broad agreement .    2.993665099245256
in this regard , too , i think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate .    2.952370660504538
finally , i want to say that i attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges , emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but , at the same time , be set a target , namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero .    2.5162342727853497
if this cannot be adopted as the objective , then i am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020 .    3.0685017858211783
i think that mrs lienemann ' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the council .    3.0187479719487
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive .    2.282452648609272
the second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely ; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in romania must feature in today ' s discussions and also more generally when we UNK the environmental dimension of union enlargement .    2.751286826952197
first of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act .    2.8619458281860273
the cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come .    1.8956474115086768
the event proves that in some countries applying for eu membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the eu .    2.161726222706538
the union ought to UNK how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water .    2.4216169981759803
with regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean , natural groundwater .    2.7095962640946616
in finland surface waters are very clean .    2.4470312083615338
the production of so - called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of UNK a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves .    2.5503214109576655
the process does not require a chemical sewage plant .    2.382886856831181
the directive must not be allowed to UNK this work .    3.4300518853601294
UNK from the council ' s common position , the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water .    2.7019931135304756
this would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed .    2.4000363426817892
the ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by union acts .    2.771834060872348
the work should , of course , be regulated and subject to UNK in the future too , but the same rules cannot apply to , for example , finland and greece , which suffers from drought .    3.367456403782106
mr president , commissioner , water is a precious natural asset , a vital necessity , and it is our duty to protect it .    2.4960588856168324
i think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the european union , which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources , and i congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view .    3.432393775431536
i must say , however , that , there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water , and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way .    3.718603412179709
there are parts of europe with an inherent shortage of water , and that should be taken into account by this directive .    3.4700411712974075
in recent years , climate change has compelled mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain .    2.2509866494840916
we agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled , whose aim is to improve it .    3.262477599227153
however , we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water , granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers .    2.9252317808963113
in addition , amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage .    2.267665194995598
the issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought , i think , to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it .    3.6455405520540367
as for the time scale demanded for the directive ' s implementation , it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive ' s implementation will take time and considerable resources .    2.75992098433417
mr president , commissioner , the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans , comprehensive information and hearing rights , and close cooperation between the member states , to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants .    2.332419816352501
and considering how long this chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind , i am pleased to be present here today , and i would like to congratulate mrs lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us .    2.8460333561159756
i would still like to highlight this point though : this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for UNK water from a member state ' s territory against its will .    2.62435081430102
and by way of reaffirming this once again , i have introduced an amendment - UNK with the support of a large number of members - and i would be very pleased if parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow .    3.4799687351754236
it is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual eu member states and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it .    2.8196534369391237
i am aware , and the previous speaker highlighted this , that there are states in the european union that have problems with water .    3.9360354212111615
i believe that every one of us , in every country , could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way .    2.859988249252106
this applies to every country .    2.5844923857791713
but only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources , when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries , only then , in my view , should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage .    2.9245261814233556
mr president , commissioner , we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading .    2.889271670574595
however , i must say that i am not over - pleased because i believe that this directive is not of great quality , it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings .    3.5492272158536635
firstly , i believe that this directive is excessively tough , simplistic and reductionist .    2.7478235221134533
in many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done , although i know that this is not pleasant .    3.205313183589773
it is not a question of having much tougher regulations , because in many cases the problems concern management . it is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative , the UNK of which we are all well aware of .    3.0659032610969894
this is a reductionist directive . we cannot lump countries with UNK rivers together with countries which lack water , where great UNK open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of UNK or UNK in the sun .    2.4119237080017255
i say this because the ball does not need to be in our court . this issue is in the hands of the governments and the commission .    3.4766239356539606
in the same way , this damage and these tragedies which are happening , as in romania , are not the problem of the legislative , but of the executive and of the governments .    3.260066010032995
furthermore , it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large UNK areas , climatic diversity , desert areas and arid areas .    2.4178423065238213
that is how the common position has been worded .    3.0328601070908268
the same can be said with regard to transfers .    3.141825428558949
transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth , of solidarity between peoples and territories , because unfortunately the earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less .    2.2383123208941504
lastly , i am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact .    3.566084759933354
it is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but , on environmental questions , we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people , how many farmers , could be ruined by having to pay the costs .    2.523765328624591
some kind of study has been done which has not even been read , and i believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice , rather than just laying down doctrine .    2.8571214598823977
it is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface , ground , transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and , in our case in ireland , cross - border level .    3.0241245424558767
ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the european parliament amendments .    4.225043982308342
a 25 - year roll - out for legislation , for example , is hardly acceptable .    2.6628462732330287
we have no difficulty with the " polluter pays " principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial , commercial and agricultural level .    2.332437060428163
however , i feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right , this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge , a quota per household for drinking , UNK and sanitation .    2.452165873994647
we must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly .    2.0494706470125226
the introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977 .    2.289133522852482
meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts , to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements .    2.906401397338018
the whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the eu .    3.4568477398368285
water is a scarce and precious natural resource .    2.473092108944245
ideally , i would like amendment no 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on article 9 would hold on water charges .    3.204859479895782
that would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges , with each member states drawing up its own scheme , so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected .    2.4490301176165366
if amendment no 45 does not fall , i will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that member states may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services .    2.8253666442465772
all legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance .    2.8656474749056007
i believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world .    2.5773832076005934
mr president , commissioner , at this point in the debate i am going to insist on certain aspects which , from an UNK point of view , and since i come from a southern country , i consider to be absolutely essential to this directive .    2.964665006501839
these include , for example , costs and transfers .    3.035900893125341
with regard to costs , i would like clarification of what costs we are talking about .    2.9124378600355225
are we talking about the distribution and UNK of water ?    3.2388235626868465
are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks ?    3.185994973191229
are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services ?    2.6737334731477267
or are we talking about large - scale UNK works and reservoirs ?    2.529775450178907
all these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector .    2.135756027860184
transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas .    2.544134360513543
is the commissioner aware that our country has one of the UNK systems of transfers in europe ?    2.847947310459085
the largest volume transferred in one year has been UNK and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200 .    2.442045233474261
we cannot be accused of bad management .    2.5490067220558035
is the commissioner aware that , of this UNK hm3 , we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the UNK , 30 for water supplies in the area of the júcar , 7 for supplies in the southern area of the júcar and the rest in the segura , equally divided between supplies and irrigation ?    2.3300547864309684
we are not doing a bad job of management .    2.5970853430199417
we cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it .    2.6390708685247994
i will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies , because i believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive .    3.42409050972675
take good note : in this diverse europe , which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation , we have to find diverse solutions , not single solutions .    3.1659992154931467
i therefore appeal to the common sense of the commission , the council and this house so that , when voting , they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of europe in areas where subsidiarity is required .    3.41700826103627
commissioner , andalusia is not lapland .    2.600710365970114
. ( sv ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i want , of course , to begin by thanking the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and , above all , the rapporteur , mrs lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive .    2.73280008635264
water is one of our most important natural resources , as many speakers have already said .    3.309820577554994
an ambitious and well - balanced european policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for europe .    3.206527761686727
water is also one of the issues to which i shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office .    3.0840799896326807
i am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to parliament .    2.6344756862195955
many of them are based upon the very constructive , informal discussions which have taken place between parliament and the council in connection with the first reading .    3.266729288468493
most of parliament ' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious .    2.891848405226976
the commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments , either in their entirety , partially or in principle .    1.942811388438277
many of the amendments which parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary .    2.8366900459224484
with a view to these forthcoming negotiations , i would therefore urge parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position .    3.4100642256045033
firstly , i should like to mention some of my most important arguments .    2.9675800001878225
we now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the ospar convention .    2.836664931932432
rather than make these objectives legally binding , we must consider their political nature .    2.697941850280721
this is also reflected in many of parliament ' s amendments .    3.2677991589896074
where water charges are concerned , the present directive will constitute europe ' s water policy for the next three decades .    3.350284731963466
it is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost - effective way .    2.310962481237927
it sounds good , saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge .    2.590209296859336
but water is not free of charge , any more than houses or food are free of charge .    2.2875163341714404
it is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully UNK as a resource .    2.7829593479953076
in the course of the debate , many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed .    3.048207173715812
i just want to emphasise this further .    2.757513774890638
it is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them .    2.0789298517020716
this is also expressed in recital 14 .    2.6503025870414794
allow me also to say to mr bowe that , in common with my scottish colleague , he need have no UNK of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of scotch whisky now and again .    2.2785398898208498
allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail .    3.3129982077378517
i am glad to see that parliament ' s amendments have focused upon this .    2.716123693152572
the commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the ospar convention into the text .    2.806965622355445
we must , however , keep to their precise scope and content .    2.628620648509588
as i said , their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character .    2.203643308188893
it must nonetheless be guaranteed that the member states and the community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables .    2.840442082178407
i therefore welcome amendments nos 6 , 10 , 14 , 24 , 58 , 60 and 88 .    2.3295984323749495
the commission cannot , on the other hand , approve amendment no 19 , in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in ospar .    2.7607400047745623
the commission ' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances , and so no definition is needed .    2.3386841130098577
even if i too agree with the contents of amendments nos 79 and 106 , these go beyond the commitments under ospar , and i cannot therefore approve these amendments .    2.9393843343617596
the commission can also , in principle , approve amendment no 60 , according to which a timetable is required for implementing the commission ' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances .    2.8630169205167215
amendment no 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed .    2.348270685999344
this would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot , therefore , be approved .    2.7628007399823233
the desire expressed in amendments nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved .    2.311534064424386
lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances .    3.0021174396555312
i would point out in this regard that the ospar convention does not in any way alter existing community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector .    2.444920836886567
the nitrates directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive .    2.573319150007422
i appreciate the fact that parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services .    2.667953377196222
i can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way .    2.667484950065694
i also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs .    2.43279325666511
i can therefore partly , and in principle , approve amendments nos 43 - 46 , together with amendment no 85 .    2.8159224104650318
i believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector .    2.8088555530808117
this would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured .    2.2958908046213358
i therefore support the overall thrust of amendment no 105 , which is in line with the commission ' s original proposal .    3.480927011261383
i also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources .    2.5805844252826993
we are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals .    3.132654224855326
this must not , however , be an excuse for UNK inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution .    2.915391010281121
we intend shortly to issue a communication from the commission on precisely this question .    2.8783069303382054
i agree with parliament that the common position ' s sixteen - year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced .    2.4649734977355506
the same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years .    2.4111524461242273
amendment no 28 , cancelling the third extension period , is an important step in the right direction .    2.389831869081849
this proposal can therefore be approved .    2.650802695485655
a period of ten years , as proposed in amendments nos 24 and 26 , among others , is , on the other hand , too short .    3.2163095459147764
i believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided .    2.6440870087806516
the proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water .    2.1176495190735607
this applies to amendments nos 6 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 78 , 80 , 102 and 104 .    2.123094594077197
these amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found .    2.422519834959491
to comply with the demands in amendments nos 27 and 29 , to the effect that the commission should approve every extension , would be going too far , and these cannot be approved .    3.1956213180373165
another important area is protection of the groundwater .    3.011287050620688
we need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution .    2.517684197218703
we also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring .    2.4838252820601867
the most important parts of parliament ' s amendments nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle .    2.630292968053751
the new definition in amendment no 72 is , however , too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose .    2.8857397712164263
i would propose that amendment no 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution .    2.4559192885488463
amendment no 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater .    2.78367629071662
the proposal cannot therefore be approved .    2.657005598689531
the commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality .    2.2075932390217505
instead , we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with article 11 to promote activities in this area .    2.7343498811223528
the good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled .    2.424232873698319
this part of amendment no 41 cannot , therefore , be approved .    2.9447645503030806
the commission appreciates parliament ' s efforts to guarantee that the so - called combined approach is given a central role .    3.158693881585182
this approach and its scope , which the commission can in principle approve , are defined by amendments nos 22 and 47 .    2.736136095830088
in order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality , we wish , however , to UNK amendment no 47 and to add a de minimis provision .    2.9598778600959257
the transfer of water is already covered by controls , but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer .    2.492561605991317
these parts of amendments nos 49 and 87 can , therefore , be approved .    2.3781345085288086
it is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted .    2.691221456728396
the proposal already specifies that water must be UNK in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned .    2.4356022513333766
these parts of amendments nos 49 and 87 cannot , therefore , be approved .    2.333344314024918
the commission approves amendment no 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal .    2.521612235249351
to summarise , the commission is able to approve 72 amendments , either in their entirety , partially or in principle .    2.4556145629299935
the following amendments cannot be approved : 1 , 4 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 19 , 23 , 39 , 40 , 51 , 59 , 61 , 64 , 66 , 70 , 71 , 71 , 72 , 74 , 77 , 79 , 81 , 83 , 87 , 89 , 90 , 91 , 95 , 97 , 98 , 100 , 101 , 103 , 106 and 107 .    1.6387571607890266
finally , i want to say that i welcome the efforts which parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the council takes other views .    3.46959750459399
important progress has been made , and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions .    2.979957955445568
a number of obstacles remain , but i am convinced that , as the legislative work progresses , we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of .    3.2582101938468413
parliament ' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious , european water policy for the next three decades .    2.8243282955284537
i would like to hear the commissioner ' s view on amendment no 45 .    3.0434869089522905
i may have missed it in the list she gave out .    2.8608711486262526
. i accept that .    3.0981235609996998
thank you , mrs wallström .    2.414120511966361
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 30 p . m .    1.7964621698279897
financial instrument for the environment ( life )    3.3444373670204715
the next item is the recommendation for second reading ( a4 - 0014 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy on the common position adopted by the council with a view to adopting a european parliament and council regulation on a financial instrument for the environment ( life ) ( rapporteur : mrs lienemann ) .    2.329195047023659
rapporteur .    3.5682625201043643
( fr ) mr president , we have already had the opportunity , at the first reading , to examine this report and i was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this house .    3.4056612323645874
life is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the community budget , and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been UNK for years . despite the enlargement which has already taken place , when we renewed the first life programme to move on to the second , despite enlargement , the level of appropriations remained the same .    3.0177931350285543
and then we see that , increasingly , the regions , the various operators , businesses , associations , are submitting life projects , both for life - nature and life - environment , projects that are of excellent quality , which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of european union support , but we still cannot fund them , for lack of budget appropriations .    2.4193205843561674
it must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the community budget .    2.4657126463353447
patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement .    2.9367556252760205
i would stress the life - nature strand in particular .    2.4827910134512052
we are well aware that , in the european union , a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation . with life - nature we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility , the validity of the objectives of these directives , and their capacity to be implemented .    3.260535024893165
and , for want of appropriations , we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these european directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop .    2.283001063631681
but we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the european union ' s financial programmes and instruments .    3.244152173344982
i would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget .    2.970461635708633
i feel , at any rate , that for the ultimate application of life , at least , there would be some way for the union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment .    3.34169732179177
let me conclude with the matter of our institutions ' way of working .    2.8756213384577554
this is the essence of how i understand the situation : we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly , that , basically , the members of parliament should drop their claims , particularly claims on the budget , for if we do not soon , in line with the codecision procedure , get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for life , then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay , and in the meantime the ngos and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations .    2.920872684060322
i would , however , like to point out that the council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date .    3.0678754019172674
as for us , we our bound by the terms of the texts : a maximum of four months .    2.81523127803173
we meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others , because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time .    2.8551805809113704
i think parliament often protests about this method , not to point the finger at any specific party within the council , and i certainly would not want the portuguese presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs , since , the truth is , it is something of a tradition , which the council has kept going for a long time .    3.1282346262691756
but i should like to stress the fact that , on this issue of the environment , the budget issue is a central one and parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal .    3.6299594130150394
i therefore hope , firstly , that our fellow members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the council and the commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other .    3.2158657094478866
mr president , it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the council and the commission , and i will refer to this later on .    3.6773110596154255
it is equally true , however , that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering life i and life ii .    2.9691855597021983
it is better firstly because the framework proposal made life i more rigorous , more transparent and more rational .    2.2529660137890004
secondly , it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations , which were advocated by the european parliament at first reading . specifically , these are : to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects , and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination .    2.980936561763091
this is one of the aims that life - environment must achieve . thirdly , the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of life - environment ' s priorities is an extremely positive step .    3.073185206440857
by persisting with their proposal of eur 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004 , and by refusing to accept the european parliament ' s proposal of eur 850 million , the commission and the council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of UNK and justice that they introduced , and rightly so , for other measures in life iii .    3.1405439167687947
we want the commission and the council to know that we will not give up trying to provide life with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument .    3.1976867672318567
we have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice .    2.153690071366307
firstly , life is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the european union .    2.755866907076349
there is no other such policy .    2.6706510884912498
secondly , life is an instrument that has already produced good results , and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation .    2.4798205621775744
thirdly , the life budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand .    2.2420983180210206
fourthly , as parliament UNK so much value to life , it has allocated ever - greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget .    2.370655072565241
this means that approving the proposal put forward by the council and by the commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend .    3.2327888850587727
our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue , however .    2.289515341235337
climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the european public and which have deserved considerable attention from this house .    2.695733109410672
we therefore feel it is crucial that as amendments nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which life - environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water , as well as for reducing greenhouse gases , they should be adopted .    2.4928811083770497
lastly , i would like to congratulate mrs lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though , as was made clear in the committee on the environment , we would prefer life to have been monitored by an advisory committee , we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the council to be accepted as quite frankly , it was worse .    3.3910640831291796
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , life is the european union ' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment .    2.5848997620592695
that explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions , ambitions for which , of course , there is a price .    2.7672151768653155
obviously , the basic item for discussion with the council will be the allocation for life iii .    3.210998494304696
the common position stipulates a total appropriation of eur 613 million for the period 2000 - 2004 . this is not enough .    3.028975619038424
the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party is in favour of increasing this amount to eur 850 million .    2.497602452582891
we therefore support mrs lienemann ' s amendment which observes that the allocation for life was not increased when the union was last enlarged , without even mentioning the next UNK of new UNK .    2.058196841301891
the amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure .    2.7832763436449546
a drop in the ocean , i might say , in comparison with europe ' s structural policies .    3.043952711962782
the environment is still the poor relation in the european budget , even though it is primarily an investment .    3.320078932491743
an investment in natural resources , of course , but also in employment , since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs , as shown particularly by the great success of life , a success with ngos , businesses , local authorities and third countries .    2.9795430383770722
more than one third of the 8 , 500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to UNK approximately 1 , 300 projects between 1992 and 1998 .    2.3690503457317065
a success which parliament wishes and intends to see UNK , and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the life project .    2.731052627337033
in matters of the environment , investment and ambition come in a variety of forms , and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term .    2.610852293509329
this is the price of the future of generations to come .    3.1486564478585044
mr president , commissioner , i am probably going to repeat things my fellow members have said but i believe that , as far as the council is concerned , the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of life .    3.0044974937813707
i shall therefore reiterate that , as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly , life is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the european union ' s policy on the environment .    3.5179676545215175
this instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in europe , which are adopted and UNK upon by the member states .    3.12222799232213
this financial instrument is , furthermore , deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non - governmental organisations .    2.3892802944355407
that is why , ladies and gentlemen , i would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of life .    3.085045952948218
through the associations , then , life is a facility that can be used by the european citizen directly , and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community .    3.7114135837543003
several million ngo members - millions , i say - recognise in life the union ' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage .    2.606986561894275
life is , moreover , the fundamental instrument of the natura 2000 network in europe into which the member states have put a lot , pursuant to community directives on the habitats of rare and UNK fauna and flora and on migratory birds , and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our states .    2.5974230909644938
i should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own states bear the responsibility for obstructing european nature conservation policies .    2.5312431205374155
this is a pity because everyone within this chamber knows that life is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by member states , a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds .    2.799348682349721
let us not forget that , to date , life amounts to only eur 100 million per annum , i . e . scarcely 0 . 1 % of the budget of the european union .    2.4663085899157196
against this background , my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to life and unreservedly supports mrs lienemann ' s proposal to increase the budget to eur 850 million , since we know , and i think it bears saying , how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the council ' s compromise regarding the budget for life is , especially as the life programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice .    2.696817409683895
the first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those .    2.388183980223169
mr president , the european union environmental programme , to which a considerable amount ( eur 613 million ) has been allocated , gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds .    2.5598650012187987
a financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective , and this is not the case for the following reasons : poorly defined selection criteria , dubious uncoordinated operations , assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy .    2.495460984584572
we are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows .    2.642535309870066
firstly , to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to life funds exclusively to public bodies , subsequently , following invitation to tender , to UNK the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations .    2.2555629651567153
it is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions , since private law associations may disappear or UNK acquisitions .    2.1801562633639127
it is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100 % public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership , even under cover of environmental protection .    2.1355781635858238
secondly , to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of life funds , in order to rule our any suspicions of UNK or UNK .    2.718959842420352
thirdly , to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite .    2.694700166674045
for example , the life - nature project in france , at grand - UNK lake , planned without any coordination , led to a real ecological disaster , the de - silting operation which was carried out without regard for french law on the subject caused significant silting of the UNK , a water course located downstream , destroying spawning beds , UNK UNK , and who knows what else .    2.4454842754660544
the UNK was in fact shifted 3 kilometres , at a cost of ff 6 million , the cure being worse than the disease , and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site .    2.3159296399922513
result : a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself .    2.689473549224877
this is the sort of thing that we want to avoid .    3.315744683191092
four , to include representatives of parliament in the monitoring committee , at least one member per political group .    2.926335315022271
what could be fairer than for members of parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for ?    3.006061106852138
fifthly , to publish an annual scientific , technical and financial assessment of life operations carried out .    2.283307977184884
six , to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis .    3.0052427865356974
seven , to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency : for example , in reforestation following storm damage , or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick , etc .    2.973471412372356
here , mrs lienemann , mr president , we are putting forward here a practical proposal , a common sense proposal , easy to implement , likely to limit local conflicts and to UNK the proper use of public monies , before increasing the life budget line by as much as 40 % !    2.6205291930180157
mr president , commissioner , i would firstly like to congratulate mrs lienemann on the report she has carried out , and also the commission - why not ? - because this report , this position , generally improves on the texts in force .    2.8745779115113987
furthermore , it contains more acceptable UNK and is clearer and more transparent .    2.2796934974816216
i would also like to congratulate the services of the commission , since the evaluation , control and monitoring of the life programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects .    2.9206354950705307
however , i would like to insist on certain points .    2.553117698206532
firstly , its continuity , which , in principle , i am not questioning .    3.5912356114042083
secondly , the financial contributions .    3.154508543922541
sadly , only 7 . 2 % of the projects requested receive funds .    3.017029284745537
of the eur 1 UNK million requested , only eur UNK million have been granted .    2.582521920712352
now the financial statement shows only eur 613 million to cover more countries and competences .    2.2516415027898153
parliament has proposed eur 850 million , but the document repeats the initial proposal of eur 613 million .    2.824054491633454
commissioner , our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas , while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing .    2.8815562175844303
let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves ?    3.0783832864201566
why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us , but rather expect the usual people , the ones who live there all year , to pay for it and maintain it ?    2.643045310490297
commissioner , we must be consistent .    4.016317327109781
the cost of maintaining the environment , which we all enjoy , must be met by all of us , and the life programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective .    3.5264805183600134
mr president , life has been the principal instrument available to the community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy , both within the community and in the surrounding third countries .    2.9619948482970933
on the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years , an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument .    2.936862427233613
the funding of activities for the implementation , adaptation and development of community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies , particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development , are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon .    2.9748331701875363
an important element of life - nature , which mainly concerns the realisation of the natura 2000 network , is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities , so as to avoid the fragmentation of UNK and to offer better protection of biodiversity .    2.5619043965803296
in the second , life - environment strand , which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium - sized enterprises and local government agencies , the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed .    2.70921030853905
as regards the financing package for the implementation of life over the next five years , i wholeheartedly support the increase from eur 613 million to eur 850 million proposed by the rapporteur , mrs lienemann .    2.944409181611507
unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection , there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years , and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies .    2.940802102261192
besides , we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries .    2.271350500360412
what has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the danube and its tributary has been instructive .    2.527163520868459
consequently , i consider that support for environmental action under the life financial instrument will help to further community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the community ' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement .    2.595758862596341
mr president , i should like to begin by congratulating mrs lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment , ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening .    2.4340656190172414
two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic .    3.1619732130733547
so i will simply appeal to the commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue .    3.1302594353607196
for five years , i have been the representative of the committee on the environment in a regional organisation , which assuredly does not have parliament ' s broad perspective .    3.9272738031046934
the environment is in a UNK state .    3.719885554738439
like a number of previous speakers , i , too , wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects , which , in my view , should be incorporated into the UNK domain .    3.5622781492395017
as regards funding , eur 613 million is not enough . even eur 850 million is not enough .    2.5184388246449982
at the end of august 1999 , i took part in a meeting of the committee of the environment in which it was said that eur 2 million , or itl 4 000 billion , should go towards eliminating or , at any rate , reducing smoking .    2.5925354020916
however , the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking .    2.2509538819359682
eur 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me , is not enough , in practical terms , to allow any type of project to be carried out .    2.730140257603225
in many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the life programme have been established .    2.6931358224685544
but creating parks with very limited financial resources , without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual .    2.177858213194467
i would therefore ask parliament and the commission to give the matter their full attention .    2.934904008385756
i would again thank the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and mrs lienemann for the good and constructive co - operation we have had on this matter .    2.53636391710194
the commission welcomes , above all , amendments nos 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 13 , which apply to the committee procedures .    2.5249163893199165
in these cases , parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the commission had to the common position .    3.3967026287110604
the commission can , in principle , also approve amendment no 4 which ought , however , to be introduced into another place in the text .    3.522384291353761
with regard to amendments nos 5 and 6 , i want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water , together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect , are to a large degree covered by life .    2.537950305467898
the commission nonetheless considers that , if this is stated separately , then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas .    2.9354103172852692
there is also a risk of overlap with other community programmes such as the fifth framework programme for research , technical development and demonstration .    2.6488878316382363
the present programme ' s key measures - water quality , tomorrow ' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions .    2.3740942485717085
where the question of the budget is concerned , i am pleased about the confidence shown by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .    3.2205780321752218
amendment no 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position .    2.368542622734587
this instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget .    2.1887079179220303
the amount quoted in amendment no 12 does not , however , UNK with the budget set on the basis of agenda 2000 .    3.3435787125240486
allow me also to add that , if the budget is increased , greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the directorate - general for the environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with .    3.0704938451477384
account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision - making procedure .    3.70403220884083
at this stage , the commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position .    3.3664784216076886
with regard to amendment no 3 , which we did not approve at first reading , i want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives , conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid .    2.893903471642285
it is therefore meaningless , and often impossible , directly to transfer projects from life to other instruments .    2.0770214596785843
if other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project , more resources would , moreover , be required than are available in the present situation .    2.5605509910442317
nor can the commission approve amendment no 14 , which is contrary to the commission ' s right of initiative .    3.971681013919608
with regard to the discussion concerning the deadline , i want to say that the final date for beginning to implement life - 31 march 2000 , as set in the common position - must now be moved forward .    2.6711622284364056
the date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted .    2.8033580926873616
finally , i want to repeat that i am convinced that life will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the community ' s environmental policy .    3.4099270762639655
i am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible , especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the member states and in other countries , especially among the applicant states which are now being given the opportunity to participate in life .    3.523696074591315
thank you , mrs wallström .    2.414120511966361
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 30 a . m .    1.7247001005060476
modernising social protection    4.295379255338738
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0033 / 2000 ) , by mr andersson on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs , on the communication from the commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [ com ( 1999 ) 347 - c5 - 0253 / 1999 - 1999 / 2182 ( cos ) ] .    2.2044381993430755
mr president , the issue of social security systems is an important one .    3.350859493423638
this is a natural consequence of cooperation within the eu .    2.7906958703958566
the basis is monetary cooperation , which has since been followed up by macro - economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy .    2.663986784278732
it is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems .    2.7777796643881567
these areas are mutually dependent upon one another .    2.3799988148302034
economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment .    2.5889842469627853
it also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision .    2.9223015191768207
in other words , social security is a factor of production .    2.850657473610114
social security systems differ from one eu country to another .    2.7169950038636417
this is largely due to historical factors .    2.440251519038239
we are now faced with a number of common challenges , however ; demographic development , for example , which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate .    3.121791322203233
women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers .    2.5016311322302736
another challenge is presented by technical development .    2.5014373264510636
we must meet these challenges together .    2.532813710177534
the commission ' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared , a high - level group formed and benchmarking introduced .    2.27832462393768
what is more , the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment .    3.086871143586107
this is good , but it is not enough .    3.264389396083381
we propose a procedure like the luxembourg process .    2.5328628043046773
clear guidelines and indicators are required . at the same time , the member states are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans .    2.7798046955280604
we are creating a common model , but retaining the principle of subsidiarity .    2.4831077333945233
this social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period .    2.9436719020866158
parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high - level group , but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on .    3.42168234529555
like the work on employment , the commission ' s proposal is founded upon four pillars .    3.2224958647169784
all this is important .    3.434479109191122
equality has no pillar of its own .    2.8777675106567537
all four pillars should reflect aspects of equality .    2.4094251420297454
this is something we have borne in mind .    2.8790038359227066
we are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect , for example , that there should be a transition to UNK social security systems ; that UNK leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems ; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life ; and that the basic old - age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living .    2.7010398219221794
these proposals favour women especially .    2.552817587595187
parallel to this european strategy of social convergence , a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required , together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees , accompanied by a concrete timetable .    2.544221865033626
we expect the commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme .    3.490122553938891
social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the union , partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping .    3.077082126330775
the commission ought to consider UNK a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement .    2.564648119855246
we have had a constructive discussion in the committee .    3.090189433161143
we had a lot of amendments , but succeeded in agreeing upon a report .    2.8069013348079674
now , the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen .    2.806078940763515
this indicates that we have a broad consensus .    4.020624617514786
a number of these amendments have come back from the committee reading , and these i shall reject .    2.9179871465078455
i shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the technical group of independent members , because i do not think that these add anything to the report .    3.0062355461598043
on the other hand , my group will applaud amendment no 14 from the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party .    2.255845477150361
i think this proposal is a good one .    3.2734285762076105
certainly , it resembles amendment no 1 , but amendment no 14 is better .    2.414114245296561
finally , i want to say that the eu is not only concerned with cooperation on trade .    3.376464852490537
the eu is also a union for employment and social justice .    3.6932525130363416
in creating a citizens ' europe , social policy has an important role to play .    2.477228343483763
by means of this report , parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of european society .    2.970725872962177
the lisbon summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind .    2.976611432686302
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr andersson , very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion .    2.668875812511135
in the capacity of coordinator of the european people ' s party in the committee on employment and social affairs , i am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which mr andersson put so much effort into .    2.8719336854619137
i am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report .    2.3982005929367842
the goal of the commission ' s notification of june 1999 , on which the andersson report is based , is to reinforce cooperation between the member states and the eu in terms of social protection .    4.083316017931776
key sub - goals are : promoting employment and ensuring that work UNK a fixed income ; secondly , safeguarding old - age pensions and making these affordable ; thirdly , promoting social integration and fourthly , guaranteeing affordable , first - rate health protection .    2.0427120544315733
gender - related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals .    2.448603172213316
i believe that congratulations are also in order for the commission with regard to this notification , for these four points are , in fact , to a very large number of eu citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought .    3.1826504758356826
the commission ' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about european social convergence .    2.500983291647667
the commission has recognised this UNK .    2.6819430387776366
it is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is , of course , underpinned by a sound macro - economic strategy and a sound employment strategy .    2.4431093632361245
these aspects are very much interconnected .    2.9652428207539607
it is , therefore , surprising that this topic has , to date , not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the commission ' s notification constitutes a break - through in a way .    3.031843518773168
it brings me great UNK to witness that the council now seems to accept this break - through and also wants to bring it to the fore in lisbon .    2.518809334679365
we should , of course , not get overly UNK about it .    2.80318773766592
it marks the beginning , rather than the end , of a process .    3.674818300080795
some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue .    2.598095892805389
but it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion .    3.1407372207513524
the issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the european union are quite different from one another .    3.210321765153694
the challenges are different .    2.7551965863783177
the levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling UNK but to make steady progress nonetheless .    2.9328426305557347
in this way , we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges .    3.651808568695423
the majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen .    3.162580825953888
the UNK thing about the andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape ; from this perspective it is not a pie - in - the - sky report .    2.617420008618282
it is a report which tries to give direction .    2.6796955406861187
there are , however , one or two aspects about which i have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific .    3.3363168186509715
i think that a number of meps will make reference to this .    3.1123760915194465
but that does not take away from the fact that the report ' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in lisbon .    3.776968504289779
i believe that if it were to be adopted in lisbon in this way , lisbon will turn out to be a success .    3.3735336025771985
if it is not adopted , lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past .    3.1682765346283137
as far as this is concerned , the report , albeit a component , may well be the key component of lisbon , because it is really innovative , while many other things are merely a UNK of what has been said before .    3.1008117874452035
all in all , i am indebted to the rapporteur and the committee for this report .    3.862465349137341
i hope that europe , in terms of social protection , will make a step forward , taking into account subsidiarity , for without subsidiarity , this would not be possible .    3.1897589593402005
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , like my fellow mep , UNK pronk , please allow me to thank the commission for this communication and , in particular , to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report .    3.0211315810392687
commissioner , the fact that this report is no longer controversial within parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance .    3.776931259643128
there have been times within this parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward .    2.4689487646907775
it is also a timely discussion - as mr pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the lisbon summit , which intends to find out how we can put economic growth , employment and social cohesion on the agenda in europe via the information society .    2.5756018939544423
within my group , it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in lisbon .    2.698890548334243
my group is pleased that the social affairs council gave the go - ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that , in fact , a group of high - ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the council an initial report by june 2000 .    2.8153300412952444
however , we , the parliament and , in particular , the group of the social democrats , want lisbon to go one step further now .    3.058961850955363
it is of great importance that , in our fellow mep ' s report , this european parliament advocates a true european strategy of social convergence , based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so - called luxembourg strategy , that is to say it should UNK common goals , guidelines , national action plans and performance evaluations .    2.721730569904141
we believe that this course of action is ambitious , yet achievable .    2.580850242782217
needless to say , it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at european level .    3.091673681453426
the financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this , and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the european agenda , and why , in fact , scenarios such as UNK UNK ' UNK member state or the european social snake have scarcely got off the ground .    2.9710872305387523
but this new course of action is very exciting .    2.584295375248559
the employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary , for our social security systems are facing the same challenges , and in an emu era , social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition .    2.5824379557616766
but let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group : social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation .    2.8079744422419073
they can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the commission in terms of social legislation .    3.320449522071851
i think that it also a good thing if , moreover , the european parliament tried to convince the council to UNK the common strategy as early on as in lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001 .    2.8343020320110623
i am pleased about the fact that the european parliament supports my group ' s idea and we hope , commissioner , that we can also count on your support .    3.5579083617995937
finally , we urge the european parliament , both sides of industry and social ngos to be closely involved in this process .    2.877470904075758
the success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support .    2.678715581844204
mr president , the four chief objectives which the eu countries ' governments endorsed in november of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows : that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income ; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable ; that social integration should be promoted ; and that sustainable , high - quality health care should be guaranteed .    2.370076978537867
these are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them . having a group of high - ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from .    2.5013476842286813
the commission ' s communication , which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the council in november , is a well - balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the member states in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the union .    3.131271547199143
we now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets , which is a problem for many member states .    2.569852501756555
if reforms are not got under way , we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy , and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security .    2.902176308326773
it is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda .    2.3929495922403055
in the debate about coordination of social policy in the eu , we often use the expression social convergence .    3.589905905183185
as liberals , we can support this concept when it means that we in the eu are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies .    2.9491465142956717
it is not , therefore , about harmonisation but about common objectives .    2.572113394903337
it is , of course , a fact that the eu countries have different ways of organising social policy .    3.1008504095218923
national policy is , of course , subject to a number of common parameters . that is the case with minimum social entitlements , which are established by treaty .    3.426466868006636
it is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements . it applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies ; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation .    2.624214974970964
so coordination and cooperation are facts of life . but convergence should be about goals , not means .    2.2358468457139904
i should also like to thank the rapporteur , jan andersson , for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report .    2.555212644650538
i can support the report , but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste .    3.747541237770264
i do not agree with the requirement that the commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems , if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient , or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many eu countries .    2.739910501946089
i am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the commission ' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly , and i am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold .    2.9328062281912146
mr president , commissioner , with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security , i would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me .    2.9492068233978745
i feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier .    2.6858363135191126
this seems to be a good thing and useful .    3.7054188550466525
i also feel positive about the essence of the communication , namely the strategic approach .    2.7995232825320473
we therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved .    2.5604252151060733
we would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled . on the one hand , it would be useful to have guidelines and a process UNK on luxembourg , but we also think it is important , as is already mentioned by mrs van lancker , that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios , such as sole traders , etc .    2.866849865284516
we nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found .    2.902294916159825
the first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security , which , we hope , will be replaced by high - level convergence .    3.2434361466528183
it appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments , in fact , the majority of them , appear to be downward adjustments , the remainder being improvements .    2.548894311021388
the lion ' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans : eleven restrictions and two improvements .    2.0062796491125243
in the case of unemployment benefits , we came across six restrictions and five improvements .    2.2451134867062796
the reasons for adjustments are , for example , to improve employment , reduce social security expenditure , but are also due to policy competition and emu criteria .    2.579652942936781
policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries .    2.629605323990685
the highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries .    2.9347901826309624
all in all , both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole .    2.709503859606789
this is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches .    2.7770781244669784
to use a figure of speech , UNK is not always good for us .    3.037438195297159
mr president , i would , in turn , like to congratulate both the commission , for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security , and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled .    3.8091379002817134
the european union ' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy .    3.2236975851432743
so far , social policy has remained limited in terms of set - up and resources .    2.8649281757649256
but under the influence of the free movement of employees , of the internal market and of the euro , the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated .    3.3621519348516524
cross - border workers , employees on UNK and UNK employees , as well as job - seekers , students on placement and other students , experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement . this is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection .    2.9758154828356917
in fact , the same phenomenon occurs in tax law .    2.4843376906072328
in order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping , the commission has , in my opinion , developed a well - balanced approach which UNK a UNK between harmonisation and non - intervention .    3.0288645439185595
on the one hand , binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old - age pensions and on the other hand , programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non - discrimination or social exclusion .    2.4131828810184768
based on a number of recommendations , reports and communications , the commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high - ranking officials .    2.892569002672591
both proposals have already been accepted by the council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time , with knowledge of all facts and / or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be UNK in the european union .    3.510239330772339
indeed , expansion , globalisation , a sharp increase in the ageing population , UNK and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable .    2.3299647622448885
denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection .    2.2514418269458822
with regard to eurosceptics and nationalists , i would say that social protection within the boundaries of a member state is not social and offers no protection .    2.657004451114096
indeed , if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition , this would also harm social protection as a production factor .    2.727210534775544
in respect of the super - europeans , i would say that european social protection is neither UNK nor desirable .    2.742016537274485
the discrepancies between the member states are too immense in terms of provisions , rightful UNK , revenue or benefits , etc . it is thus impossible to bring all states into line .    2.8759613922261984
the path which the commission is walking is , in fact , obvious .    3.61368943628422
it has the advantage of clarity , and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and UNK tune solid , UNK indicators and put forward recommendations .    2.5930503800818814
i endorse this view .    2.849904680232039
i will give my support to the commission and i hope that lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter .    3.3182631539692506
mr president , mr andersson ' s report contains a lot that is of interest .    2.785010054205801
unfortunately , what is most interesting is that the report , which UNK to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy , instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere .    3.1434963636755557
social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the member states .    3.6497780616524107
even though the socialists , now that there are so many social democratic governments , talk much less about unemployment than they used to , the unemployment in question is still high , and this in spite of the trade boom .    2.903524968460385
something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so - called european model into a UNK .    2.453552124467246
social policy must facilitate employment , creating incentives for employers and employees to , respectively , provide and accept jobs .    2.116159153896475
mr andersson ' s report demands social convergence , that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the eu .    2.8702414670863097
the eu should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria , which would be binding and of real effect .    2.500181168279379
the eu should also , on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds , table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the member states .    2.386060964289863
the eu should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created , whatever that may mean .    2.9041697038101426
it is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference .    3.185559841989721
those structural problems which make unemployment higher in europe than in the united states will become even greater .    2.5468441683160057
there is no need at all for supranationalism in this area .    2.5289794969058743
the member states can devise their own systems in the social sphere , each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences .    2.9824566017259677
it is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the eu .    2.478111884945537
mr andersson thinks that the less wealthy eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too .    2.3874407786828584
it is obvious , however , that these countries , impoverished within a communist economic system , cannot cope with a social policy like , for example , sweden ' s .    2.7380609504092246
talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present member states and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant states are concerned .    2.7673293967383863
mr president , as others have done , i should also like to congratulate mr andersson for the report he has produced .    3.073500405091136
he has done a great deal of work on behalf of parliament in producing a wide - ranging consensus on what is , by any definition , a thorny issue , not just in this parliament but in virtually every member state .    3.0612307777023773
i also welcome the commission ' s communication .    3.055652103031822
it was slow in coming but well worth waiting for .    2.2878726063968275
it could be a UNK in the development of a social europe , providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual member states to UNK at the steps that must be taken to implement it .    3.5528068537284003
we can , and must , take the unique european social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty - first century , a century which is globalising fast .    2.262631616246854
i am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by mr UNK schmid will not deal with that globalising world .    2.6908557644376354
to be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy , our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense , are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole .    3.048577487458808
we have to ensure that our ecofin ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in europe which is creative , has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens .    2.860056502750599
this is not an option for us any more .    2.5857314838425367
it is an imperative .    2.8517695934371488
european citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings .    2.48196374342056
we do not want the us model - a model which has UNK failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life .    2.6475789099925935
what it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the united states .    2.900610292191414
that is not what we want to do in europe .    3.576944848952249
we have the traditions of solidarity in europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things .    3.5105921408834395
but we have to grasp the tools to do that .    3.1149086698012636
i therefore urge that we not only implement the high - level group as proposed by the commission but also go further and have a luxembourg - type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection .    2.945918419941179
mr president , commissioner , this is one of the social areas to which the european union ought to pay much more attention .    3.4257827451971665
macroeconomic policies , the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people ' s lives , specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes , particularly of the minimum pensions , and through fighting social exclusion .    2.659966279180094
this situation is particularly serious in countries such as portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn , is the lowest in the whole of europe .    2.651911392684775
therefore , while the commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality , with employee rights , which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid , public social protection system , we harbour serious doubts as to its position .    2.7188779258609737
although the andersson report has gathered some positive proposals , including some that we put forward ourselves , we are still critical of some of the bases for the commission ' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection .    2.9636431968220345
mr president , in my previous life i ran two manufacturing businesses , one in the united kingdom and one in the netherlands .    2.7674729204545274
as the uk business grew , we invested in more people , as the dutch business grew we invested in more machinery .    2.3255394087799512
the simple reason for this was that social costs in the netherlands were just too high in comparison .    2.6399817357909052
i am in favour of social protection , i am in favour of the original commission document , but i do not want to see people UNK out of jobs because social protection costs become UNK high .    3.2740743951092877
that is why in committee i proposed some form of business impact assessment , so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account , and the epp - de group supported this amendment .    2.7349646958136464
but i must record that other groups , led by the pse group , guided by my countryman , UNK UNK , voted this out .    2.450678928326886
i accept that mr andersson ' s report is very well - intentioned , and i respect him for the work he has done , but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the eu .    2.8983834545475244
this would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this house by showing how remote we are from the real world .    2.420402410485037
i therefore urge this house to reject the full report and let the original commission proposal , which was very well - balanced , stand UNK .    2.7014647153620577
mr president , we are unable to vote for this report .    2.8615860059092406
the european union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of europe .    2.622063459153262
social rights should determine economic choices , and not the other way around .    2.807300919112677
this is why , when it comes to social protection , we are opposed to schemes copied from the luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale : broad economic guidelines , then convergence criteria and , finally , social issues , dealt with as the last resort .    2.5128627703587325
the european union should proclaim one general principle , to wit , that the social rights acquired in member states may not be restricted .    3.029369955007129
any community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator .    2.3974181932851883
in order to strengthen the funding of social security systems , we need a policy of general wage increase , the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each member state .    3.1872536538829483
in order to fight poverty , entitlement to an income and to employment are UNK rights .    2.304350191295917
finally , in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity , the european union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system .    2.9131979865003275
i sincerely hope , in conclusion , that social europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes .    2.3723501785069208
for millions of people the situation is too tragic for that .    2.747988328569242
mr president , commissioner , the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the european union is certainly an UNK one . just as the launching of a european convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the luxembourg summit was commendable .    2.680346613747096
the labour market and social protection are , in fact , two sides of the same coin , that require harmonised policies and rules .    2.979937218693258
if the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment , flexibility and salary discipline , then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function , and vice versa .    2.6585747828767334
until recently , the european countries fixed , it could be said in an UNK way , the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets .    3.186566293667081
budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability .    2.4002223068698187
with the maastricht treaty and the single currency , budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to UNK UNK as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness .    2.589576459886302
the structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot , therefore , be UNK through budget deficits and trade .    2.956571299778314
that being the case , in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the union , and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level , it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic UNK , the so - called UNK UNK shocks .    2.8162745920279484
and therein lies the paradox .    2.6195217616913107
political and monetary convergence in europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems .    2.4157667775665987
but , at the same time , the single currency and the absence of labour mobility , as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy , force us into a situation of non - convergence in terms of salaries and welfare , in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels .    2.736382488975283
hypocrisy and fine - sounding words such as convergence , benchmarking , modernisation and concerted action are not going to UNK us from those contradictions .    2.333225992330003
either the european union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources , genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes , or it would be better not to deceive and be UNK by hopeless UNK to convergence which sound impressive but which , in reality , only cause harm , above all to the most vulnerable .    2.6720904673787147
that is something we would do well to recognise .    2.671921314957604
mr president , unlike several of those who have spoken in today ' s debate , i am inclined to endorse the andersson report , one of the reasons for this being that i can see clear differences between the report and the commission ' s communications .    3.539118823980419
in particular , i am referring to the fact that this report - and i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the european social model ' s approach , which is one based on solidarity .    3.6481129457137698
i can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the european union , and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity - based revival of the european social state , model .    2.8092914277456664
all in all , though , i deem this report to be worthwhile .    2.711181556466894
mr president , i have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection , which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of europe .    3.4029994026617483
this message is contained in the excellent report by mr andersson .    2.997320571925119
europe , the european union , although it is very strong in economic and political terms , will remain UNK , weak and limited , perhaps inadequate , if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view .    3.147709368296199
i believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it , but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged .    3.151928698969765
bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income , i believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the european union .    3.0815218314512287
let us not forget that , in 1999 , UNK , 000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate .    2.8982175741077403
in social terms , it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience , as president UNK recently stated in spain .    3.412341535991734
we must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes , mergers , take - overs , new technologies etc .    2.418062239631223
what is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs , for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity , because sometimes , as the title of the film states , the postman always rings twice .    2.4561162300586035
in my humble opinion , it is the responsibility of all european , national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion .    3.3235585088166912
mr president , i should like to congratulate mr andersson on his really excellent work , which is the reason why there is broader agreement , and i also thank the members of parliament involved for their contribution .    3.151351459963004
i would like to make a number of comments about what has been said .    3.093491428940891
first , i must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the european bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled : " the future of social protection " and there have been statements from the european parliament , those of mrs UNK and mr pronk .    3.20468548696222
today , we have the statement by mr andersson .    3.7036519079195407
i believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection .    3.399889581500805
the second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the european commission can operate .    3.882944088700613
you know very well that the treaty provides no legal basis for policies at european level , but there is the agreement expressed at the last council , there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience , as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the member states .    3.0256864459615733
the third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses , which relate to paid work , the sustainability of pension systems , social convergence and lastly quality in health care , there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies .    2.570055713840424
as you know , a high - level group has already been set up by the portuguese presidency , which will present its first report to the summit conference in june .    3.224715085784918
the portuguese presidency has focused on two things : sustainable pension systems and social accession .    2.488562317114638
i believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high - level group .    2.585278982513659
concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems , the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the member states , i should like to say that in europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion .    3.210593620435378
of course , we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness , but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment .    3.190946800889238
i think the statement ' s content makes this clear .    2.5018899592622135
ladies and gentlemen , the aim is that in the next year , and after a unanimous decision by the council , we should progress to a first level of coordination , exchange of views , listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies .    3.0658506142775326
as many of the speakers have said , i believe a first important step has been taken .    3.86121399967191
already at the intergovernmental conference , social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and i believe we are in a new phase , in which social policy will , to a large extent , become a european policy .    3.3601659087578613
thank you , mrs diamantopoulou .    2.308029410005412
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 30 a . m .    1.7247001005060476
wipo treaty    3.974495943605588
the next item is the recommendation ( a5 - 0008 / 2000 ) by mrs cederschiöld , on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , on the proposal for a council decision on the approval , on behalf of the european community , of the wipo copyright treaty and the wipo performances and phonograms treaty [ com ( 1998 ) 249 - c5 - 0222 / 1999 - 1998 / 0141 ( avc ) ] .    2.25233045376231
mr president , we are now taking a stance on an important issue , an international agreement , which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many member states .    2.690373411910637
in my own country , sweden , one of our biggest export industries is affected , namely the music and sound recording industry .    2.434736331616418
it is about artists ' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products .    2.0361907760932794
it is about the UNK ( world copyright treaty ) and the UNK ( world performance and phonograms treaty ) .    2.8239708579232223
without protection under intellectual property law , creativity is UNK and financial incentives obstructed .    2.3739903443031705
UNK are big business .    2.842491833877806
it is estimated that , in europe alone , income of eur 4 . 5 billion is lost because of UNK .    2.574227322508912
the problem affects a lot of jobs in the UNK industry .    3.7148975868410705
this is an historic agreement because the eu is the contracting party . this is the case , in spite of the fact that it is not the eu , but only the member states , which belong to the organisation .    3.7239256972829833
there exists a special clause which requires parliament ' s assent in two cases .    2.6342957165164407
with regard to the present agreement , both these conditions are fulfilled .    2.754279106325605
a new institution is being created , an assembly which , in the future , will monitor the agreement and its consequences .    2.861011339839418
the agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co - decision - making procedure .    2.9120536691243055
parliament must therefore give its assent , because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence .    2.6171839836360613
the future will show whether it is right , by means of this new parliamentary assembly , to reduce the commission ' s powers regarding these issues .    3.297681509788283
parliament cannot , in any case , at present do anything about the matter .    2.802681162377839
it creates international legal protection in connection with distribution , sale , rental , public reproduction and the making available of works .    2.110496855159472
it also creates protection for UNK and databases .    2.485556852724331
for example , it has not been defined .    3.7144500640944202
this too has not been solved .    3.320999846574349
it is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition .    2.8914857433818395
if no definitions are provided in questions such as this , it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world , with no uniformity of approach .    2.710260909543057
that would not be a good thing .    3.7963572020833127
the question of UNK procedures is still to be resolved , too .    2.9804237129333124
parliament cannot change these details .    2.616960338118213
we can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands .    2.777961170643658
yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies .    2.9019706442680415
both myself , as rapporteur , and the committee think we ought to say yes .    3.3468766749766905
we have here an agreement which , in spite of its defects , constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright .    3.0945990548013675
we have of course discussed at length whether parliament and whether the eu should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law .    2.3887829795016984
i think they should have .    3.3183047231408187
however , there is still no community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of UNK , and there needs to be .    3.577127460504499
a european patent is in the UNK , and that is a good thing .    4.628513670057734
now , the union and the member states are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law .    3.78813381253236
it is good for us that we have the power to do this , in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied .    3.9519342443195096
in that way , we can act as a model for the applicant states .    3.567311339968632
we have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement .    2.629982303088117
i want to thank the commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the commission ' s officials , which has been quite excellent .    4.094400432308567
finally , i also want to thank this chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour .    2.5749984917421305
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mrs cederschiöld , on her very serious work .    2.40941076579366
she has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the world intellectual property organisation ' s treaties .    2.694070646499196
their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the european union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property .    2.6512790521181664
it is a fact that the road has been a long one , mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property .    2.923641009094691
the problem has been overcome .    2.8400077463471214
today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties : the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations , performances and phonograms .    2.526061801311355
as regards the first of these , it seems to provide an effective solution for the long - standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works , while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution , rental and the presentation of their works to the public .    2.616197503614164
as regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms , it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers , interpreters and artists for reproduction , distribution and rental to the public , and the right to fair UNK for radio UNK .    2.5571485216438368
in that context a UNK and important step forward is the treaty ' s treatment of the right of reproduction .    2.864194857761768
even though , as the commission says , the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development , it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created , performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the treaty of rome or even by the community directives .    2.492270522772304
interpreting article 7 of the treaty , we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in UNK , but also protection against UNK , whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary , and protection against any other form of production .    2.4872873668977347
it would be appropriate , however , for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future wipo work or the work of other diplomatic conferences .    2.970307384923274
first , there is the right of distribution as referred to in article 8 ( 1 ) .    3.315185496584793
the option accorded to states by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the treaty ' s most negative points , since there is nothing to prevent states from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right , a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists .    2.6780857057161573
as regards rental rights , on interpretation of article 9 , we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists , interpreters or performers , only if this is laid down by national legislation . i think this conflicts with article 13 .    2.3557690262214237
to conclude , i want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights .    2.3682102497109825
in the 21st century , the century of knowledge and the invisible economy , intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will , in many cases , be more important than traditional property .    2.574605794710365
we are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created , where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large .    2.797957120068976
mr president , i should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which , nonetheless , concludes that , as a community , our accession to these two wipo treaties must not UNK down to a mere institutional development , however important that may be , i . e . the opportunity for the european community and the wipo assembly to work together .    2.9047777621179036
this ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of europe .    3.106655202974887
however , an objective is emerging behind this issue of community accession , one i find as yet too theoretical but one that some member states , nonetheless , find too offensive .    2.34138788300782
this is the affirmation of a european cultural policy . in this connection , i expect our three institutions , parliament , the commission and the council , to be in agreement .    3.6416762528846904
cultural policy means , in particular , defending the role of the arts , recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards .    2.8678143094046837
in addition , at a time when europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights , there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is .    2.616549429004188
our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them .    2.688971669930662
mr president , commissioner , the adoption of the wipo agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society .    2.806148027456443
the agreements UNK the decades - old legacy of copyright , and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights .    2.1954472475152653
in the united states the wipo treaty has already entered into force , having been UNK into law by means of the digital millennium corporate act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the treaty by means of this legislation .    2.8023340791115694
the eu too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the wipo .    2.775108232546887
it is worrying that the position adopted by the previous parliament does not support this balanced wipo system .    2.7187241675424656
the opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted , and , furthermore , the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of europeans .    2.8492357429711537
the recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in europe , on the contrary .    3.8109127401277516
parliament ' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old , in excess of 80 % market share to a new environment with rigid , excessive copyright regulations .    2.2466844527428185
i am not now speaking of charlotte cederschiöld ' s recommendation , which is an excellent paper , but of the matters of copyright that the previous parliament discussed .    2.728364423020729
on one point of detail , i would like to thank mrs cederschiöld for having clarified , for example , the concept of so - called temporary copies in her opinion .    2.870629805123248
there is no UNK adopted position in the wipo treaty on temporary copies .    2.55463316410984
if these , which technically speaking are copies , were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason .    2.2101328169609813
it would be as if the UNK had to pay a copyright UNK whenever he carried a book to be read by the UNK .    2.4257971441880533
the real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the UNK directly to the user , the consumer .    2.2243354353565437
the new operational environment is , above all , a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before .    2.586035825309997
it is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account .    2.7332896687785677
parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation .    3.176205956704942
. ( nl ) mr president , i would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out .    2.9312803099628315
the commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively .    2.920299927695507
this is important .    2.7456600740448183
it befits the commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur .    3.1011138716242685
i would like to present the commission ' s conclusion to you without any further UNK : it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and , therefore , with ratification by this parliament .    2.9700097377701713
i would like to stress the importance of both treaties .    2.6855358510875367
both the wipo copyright treaty and the wipo performances and phonograms treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are , as such , a considerable improvement on the berne convention and the treaty of rome .    2.474366387196579
both treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters , but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks .    2.4585528883235606
the two treaties explicitly permit the community to become a party to the treaties and to play an important role in managing them .    2.7475030855317977
consequently , approval of the treaties by the community is of major importance , because it illustrates that the community sets great store by intellectual property rights .    2.965608177751344
in addition , assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the european union ' s role in terms of copyright .    3.139633706321696
at international level , there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly .    3.081391276919279
these have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen wipo member states , including the united states .    2.973171039445527
the entry into force of treaties largely depends on the european union , because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect , and these acts that are signed by the european union and the member states , including associated countries , are of vital importance in order to reach this number .    3.0934024829213977
the developing countries , too , expect the european union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide .    3.339424774868674
in this context , parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the information society , which led to the approval of the UNK report in february 1999 .    3.1321217242271304
this directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the wipo treaties .    2.586825531823467
the european parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of article 300 ( 3 ) .    2.4572632729083135
it is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world , in the form of this recommendation .    3.3521822193097957
in a nutshell , i would like to reiterate the commission ' s conclusion here : it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property .    2.8015761289834744
thank you , commissioner .    2.120450226877885
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . UNK . m .    2.015036326245213
( the sitting was closed at 11 . 55 p . m . )    1.9310337406513665
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.588172984177108
the minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .    2.0123264391846676
are there any comments ?    2.1658741078678636
mr president , i see in the minutes that two members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to strasbourg on monday .    2.2329792040616905
i would like to add that the flight from amsterdam ' s UNK airport was also delayed and then cancelled .    2.2380579778045386
we were diverted to UNK - UNK airport .    2.987826592070182
we were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival .    2.0939768601483393
in fact , it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport .    2.0817735726977036
we finally got here , on monday at 8 . 30 p . m . , after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling .    2.2545054721284763
this sort of service and difficulty in getting to strasbourg on a monday is quite hopeless .    2.285505170256919
if the french government insists that we continue to meet in strasbourg , it could at least ensure , where flights are diverted to basle , that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted UNK , otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on monday and attend to any kind of business .    2.499563639975878
i wonder if that could be added to the minutes .    2.723548180832784
i hope that next time , also if any other airline company is involved , things will run more smoothly .    2.0898748199258192
( the minutes were approved )    2.0038305127267746
mr president , i would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today ' s agenda . we decided on monday that the council ' s statement on the UNK anniversary of the geneva convention was to be postponed .    2.830132658091806
i would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today , and not about the geneva convention .    3.3263860882762244
this item has been postponed until the next part - session in march .    2.432308730997574
it was UNK included in today ' s agenda .    2.579650703383164
mr swoboda , i can confirm what you have just said and there is , in fact , a printing error .    3.5756005021103148
the document that has been distributed contains UNK , because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate .    3.3912539572654845
mr president , i just want to say that , as i was walking in this morning , i noticed two people smoking outside the hemicycle .    2.6837148859710145
the smell is absolutely UNK !    2.621290588720064
can you please do something about it ?    2.771151406718364
i cannot do anything about it myself , but you are quite right . we need a quick way of educating people , including those who do not UNK the rules decided upon in this house .    2.9032737565493614
regarding the problems caused by air travel delays , perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching strasbourg for the present part - session should form a small group - although i am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered .    2.548380831107882
coherence of eu policies with development    3.1538435757899412
the next item is the statement by the council and the commission on the coherence of eu policies with development .    2.7409852308054568
mr president , it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the council presidency , particularly in view of the very important role that the european parliament is bound to play in the near future , given the need to strengthen development policies at european union level .    3.9212618066983413
the subject of the statement that i have the honour of presenting to you today , is the coherence of different union policies with development policy .    3.168157061534142
i shall , of course , give the commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that i shall be making . i would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel , at eu level , to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years , which has benefited people in all walks of life , throughout the world , in terms of well - being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that , at the same time , there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world .    3.1169830493892956
this UNK the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace .    3.1787927348933374
we are all therefore duty - bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet .    2.4247365038575666
the consequence of all this is a UNK of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets .    4.136215683726134
a serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged , which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments , which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies .    2.5267142186852354
we will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and i would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas :    2.7682749090031
firstly , there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players , by which i mean donors , requiring greater coordination , greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies ; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems .    2.1897644686046918
at the same time , however , there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate , particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems , together with a need to focus special attention on these countries ' own policies for reducing poverty .    2.7837022289145636
the second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development .    3.3421682415928196
this means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy , but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance , trade and investment . furthermore , this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries ' own policies .    2.740542348124152
a third aspect of this new model that i would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives .    3.018729001982196
since 1995 , following a concerted international effort between the main donor states , involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the oecd ' s development assistance committee , it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies , both at national and international level .    2.490078040450754
as you will know , the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50 % by UNK , by increasing compulsory schooling , by significantly reducing child mortality rates , and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective .    2.4836900784441793
this would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world ' s population lives , and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people . this is an extraordinary state of affairs , which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively .    3.101794715917747
the concerted actions of the united nations institutions have played an important role here , as has the bretton woods system .    2.8181494969740215
i have in mind , in particular , the important impetus given to this debate by the world bank , especially through its comprehensive framework document , and by the international monetary fund , where , for the first time , an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto UNK link , for a body of this type , between debt relief and poverty .    2.829439001117931
this new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the european union in this context .    3.478206026539422
the portuguese presidency has highlighted the need for the european union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies , and to create greater scope for coordination , in particular with the united nations system and the bretton woods system .    2.9692396487678288
if we are to strengthen the european union ' s role in international development policies , we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action .    3.006395325406668
firstly , we need to make the eu ' s development policy more effective .    3.385934776265818
as you know , an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies , and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the german presidency .    2.7610469539972273
the main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent eu policy and a more strategic overall eu approach to development issues .    2.8526736988924526
the key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies , the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the union ' s present cooperation policies , the need to make the eu ' s aid management more efficient and , in particular , to review its mechanisms for intervention , and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid .    2.9688091759637647
it is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the member states ' national policies , which are not always complementary or well coordinated . a great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the european union and its member states is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual member states and the proposals and actions of the european institutions .    2.9542257631450397
in this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost , as soon as possible , to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the member states and european union policies are coordinated and complementary .    3.128722600234529
the third aspect i would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of eu policies , the central theme of today ' s debate .    2.5936128219056562
firstly , we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other european union policies , so that development objectives can be achieved , not merely through aid and support , but also , first and foremost , through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development .    3.300688806582581
as you know , a council resolution was approved , in june 1997 , under which the commission was required to present evaluation reports .    2.6627626675098566
the first such report was presented to the council in may 1999 , and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination , notably in the fields of peace building , food safety , fisheries and migration .    2.8680698891254934
but as you will also be aware , we are waiting for a commission communication on coherence , together with the communication on development policy .    3.9749557592896596
over the coming months , that is to say during the portuguese presidency , this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the commission has undertaken to present to us .    3.161693667533248
it is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the european union . only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies .    2.577150104473234
by this i mean , of course , the internal dynamics of the european union .    2.842099308490002
we know that the european union has its own dynamics , which stem above all from the treaty of amsterdam , which has reinforced its political dimension . this inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development .    2.8223952305488624
we will also have to await the outcome of the work of the intergovernmental conference as regards enlargement , to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the european union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies , and , as regards development in particular , to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective .    3.2784931270007243
the second aspect that we need to consider , in relation to the coherence of policies , is development policy in the context of the union ' s foreign policy .    3.469580945589242
we know that the union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy , and we know that , with the creation of the high representative , of the rapid reaction force and of the military crisis management capacity , there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the european union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies . we also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue , with the adoption of common positions or joint actions , with the preparation of joint strategies , with preventive diplomacy , and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management .    3.6499703443788394
there can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the european union ' s foreign policy .    2.7678775382629635
it has to be said that , in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy , the european union is bound to go down the same road as many member states have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies .    3.4321996470266996
the success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision - making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy , so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy .    2.996957099087123
in this context , we are convinced that we need to move away from the UNK model towards to a truly european model of development aid . i say this because we know that , in europe , development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain member states , in view of the post - colonial concerns of those states .    3.4952046075905634
the third aspect that needs to be considered is european union policy and member states ' policy .    3.1199455752302954
coherence of policies at european level certainly means better coordination of member states ' policies with the european union ' s development policy .    3.4254760149814913
if we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies , it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in european union development policy .    2.4550562686807638
ladies and gentlemen , the fourth and final aspect that i would like to draw to your attention , regarding development policy , is , of course , the development council . there have been discussions , especially in recent months , about the role the development council could play in relation to eu policies .    3.125602804800329
as you know , there is a UNK difference between the status of development policies and other eu policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the edf ' s financing , or rather lack of financing .    2.777197225519655
it is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the european union ' s policies without the development council playing a more active and UNK role in relation to political decisions , which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other councils , in other decision - making forums , ranging from the agriculture and fisheries councils to the environment council . up to now , the development council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions .    2.9512428606379775
so without a more active role for the development council in the overall coordination of political decision making which , although it directly impacts on the european union ' s development policy , is largely being dealt with outside this decision - making forum , it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent european union policy on development objectives .    2.956225107241868
. let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the eu and acp countries .    2.532166209357707
i would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations .    2.7977499503646857
i saw member states working as a team , which was indeed a wonderful experience .    2.38686144712632
there was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over , not just because it was over , but because we all knew that we had achieved something together , the eu and the 71 acp countries .    2.6414009786313772
that is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation .    3.3290868095353647
i shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement .    3.6690222892578244
we explicitly address corruption ; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever .    2.963830702153302
we promote UNK approaches , we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the eu .    2.657124803329914
we UNK development policies on poverty reduction strategies .    2.493118658308202
we base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country ' s needs , but also of its policy performance .    3.023949395126731
we create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector .    3.2946355779518814
we rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming , allowing the community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme .    2.3677159027606858
we decentralise administrative and , in some cases , financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective .    2.616939847883077
we improve the policy framework for trade and investment development .    2.4111187204213995
we enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade , including new issues such as labour standards and the UNK between environment and trade .    2.6145977517895895
after seattle i am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements .    2.7117213539680733
let me turn to some of the more important points .    3.368429339107631
firstly the agreement on political issues .    2.7346577064666855
the new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership , a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active community support .    2.5306719129175357
secondly , a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law .    2.7173268882119905
in comparison with the current procedure , the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process , with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation .    2.8600821369523035
in cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements , measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be UNK .    2.902660369424859
thirdly , the eu and the acp have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption .    2.705181644512933
this is a real innovation , both in the eu / acp context and in international relations in general .    2.8049906093615764
this procedure will be applied , not only in cases of corruption involving edf money , but also more widely in any country where the ec is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development .    2.5178209990860507
it is thus not confined to ec activities .    2.488122100559803
this is a very important aspect , taking into account the UNK of public finances .    3.288658348404724
by adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement , the eu and the acp states are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by european taxpayers and hopefully also by european investors .    2.3978828724781547
another new theme in the acp - eu agreement is migration .    2.6069158448233796
we have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area .    2.655800340762685
this new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines UNK by the eu in accordance with the treaty of amsterdam and with the conclusions of the european council in tampere in finland in october 1999 .    3.2757204530135366
the european union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions .    2.7076051382980584
the agreement concluded with the acp countries paves the way for new initiatives , in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the eu , and measures facilitating their integration .    3.0628678085446173
we also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration .    2.1951298982820924
the eu and the acp states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining , within a framework to be negotiated with each and every acp country , the ways and means of UNK immigrants UNK present on the territories of each party .    2.260465182491404
this also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons .    2.4516438901004127
these very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance .    2.4699685435362606
the agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid .    2.059691920255412
we have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade - related matters .    2.2792234733331393
we have met the concerns of the acp states as far as the time - frame of the trade negotiations is concerned .    3.0675207505976214
negotiations will start no later than 2002 .    2.664761618372846
this two - year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the acp countries ' capacity to conduct trade negotiations .    2.4948793183539286
a six - year period is UNK for these negotiations .    2.874864644858377
we will take account of the economic and social constraints of the acp countries in two ways : firstly , through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and , secondly , by helping the acp states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity - building and cooperation in multilateral forums .    2.7518120823062464
this approach will lead us to a fully wto compatible regime .    2.4938460891721035
economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their acp partners .    2.578420898804626
domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know - how and technology will be transferred , all of which will boost the acp countries ' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy .    2.3022406336658476
in addition , the agreements with the eu will act as an anchor .    2.531032747157313
they will lock in the economic reforms , just as national and economic reforms will be UNK by both parties ' commitments under the agreements .    2.690188472944433
the rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction .    2.6701480465558065
another important aspect is the improvement of the eu ' s trade regime for all least - developed countries , 39 of which are actually in the acp group .    2.922876756102904
this process will take place in the coming five years so that , by 2005 , the UNK ' UNK will have free access for essentially all their products on the eu market .    3.0779636830028507
as regards the volume of the next edf , the eu has made its financial proposal .    2.9782243989909594
it is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make community aid more effective .    3.1061576439338427
today about eur 9 . 5 billion of previous edf resources are UNK .    2.36693616868026
the eu is committed to mobilising these remaining balances , plus the new edf resources , over a seven - year period , that is to say , before the entry into force of the next financial protocol .    2.484338376448825
this will enable the community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period .    2.2578070174038576
we are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity , we are moving into a period of increased activity .    2.753944976996178
such a commitment entails an in - depth reform of procedures and implementation UNK on both sides .    2.3774743054532785
there is a very real link between the reform process in the commission as such , and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the acp countries .    4.09548702053585
turning to our development policy , i would say that the global context has changed drastically .    3.3928969745218516
the marginalisation of many economies , increased poverty in the world , the need for better management of environmental UNK , the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns .    2.4554993843175636
it is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves .    2.7978971925822345
fortunately evaluations of ec aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges i have just mentioned .    2.4561199146959347
to focus on the input coming from the evaluations , i would mention the following problems : the objections of community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence .    2.601561826133098
this is due to the complexity of our own structures , but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the member states .    2.7968516375129218
the commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments , procedures and institutional mechanisms .    2.7013637670139232
often policies are more determined by the instruments available , than by policy objectives and clearly - defined priorities .    2.2852310265014024
human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage .    3.244909946174213
on average , to manage $ us 10 million of aid there are 2 . 9 staff at the commission , compared with 4 . 3 at the world bank and between 4 and 9 in major member states .    2.2468216829332435
this is a real problem : there are too many different financial instruments , each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings .    2.644672246670939
this is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system .    2.708879001703075
in order to face and solve these problems the community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with member states and parliament .    2.804296827982067
it is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way , which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework , that is , the council and parliament .    2.915803369326015
the lack of concerted action among the 15 member states themselves and between them and the community also needs to be addressed .    2.9586435131314572
by focusing the community ' s development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the member states .    2.401371238098277
this is very much the line also just presented by minister amado .    2.5011594126755186
when we talk policies nowadays , we engage in a process of convergence .    2.7990081134847267
this is part of the solution .    3.348533560250216
we are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for community action .    2.935538463478959
everything has become more and more complex .    3.0526878379218463
this is also true of development cooperation .    3.01964318325069
no single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes , ranging from macro - economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross - cutting themes such as gender , environment , good governance and institutional reforms .    2.2693107741613785
it is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country .    2.4239350037308003
this is where we want to go .    3.7603407063614456
to identify the ec ' s priority areas of support , account has to be taken of the community ' s specific features in relation to the member states and to international institutions .    3.258571879129258
i will mention just a few : our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation ; our UNK and defence of overall community interests ; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual member states can normally do .    2.3759536065882783
also , our presence on the ground : basically , i find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves , we are seen as a neutral , welcome partner for this experiment world - wide - something which nobody else can claim to be .    2.3303063018552854
it is vital to make community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework .    2.5328235790399867
it is this dual challenge that the commission has to take up , by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement .    3.026433947263663
we will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested .    3.3228782789017073
i see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate .    2.276579557083357
parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect .    2.446521349783284
this will be an ongoing process which i see as a kind of continued quality control effort and i invite parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing .    2.8589369560989444
mr president , i would firstly like to thank mr amado and mr nielson .    2.409592929341362
i am pleased that mr amado talked about the edf .    2.514266747098386
the problem , however , should not be sought within this parliament or the commission ; it is the council that needs to make a decision on the edf budget . this UNK , therefore , really belongs in the council .    3.928810205739085
mr president , i thank mr nielson .    2.6806554087516714
we want to talk about coherence .    3.185633417192169
this is the topic .    2.853582161740949
ever since the early nineties , the european parliament , the european commission and the european council of ministers have recognised that this coherence of european policy is leaves something to be desired , especially in the field of development cooperation and in other eu policies .    3.591723447779453
this problem has been highlighted on several occasions , to whit in 1992 , in 1995 and 1997 .    2.3511995827324843
the examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us .    2.400038922257842
i have raised questions regarding this issue for years now .    2.679623962497943
in fact , the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the treaty of amsterdam in 1997 .    2.7487846480265388
in 1998 , it was agreed that the european commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements .    3.3000834760179605
but what have we seen since then ?    2.412042042916179
fine words , as is the case again today , but no report . it is too crazy for words , really .    3.282760887705325
it is , therefore , with good reason that we bring this up here today .    2.6341310194021594
i would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions .    2.55006019807243
a number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production .    2.541010088027283
in the union , sugar is produced from sugar UNK .    2.802081234528251
in order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive eu sugar , a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar .    2.206318593128304
the result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the union is significantly restricted .    3.108764943152892
at the same time , we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid .    2.347319962310896
a minister from one of the caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me : if you just allowed our sugar access to the european union , we would not need your development aid at all .    2.7153817729581045
another example is cacao .    2.817668590942968
the european union intends to permit 5 % of alternative UNK in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market .    2.8438632379682702
this could just as well be 0 % - the internal market would still be harmonised .    2.839835593668248
by UNK the percentage level at 5 % , which is now likely to be the case , it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage .    3.282559721674442
it seems to be heading this way nevertheless .    2.634361114086516
what are we actually doing then ?    2.478805167992912
this is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what brussels actually does ?    2.2507124895690556
it seems that european industry is more important here than our own principles , our own UNK and the interests of the developing countries .    2.989846060324182
there are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes .    2.9017683141325716
why institute an oil boycott against UNK and not against burma , where an elected president is imprisoned , parliament has been sent home and some of the mps have been put in UNK or even murdered ?    2.5284589364138954
why not institute an oil boycott against sudan , where a great deal of the fighting is still going on , with weapons , no less , funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are ?    2.5049438793176377
the inconsistency is astonishing .    2.625401026640558
here too , mr nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new lomé convention .    2.4401073074816857
if the new lomé convention is simply put into operation , without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy , the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a UNK expression .    2.5623794534619386
the council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time : in agriculture , commerce , in conflict prevention , in the peace operations , in the fisheries sector , migration and environment .    2.7416531609154844
mr nielson , what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy .    3.255866200315821
once again , all your fine examples , your marvellous policy - and i include the secretary of state in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground .    2.4401152530659402
this is also at the request of the citizens .    3.1171594278728127
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , following the same line as mrs maij - weggen , i believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate .    2.59058091570983
the topic touches the very core of the european union .    2.63349707776865
let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating . article UNK , title UNK of the consolidated treaties of the european union reads as follows : " the community shall take account of the objectives referred to in article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries " .    2.9601100225041783
what are the objectives which each eu policy needs to take into account ?    2.9122344075281608
article 177 specifies these objectives as " sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries , and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them " , the " smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries " .    2.9857253594154707
mr president , these are no arbitrary objectives . these are articles , statutory articles , which form part of the european acquis established by law with which the european institutions and member states must comply .    3.10430021429879
every statutory article should , of course , not just be judged on its regularity , but also on the importance of its contents .    3.42202061351683
i am of the opinion - and UNK i am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens .    3.1409173565147595
the interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government .    2.990440571985046
this is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society , and also important from the point of view of effectiveness , for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently .    2.941011139680332
we should not make reality out to be more rose - UNK than it really is .    2.6696721297904276
reality is obstinate .    2.98851260836766
it is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner , without any UNK .    3.017878227502486
the government is obliged to show up any of its UNK , and to show where , when and why , problems occur with coherence of policy , rather than sweeping it all under the carpet .    2.7330299200169414
what we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be UNK with at UNK .    3.7476107693180487
poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention .    2.632592090366224
it is only natural that we in parliament guard the interests of our citizens , but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable , international environment , in which the goal of human safety is pursued .    3.46579953040312
this is a moral interest , a safety interest and is , ultimately , even in the interest of our economy .    2.534821909686282
in whose interest is it really if european taxpayers ' money is used to support economic development in namibia , and if , at the same time , the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically UNK by rigorous export subsidies , financed by the same tax payers ?    2.479392298334756
we are all acting as if this is not really happening , but we all know that it is .    4.310815744089137
it is not our task as meps to adopt an UNK policy and UNK our heads in the sand .    2.3946536990365543
the general interest of policy coherence is , therefore , a responsibility of the commission as a whole , of the council , and of the european parliament .    4.574827251627818
this responsibility cannot only be borne by the commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , however much we like to see him or hear him talk , or by the development council or the parliamentary committee on development and cooperation .    2.7638500836206052
what we need here is an integral approach .    2.542119329274049
after the UNK and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both mr amado and mr nielson , i would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals , not only by mr nielson , but by the entire commission , in order to make the policy coherent as a whole .    3.49685028821958
this is why we urge the commission , in this sharp and clear resolution , to develop specific instruments .    3.097867380608802
we need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved .    3.246334213624262
this is why i advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent .    2.1975777421990954
this is why we need to set up inter - service task groups in the commission , in the council and in parliament which can police the UNK of coherence .    4.083042440207054
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , if our neighbour ' s roof is leaking , we can lend him UNK and UNK to collect the water , but it is , of course , more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof .    2.4318096541400585
the crisis in last year ' s commission has been solved today , but the commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach , which , no doubt , the entire parliament will soon demand in the resolution .    3.0930466081757424
i would wish the commissioner all the best in his battle within the commission and wish mr amado the same within the council .    2.456018869235684
mr president , let us be clear from the outset : when it comes to cooperation , coherence is far from being the UNK .    2.7139870300702627
the treaties provide for the european union to help developing countries to develop but , as the previous speakers have explained so well , there are various distortions to these declarations .    3.536020840509408
the first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the union and the member states on individual cooperation policies .    3.323104575316982
and let us not forget that the de facto neo - colonial policy of certain member states does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop .    2.597449340432842
the second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes .    2.3914136803269703
we state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to UNK hundreds of thousands of euros into swiss bank accounts via the UNK of a number of heads of state .    2.9571168783053645
the third area of incoherence is human rights .    2.5903599687382526
we say that we want to protect human rights .    3.870715495928862
we encourage developing countries to respect human rights .    2.8537820286727897
we even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights .    2.234778927106196
we ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns .    2.2986684448800405
and yet , at the same time , we allow the arms trade to UNK and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti - personnel mines .    2.7750337597241628
nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations .    2.2840265613126225
the fourth area of incoherence in the european union ' s cooperation policy is this : how do you expect to help development by UNK the natural resources of the people you are helping .    2.995469017555597
the european union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries .    1.9582971441358759
we must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them .    2.1012067617448285
i will not even mention oil ; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as elf and total in africa .    2.7581822069997433
furthermore , and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence , we demand respect for biodiversity , for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature ; but at the same time , and this was apparent during recent negotiations , we force acp countries to sign trips agreements .    2.4355158578886336
these agreements risk being extended to living organisms , which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto UNK for small - scale farmers in the south , at the hands of the multinationals .    2.7324039083221403
and yet , and this is the sixth area of incoherence , we do not defend the application of the current treaties .    3.800039856000617
on the one hand , we vote for a budget line for the fight against aids and , on the other hand , we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same trips , despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the aids UNK .    2.7712319993997063
similarly , during the wto negotiations , at a time when , to quote the second paragraph of the UNK report , " the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries , especially the poor " , the european union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring acp countries , albeit with a transitional period of several years , instead of strengthening it , especially for the poorest countries .    3.0324578874981962
the eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature .    3.0815626186110907
we are always saying think globally , act locally .    2.1914052447813863
and yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern ngos at the expense of local programmes and southern ngos .    2.003553671035503
and what about agriculture and the environment ? still more problems , still more areas of incoherence which i might have highlighted , not to mention research , UNK or health .    2.5214625102571184
in short , we claim that we want to help developing countries and , at the same time , we encourage the liberalisation of trade , which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective .    2.902590045622324
i say it again , the european union ' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent . and on behalf of the green group i call on parliament , the institutions and the commission to make a joint effort , at long last , to put some coherence into our policy .    3.453154904580169
mr president , i feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate , not just because development is in general an important issue , but because it is also a topical one .    3.317607667860729
seattle was a failure , and north - south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons .    2.5647146125751017
the meeting held in that north american city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries .    2.0586532853367507
the UNK united nations conference on trade and development is being held right now in UNK , and is suffering the consequences of that failure .    2.9859040084942543
in the meantime , however , as has already been mentioned , the negotiations on the future of the lomé convention have been concluded .    3.549392637161746
this goes to show just how topical this subject is .    2.4492472463066677
we could also add to the list the next eu - oau summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in UNK in april .    2.5541997014004343
however , i would also like to add that any analysis , no matter how superficial , inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north - south relations , including those between the european union and the less developed countries .    2.698140532557645
you only have to realise that the category of " least developed countries " has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years , and now represents 13 % of the world ' s population , yet this category only accounts for 0 . 4 % of world exports and 0 . 6 % of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23 % since 1990 .    2.185096034490222
furthermore , the recent community budget cuts in this area , for the present financial year , are part of this trend , as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message .    2.8501840996090886
michel UNK , a fair man who is still director of the international monetary fund , said in his speech at the opening of the UNK conference , and i am now quoting , that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other . he was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries .    3.0811090094236877
it may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position , but he did indeed say this , and i heard it with my own ears .    2.502273206267968
this comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation , and i accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north - south relations and break the mould .    3.067177171742016
in particular , we need to reconsider the role of the european union in this area , as i am certain that one of the union ' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order . it is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation , bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based , and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries , particularly in this context .    3.552937126512107
a new agreement has been reached with the acp countries .    2.8887756083780127
this is a positive development in itself , especially given the pressures to UNK it and the fact that various member states did not wish it to continue .    2.8470840784519216
we will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth , but meanwhile there is no doubt that the european negotiators were more UNK and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time , even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points .    2.810885460823062
certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these .    3.1167256324477783
this was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions , and this is certainly true of the european union , especially in the field of good governance and trade .    3.1669985732130734
but it was above all the result of a stronger acp group , which obviously found new courage following the events in seattle .    2.5763941581121426
i particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging , especially as regards trade , and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area .    2.9096236528694184
lastly , we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries .    2.7459367228555545
i have in mind budgetary and financing aspects , indebtedness , assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety , humanitarian , educational and health - related issues , and also fields such as the environment , investment and access to information and new technologies . this also applies to the sphere of trade , where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other community policies , and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the member states .    2.6374081071693594
we cannot simply UNK ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong - headed .    2.783976071133444
mr president , having listened to the council and the commission today , i just had to look at my agenda .    3.246055438796051
yes , it does say : ' coherence of different union policies with development policy ' .    2.501759732703602
but we have not heard a single word on this subject , and i find that deeply embarrassing .    3.412805419416081
we have been waiting for a report on coherence for years .    2.8817806197135725
i know that the commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence , and these are what i should like to have heard expressed here today .    2.650057541317058
because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence , i shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism , namely obliging the commission to carry out an evaluation of new , relevant legislation from this aspect .    2.5095823911775077
i also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the eu ' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries : dumping of beef in UNK and south africa , UNK UNK in west africa and milk powder in jamaica .    2.721756194542104
the examples are , i hope , all well known . in any case , they are known all too well to the producers in the acp countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with eu - subsidised products .    2.665183341734726
european taxpayers contribute eur 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the eu .    2.4521364081978505
this is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries , which accounts for 69 % of the total work force there compared with 1 . 7 % in the eu .    2.6601219296846055
add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34 % of the developing countries ' gross national product , compared with 5 . 3 % in the eu .    2.892675187682796
why will neither the council nor the commission admit the fact ?    2.3247332878370774
mr president , how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental .    2.097015242005007
the prime minister of the united kingdom and his foreign secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the council .    2.846274765139626
they pointed out that the uk , france and germany far exceed the other countries of the european union at present in terms of population .    3.5737107371460195
they then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the united kingdom would not surrender its veto .    2.798314707931588
is the council discussing this issue ?    2.943352482078016
is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of council members , rather than a vote reflecting the population in europe which they democratically represent ?    2.295069253137976
have the uk representatives indicated to the council their decision and proposal and what , if any , consideration has been given to it ?    2.5973426194753784
as this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this union , surely it should receive priority consideration .    2.4940254504680794
how decisions are made is all - important .    2.695740125654001
co - president of the acp - eu joint assembly . mr president , i thank the council and the commission for their statements this morning , but i will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about .    3.397777605314246
much as i agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different union policies and development policy , i question whether today is the time to be holding it .    3.254407728002872
however , the council statement gave me hope for the future .    2.747923559967852
it is quite obvious to me , as someone who UNK in development policy , that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations .    3.0039749385445615
i will give some examples shortly .    2.580724533886567
however , i remind this house that , back in june 1997 , a council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the eu policies in relation to its development cooperation policy .    3.1771219969809157
this was followed by a request from the council to the commission to provide an annual report , the first of which was to be discussed in 1998 .    3.7988676265384806
we still await the first report , and that is why i believe this debate was premature , as the commission had little to say on coherence this morning .    3.399443611288165
the areas identified by the council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important , such as peace - building , conflict prevention and resolution , food security , fisheries and immigration .    2.8318558680271253
i personally feel that issues such as peace - building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of african heads of state , with capacity support from the european union and the oau acting as arbiter .    2.722718313364505
members of this house will have differing views , even within the same political parties , depending on ( a ) which country they come from or ( b ) which committee they sit on .    2.4759181965012114
there are areas of coherence i would like to see as a member of the committee on development that would probably UNK some of the members of the committee on agriculture or committee on fisheries .    3.2772722901824
as a lack of coherence , one can cite as mrs UNK did , the UNK of milk products to jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the UNK UNK industry .    2.5014529114093342
we have beef exported to southern africa , to namibia and south africa , which then sell their indigenous beef to swaziland , so that swaziland can fill its export quota back to the european union .    2.1512821142160035
remember too , some countries blocked an agreement with south african trade for four years .    2.3566704122439424
if we simply import raw materials from these developing countries , rather than allowing them the add - on value of producing their finished articles in their own country , we deny them the very poverty - eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations .    2.3410803560906777
i am not surprised the commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development .    2.5532649590988945
there is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment .    2.329217409119029
i wish the commission well in its task of producing that basic document .    2.1661366025100364
mr president , this morning ' s debate is very important .    2.9725585999623583
i therefore thank the commission and the council for having made a statement on the coherence of community policies in relation to development , because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective .    3.329615582657262
however , if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the UNK in our policy , we will end up totally frustrated and , furthermore , the result will be negative .    3.367083213745934
as with the systems of forces which are studied in basic UNK , it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out .    2.3004505993450683
the result of this absurd game is not zero , but rather a minus number , as a consequence of the material , financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise .    2.5115773960399808
with regard to policy , this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure UNK out the intended effect of another .    2.3335678964323483
in today ' s globalised world , this fact is all the more obvious .    2.721526368455873
there are no boundaries for community policies .    2.720580902060078
i am therefore glad that the commission and the council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of community policies , and that , together with complementarity between national and community policies and coordination between the services of the commission , they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the european union .    3.4227206012362803
both the commission and the portuguese presidency of the council state , in their respective working programmes , that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries , but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence .    3.6665307247820107
both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied .    2.873542613974336
for example , the commission , in its long term guidelines , says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity , supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account .    2.868213484707334
however , this parliament wishes to add policies to aid development , agriculture , fisheries policy , immigration , our position in international financial institutions , the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform .    2.3912250632026337
the council - and mr luis amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time , it is true , being in november 1999 , and also on other occasions , such as the development councils of may 1999 and june 1997 - but with no concrete results .    2.680473486068127
since the development council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say , as some previous speakers have pointed out .    3.2506729255136664
however , as parliament , we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter - service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different community policies , which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves .    3.193665445666984
what we really want , however , is to be UNK and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination , complementarity and , the most complex one , which we are discussing at the moment , coherence , will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the european union .    3.4950732199553562
let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the intergovernmental conference , the reform of the commission - which will also affect the development services - , this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement , to perfect a more coherent political union .    2.785602943255875
we therefore hope that the commission , in the report it is going to present to us on global policy , will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of community resources and the specific management of public interests .    3.4690957590581837
mr president , i too should like to thank the council and the commission for their reports and , in common with others , express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence .    3.0774900453819383
but we who sit here in parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is .    2.585248593567572
i should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of , in my view , useful figures .    2.6235842546931214
at the beginning of the nineteenth century , real per capita income in the world ' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries . in UNK it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher .    2.5146242010298914
on the contrary , it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further . this is shown by the following figures : the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30 : 1 in UNK , 60 : 1 in 1990 and 74 : 1 in 1997 .    2.233488073802942
these figures are from before the internet revolution took off .    2.334831538157267
in other words , there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries , including the eu countries , are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale .    3.049992268985159
in a global village , major discrepancies in the world will not , in the longer term , be tolerated by the poorest section of the village .    2.9169635747382414
at some time or another , there will be a UNK , and it will be fully justified .    4.411343243399243
i would therefore urge the council ' s presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and , above all , to conclude it in such a way that we all of us , including the people of europe , realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide .    3.227438130470106
the eu on average is far from providing the pledged 0 . 7 % .    2.314503040261339
it may well be that others are worse , but that does not place us in any better a light .    2.560807541517974
above all , however , we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us .    4.327427805553899
as far as i could hear - but i may have missed something - the president - in - office of the council did not mention the word " trade " at all .    2.254591479279932
i would just say to the commissioner that i hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the commission and the member states . i would also ask the commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up , not only in the commission but also in the member states .    3.2500195263903695
i should also like to say that , in my view , what would be most effective would be for parliament to call for proposals from , respectively , the development council and the commissioner for development . in that way , we should perhaps have a basis for discussion , instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the commission , which is scarcely likely to produce results .    3.3708289818838426
i shall conclude with a few words about the internet revolution .    2.963065002410416
as commissioner liikanen keeps saying on his UNK , we have a head start here in europe in the area of mobile telecommunications .    3.417433405498572
let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries .    3.3286083946770764
this technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which i referred and , in this connection , the eu can set the agenda , leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities .    2.7108004097278537
mr president , " the eu ' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired " .    2.9529254527875555
this is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week , commenting on the union ' s development policy .    2.425363852285592
this is not new .    2.7536790502104598
ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation , its effectiveness and quality have been called into question .    2.4594858922455756
hope of improvement threatens to be UNK in the UNK if the commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror .    3.5177052495112027
why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally ?    2.8927281260018662
one of the major conclusions of this report concerned the european policy ' s internal conflict .    3.119821219382401
in terms of trade and agriculture , in particular , the european policy is in conflict with the development policy .    3.9440799580866526
we seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries .    3.5292272976717634
this has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the union regarding development cooperation .    2.631286338926608
we should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations , but as a policy in its own right .    2.743802668297414
i advocate transparent , joint and efficient development policy .    2.2761602738012843
as long as the european approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and UNK more money , it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the member states .    2.391411086967386
finally , i would like to ask the commission to send the document i referred to to the european parliament as soon as possible , so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way .    3.1070269037043023
mr president , commissioner , i believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense .    2.842673823935735
as various members have already commented , we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies , whose objectives run counter to development in those countries .    2.553986278033294
and we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies , tourism , the environment , agriculture , fisheries and industry .    3.398325001087998
we are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies .    2.635694803055662
so there is a whole raft of contradictions .    3.494092536956763
in my opinion , these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of community policies . they are , if anything , more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some member states .    2.598953958290671
we have to be aware of this .    3.38678311673796
for me , these are the most serious contradictions in all this , more serious than the contradictions inherent in any UNK between sectoral policies .    2.8659159012086315
we obviously know that , even within any one country , there are always contradictions between various policies .    2.8405832083054974
and we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various community policies , in this case development policy .    4.180469934009326
we have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them . the underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one .    2.929532543241121
i believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between community policies and development and cooperation policy , and that this monitoring centre ' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to community policies , but should also cover member states ' actions and policies , including the actions of economic groups , which i think are also important .    2.948191475476894
this monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction .    2.4815519485003126
i have left to the end a question that i regard as fundamental and which i think needs to be noted and approved by this house .    2.9660609273517236
our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective , not merely within the european union , but also at world level , given the increasing globalisation of the economy .    3.2692612148190734
if we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next wto round of multilateral negotiations , because it would be contradictory if the european union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself , only for the united states and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint .    2.9370027753341796
that is why i consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next wto round .    2.61002353695095
mr president , the director - general of the dg for development has said that to produce a report on coherence of eu policies with development policies , before this spring ' s paper on development policy itself , is like putting the cart before the horse .    2.4033936111124956
never mind that the commission ' s requirement to produce an annual report , set out clearly in the council resolution , has produced only one " non - paper " , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is UNK UNK and the cart of other eu policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards .    2.637135895999589
time after time development policy is forgotten or is an UNK when the major policies of this european union are considered .    2.8400893899728246
take the new chocolate directive , which shows that eu countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid .    2.2082241457057177
there has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries , 90 % of which are our acp partners , estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15 % .    2.36816981242118
take the fishing agreements , where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the eu waters .    2.5370387917501405
we are , at the same time , negotiating joint UNK allowing increased access for europe ' s large - scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small - scale fish workers in those countries world - wide .    2.3822414879857443
take the trade agreements .    2.864552796804111
as mr nielson said this morning with regard to lomé , preferential access is only for " essentially all the products of the least - developed countries " .    2.481121736899091
in other words , when eu commercial interests are concerned , poverty considerations go out of the window .    2.5223870206516477
in the stance that we took at seattle , why such a silence on the eu ' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the gatt , including for the crucial UNK sector ?    2.194372734448208
on the common agricultural policy , the biggest UNK - no development impact assessment of the agenda 2000 cap reforms .    3.0886140345654365
everyone now knows of the scandal of the export UNK scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on west african markets , UNK prices for local cattle farmers by half .    1.815882782624039
today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes .    2.2897196536211863
who will be next , quite literally , for the UNK ?    3.3711549020218454
i welcome mr UNK ' statement this morning , which acknowledged the difficulties of non - UNK of the edf , which called for a more active role for the development council and which called for development priorities to be central to the eu ' s emerging common foreign and security policy .    2.9185982467185183
i welcome too the council declaration of 1992 , its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the treaty of european union .    2.7970095073350683
action simply has not been taken .    3.32587215140625
that is why we want annual reports , we want an annual inter - service group and we want a complaints procedure , to make sure action is actually taken .    2.668206759644232
i ask mr nielson , in his summing - up , to directly address those points in the resolution .    2.6118463734555935
mr president , i would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture .    2.6388806155120372
over the past couple of years , a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and , more especially , the lomé countries .    2.9667585693536873
the results are certainly not what we expected .    3.01594488326344
what could be the cause of this ?    3.232144983399401
i think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries , UNK a few exceptions .    3.140478577195677
i think that the commission could do a great deal there to help this develop .    3.001529516211239
no farmer , anywhere in the world , will produce something if prices are too low .    2.5802590752310888
the governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma : whom should they support , the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food ?    2.418852373847433
this fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the commission , and not by the commission on its own . in most countries where the commission is active , development aid is also granted by the member states themselves .    3.7845412250336747
it should not be the case that the policy of the member states contravenes that of the commission .    3.7930834882613214
it is up to the commission ' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach .    3.2476913107629453
special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production .    3.0864468301279113
far too often , artificial UNK , veterinary UNK and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge .    2.1264007285142026
once the project comes to an end after five years , the policy of free UNK also ends .    3.078482479954967
i think , therefore , that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects , and as far as i know , this is not the case by any stretch of the UNK .    3.4541993318108863
finally , i wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use .    2.9717062470421345
every year , i notice in the budget of the commission and in the european development fund , that they are far behind in spending the funds .    3.6948698770237733
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted , which is a pity .    2.816627916603692
the president - in - office of the council came up with a good suggestion , namely to budget the european development fund .    2.465107793509687
parliament would , of course , welcome this with open arms . if this were possible , it would be a huge , historic victory .    2.974354836259025
since amsterdam , three terms have taken centre stage : complementarity , coordination and cohesion .    2.1519682290687543
i believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields .    2.4895573695182556
if a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion , if a request is made at all , then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult , unless one simply UNK that there is no cohesion at all .    2.807679595144192
i would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion , and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion , for it is a long way off yet .    3.019720050108995
one thing shocked me in the speech of the president - in - office of the council .    2.1675740339519187
he stated : " contradictions in policy can lead to balance . "    2.450561285821041
it is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand , and vice versa .    2.638684835515552
but this leads to status - quo and self - UNK , and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes , indeed , but changes which have only made poverty worse .    2.6212623279806335
this is supposed to be our priority , would you believe .    2.947792449301216
i know that we do a great deal of good , but let us start with this very essential aspect .    3.0041294814970976
mr president , we have already noted that there is no report from the commission , but i intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the council presented in its 1997 opinion .    3.7046340938664657
the first is concerned with conflict resolution .    2.5104182207908092
for many years , i have tried , through the council and the commission , to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in , and working for , conflict resolution in the western UNK , which is occupied by morocco .    3.5783437378341167
the un has a peace plan .    2.7097521854076208
we ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial UNK in africa to an end .    2.385674717082154
i also want to take up the subject of migration .    3.4110193867293517
i am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the acp countries , which might make it easier to expel immigrants , asylum seekers and refugees on UNK grounds .    2.6100629443601315
i really also want to see the eu UNK patents on living organisms .    3.080854819955251
we now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds .    2.7495578121898547
three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age .    2.650032132417253
this is not because of a lack of food , but because of what we have talked a lot about today , namely increasing poverty .    3.006972537976945
food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests .    2.5692046175906627
i believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply , specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason .    1.9286965724344307
i also want to see something about women in the report i hope the commission will produce .    3.573437395169812
mr president , the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid .    2.3238900802465583
the level of aid is naturally important , and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased .    3.8990759792893965
this ought to be done with , in particular , a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity .    3.538475759920981
however , the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries .    2.7907715543204312
a number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed .    2.3810525912177973
the latter include trade , agricultural and fisheries policies .    2.3607480171890076
other important areas are , of course , the flow of private investments , cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with , and finances solutions to , a variety of global problems which affect us all .    2.495119898746023
these problems include questions of climate , health issues , biodiversity etc , and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation , that is to say the new economy which is developing .    2.663513883639993
in this economy , the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked .    2.3253580138843066
in my opinion , what we are discussing here today is partly the eu ' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance .    3.25783931273342
the report , or survey , which mrs maij - weggen has demanded , showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be , is naturally quite crucial .    2.398581561370155
i cannot help but wonder why the commission has not done more .    3.0463763270840234
the commission is new and has to be given time , but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the commission .    3.578966657176367
i can only hope that mr UNK will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the commission .    2.949209712375351
an analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries . these include technology , trade , cooperation in the field of research etc .    2.695355997542739
it should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting .    3.582814974427963
finally , parliament recommends , in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution , that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence .    3.223215902753064
i believe it is only a coincidence , but the commissioner for the environment is also , of course , to participate in this group .    3.7481306401567833
let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed .    4.361229770844653
policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other .    2.719175238046904
there are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest .    2.762789280018266
mr president , the seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less - and least - developed countries , it is purely a rich country UNK interest .    2.299851948676292
yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as india and tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent .    2.162595173555214
there the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs , allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain .    1.9721116758744166
it did not work ; poverty became worse than ever .    2.5234010772455178
the medicine may not taste too good in the short term , but opening one ' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term .    2.3139084029349397
is that not the lesson of the european union itself and of the single market in particular ?    3.7937848506305647
as mr nielson said , this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity .    3.0810285420239922
we also have to practise what we preach in our own UNK for imports from these countries . parliament ' s resolution on the wto negotiations advocated a free import policy by the eu .    2.649583043454963
eliminating all remaining barriers to imports , tariff barriers and quotas and , just as important , non - tariff barriers , such as mrs maij - weggen mentioned in her speech - eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire .    2.215301138475888
it is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy UNK our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for europe and our fine words .    2.406503460177691
mr president , in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence , coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the community and of the member states .    3.2769969825966982
there is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public UNK which would be a litmus test of the union ' s ability to match words with action .    2.638034629769571
i am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti - personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes , to post - conflict reconstruction , and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world , particularly in developing countries .    3.000581285904905
over recent years the community has spent some eur 200 million in mine UNK , assistance to victims and related activities .    2.0886501665642165
the member states have spent similar amounts .    3.123867789257425
but there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti - personnel landmine problem within a UNK time span .    2.842992707866998
mr nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with member states .    2.943648056879254
this has been talked about for years .    2.556519404554537
the commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes , strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions , ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell .    2.2118998246990946
it would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes .    2.0389641284179207
a proper stock - taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines .    2.608887716649791
it seems to me that the landmine issue UNK so many of the organisational , procedural , financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the commission and the union .    2.59522419142782
are these UNK of the past , or will we find that in this relatively UNK and limited area the european union is still unable to meet its aspirations ?    3.4939906116303017
mr president , commissioner nielson , the conclusion of the new acp - eu convention is an important step towards greater coherence .    2.955762821241523
and it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights , democracy , rule of law , and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously , and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent , rather , we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect .    2.5231544875715173
for these are prerequisite to any development .    2.5985473039085383
if these criteria are not adhered to , then development does not stand a chance    2.397447865189154
the same goes for cuba , mr UNK .    2.6953100416996025
after all , we are all familiar with the reports from amnesty international .    3.040886839914611
it may well be that you , having belonged to one of the last communist dictatorships , view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this chamber , and that you have problems where good governance is concerned .    3.084685512742606
nonetheless , these are important criteria for the european union .    3.223988604127539
there is a second issue i would like to raise .    3.231424682522078
we are discussing coherence here .    2.8949922640891397
many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent .    2.864545239573092
in my view , however , the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too .    3.9918761584364635
there is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the member states and there are some projects being carried out by the member states and the european union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another .    3.8743715071519103
nor is there coherence vis - à - vis the european taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the union ' s budget but the edf remains outside it .    2.3027910007892767
mr president - in - office of the council , if in future you succeed in making this eur 13 . 5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary committee on budgetary control , and to bodies such as olaf , then i believe you will raise the level of acceptability .    2.509404941187867
this , to my mind , is also something that we should call upon the intergovernmental conference to do , i . e . establish the edf firmly in the budget of the european union .    3.1564196060549228
first , the committee on development and cooperation advocates the communitisation of the edf ; clearly that is misguided .    2.6611437393040562
in our view , cooperation is , and should remain , an intergovernmental exercise .    2.649792484144268
with europe preparing to enlarge , UNK the edf would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the community budget , quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy .    2.516566929977302
lastly , the commission has , in the recent past , had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid UNK , as mrs maes has just reminded us so opportunely .    3.0845241451084053
why should we add to them ?    2.812525867529451
secondly , we find it most regrettable that mr corrie ' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with south africa because , in the final analysis , this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the european commission is taking ever more frequent recourse .    2.730030599701894
it is perfectly UNK that the union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the member states in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank .    3.1923090657762856
and let me say in passing , it is even more astonishing that the council allowed it to .    3.3376658927867755
as a result , we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed .    2.8429204914608697
the part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the union ends up paying producers to stop producing UNK , port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law . imagine the potential cost of such a precedent .    2.3398629655719976
it is proof , as if we still needed it , of the fact that UNK diplomacy , which defends no interests , unless of course they are individual interests , and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly ngos , is not just inefficient , it is positively dangerous .    2.6830090409072134
finally , a word on the general thinking behind the corrie report .    2.364576503003759
nowadays , let us face it , the joint assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the UNK in geneva and washington .    2.94182954989885
it was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened .    2.7114726850107176
. ( pt ) mr president , by way of both a conclusion and a summary , i would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate .    2.9042795274446664
first of all , many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality , and increases poverty .    2.1112902836363547
this suggests that something must be done , failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or UNK .    2.2436030406470735
secondly , it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context , taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality .    2.51978985078431
i believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the european union ' s role in international development policies is significant .    2.9138179904467427
everyone recognises , indeed this was the theme of today ' s debate , that , if the european union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level , it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development - related policies . i note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in eu policies is not a matter for the council , for the commission or for parliament alone .    3.364614730885273
quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation , be it on the part of the commission or of the council , or even on the part of the european parliament itself , and some members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development .    3.343850126193265
finally , i would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the portuguese presidency ' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the european union ' s policies , and in particular in the context of its foreign policy .    3.953352049353508
we believe that this is absolutely vital , failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies , and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning europe ' s status in the international system .    3.092071608849939
for this reason it may be necessary , as i have stressed , to change the model and move away from the post - colonial model towards a more european approach to development policies .    2.938515051086559
in this respect i believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention , which succeeds the lomé convention , is an important instrument of renewal , and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process , as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in seattle .    2.7126961145313784
. i sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate .    2.883595624473915
i have given you a statement on behalf of the commission which i think provides a useful background to this discussion .    3.0258988129557363
we will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence .    2.449796807511746
this discussion is not new .    2.6924425230904907
i have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the commission and the dg on development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda .    3.007311511571788
this also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the commission system which may very well include , as suggested by some of the political groups in parliament , the setting up of a special intra - service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the commission .    2.9998051907828738
i have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything .    2.425095873057771
much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every member state , as has been very honestly said here in this house : people more or less identify with their spheres of interest , and all this is legitimate .    3.030673720428964
i would , however , warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical UNK in the system .    2.7610135230039923
this exists , but it is only a small part of what we are discussing .    3.549399859215608
the major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on , and this is the problem .    3.1721579053203484
mr mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low .    2.2366225923154412
this is true in our part of the world , but our partners and beneficiaries in africa have a slightly different perspective .    2.7054874911349116
they farm , not just for a living , but in order to live , and this makes a difference .    3.7531132545115797
subsistence farming is not based on price calculations , it is based on the hope of rain in the next season .    3.0497723736061957
this does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty - focusing which we need to deliver better than so far .    2.738451431136179
from that perspective , what i am saying here is of deep relevance .    2.619592561926228
other issues have been mentioned : cattle - farming in namibia , UNK and milk powder in the caribbean .    2.711107202434883
we should not be too masochistic .    3.0506889253705047
there is a limit to how useful that is .    2.5357781475298435
all these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of .    3.4288057251643527
the intervention prices have been regulated , and the problems we had with beef in western africa and in namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support .    2.397205020922146
these are real problems , but they have all been dealt with .    2.9510155922182877
as regards the issue of cacao , chocolate : i repeat that the 5 % has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries .    2.9040789871719808
what we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in UNK UNK as UNK for farmers in UNK .    2.635163452210733
this is not a clear case of incoherence , it is more a case of a competition between suppliers .    3.3484789185000574
what was mentioned concerning sugar in the caribbean is more complicated .    2.4765517829284094
in the overseas countries and territories framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem , but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some european companies than with generating income in the caribbean . in any case , this is a matter which we are currently dealing with .    3.080667109065725
i am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and i would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with south africa .    3.3938042331055494
in all modesty , i would claim that this is something that documents that the commission is willing to walk or fly the extra UNK in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests .    3.3124684078579607
we certainly have done our share to solve that problem , and i sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement .    2.7184873470741215
finally , i thank you again for this debate .    2.788764427880702
we will come back again with material on these issues , because these problems , in one way or another , are here to stay , simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally - defined trade interests , etc . we have to reconcile those different approaches .    2.5713159297416324
thank you very much , commissioner nielson .    2.3081696961359657
i have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .    2.315826152379551
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.716053081557172
next session of un human rights commission    3.4854910824406957
the next item is the statement by the council on eu priorities for the next session of the un human rights commission on 20 march 2000 .    2.7066880381615803
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the european union played an active role in the 55th session of the human rights commission held in geneva in march and april 1999 .    2.5390715238518475
it tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in iran , iraq , in the israeli settlements , in burma / myanmar , in the democratic republic of the congo and in sudan , and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on colombia and on east timor .    2.506396505328771
for the first time , the european union tabled a resolution on the death penalty , which was enormously successful , and led work on a resolution concerning children ' s rights , which was a joint initiative with the latin american group of countries .    3.0663732098707457
the union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the human rights commission to be held in geneva in march and april .    2.7666845871347747
in particular , as agreed at the human rights council group on 9 february 2000 , the european union intends to table draft resolutions on the israeli settlements , iran , iraq , sudan , the democratic republic of the congo , burma / myanmar , a draft chairman ' s statement on colombia , and , possibly , on east timor , together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries .    2.581679519316894
the european union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the human rights commission at the next meeting of the human rights group in march .    2.892836509938176
in particular , there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty .    3.1741784531896715
to date , the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect , and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary , including article 2 ( 7 ) of the charter of the united nations , which refers to sovereignty .    3.360283092061715
we have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text , in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the third committee of the united nations general assembly , at which the member states failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to article 2 ( 7 ) into the draft resolution sponsored by the european union on the death penalty .    2.8948726460506258
as you know , at the 55th session of the human rights commission held last year , the united states decided , at a very late stage , to table a draft resolution on china .    3.118333244036982
this draft resolution was defeated by a chinese no - action motion .    2.2296239026208617
the european union voted against that motion .    2.7903029608676957
the european union ' s position on the approach to be adopted towards china in the human rights commission was confirmed at the general affairs council on 21 march 1999 : there was no european union initiative on china nor was agreement reached to co - sponsor a resolution on china , but an eu vote against the no - action motion .    2.3323178125547597
it is by no means certain that the european union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote .    2.763956678806314
the united states of america will be tabling a draft resolution on china at the 56th session of the human rights commission and are putting pressure on the european union to support this draft resolution .    2.8603883779116357
this initiative has provoked a strong reaction on china ' s part : the chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the european union , in an attempt to persuade them not to support the united states ' initiative .    2.858949949043279
this initiative is being discussed within the union , but with no hope of a decision in the near future .    3.2616098711481865
it is in the interests of the european union to keep all its options open for as long as possible , and in any case at least until after the eu - china human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 february 2000 .    3.031726232316046
in view of changes made to the membership of the human rights commission , we estimate the vote on the no - action motion will be close .    2.6027542125567718
it is therefore important this year , too , that the countries of the european union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution .    3.550414059691405
in this context it is important to note that the european union regularly opposes requests by china that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the human rights commission in geneva .    2.9100237317564552
the european union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party , the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground , and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the human rights commission , potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing .    3.070301719145067
the european union also regularly informs china that the human rights commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues , and whether or not it agrees with this initiative , this is in any case legitimate from this point of view .    2.9327734384646393
the next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 february in lisbon , and will include seminars on legal issues and on women ' s rights , and it is expected that representatives from the UNK world and from civil society will take part .    2.802630707968721
the next human rights seminar will be organised by the portuguese presidency in may 2000 , and , during the last round of the dialogue in october 1999 , the chinese side accepted the european union ' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the united nations international pact on economic , social and cultural rights and the united nations ' international pact on civil and political rights , both of which have been signed by the chinese government .    3.177800747370847
the european union is discussing issues on which it hopes that china will take concrete measures , and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the chinese authorities the message that the european union hopes china will announce positive measures at the session on 25 february .    2.6838428054888883
the presidency will also present to the chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern .    2.816432750268723
the meeting held in beijing in october 1999 confirmed that , on the one hand , the chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself , with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention . on the other hand , they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity .    2.7170727995419677
discussions within the european union about the situation in china following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the european union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in china more firmly ; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue , while recognising the positive steps that china has made on the international stage .    2.880203886405021
on various occasions the european union has reiterated to the chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue , and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas .    2.650741997242693
it was decided that the dialogue should continue , but in a more targeted and effective way , given that china has agreed with the european union ' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars .    3.0966949414024585
lastly , during the next human rights commission there will also be a debate on UNK the work of the commission itself .    4.236016608321471
a working party has been set up with the express task of UNK the commission ' s mechanisms . this working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous , especially in the financial field .    3.5526010088612696
the european union will oppose any UNK attempt to use this reform of the human rights commission ' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level .    2.575616632197468
. mr president , i would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for geneva on subjects like racism , civil and political rights and the right to development .    2.849858339318965
as the presidency said , much remains to be done , despite the understandable request by parliament and many ngos that the european union should set out its position well in advance of the geneva session .    2.852490966858159
that is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the UNK issues .    3.2726860918316762
for example , discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in parliament ' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases .    3.158511442523473
it is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult .    3.1178401587485616
that does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference .    2.6607408202002456
however , let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues : the death penalty , cuba and china .    2.379341515766554
i am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal UNK to UNK into my remarks .    2.8537613212253627
we are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the human rights commission .    2.440823439900633
this has always been a subject about which i personally have felt extremely strongly , i have always voted against the death penalty .    2.7559820507236306
UNK on by amnesty international and others , one of the first decisions i took as governor of hong kong was to abolish the death penalty .    2.4177811732049035
we had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid .    2.237893861947836
the new york stage is different from geneva .    2.558428642746555
last year ' s debate in new york on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues .    2.3487184097487206
it certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty .    2.6938489747657077
the debate in geneva , however , is more focused on human rights issues .    3.5579085190442226
we may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there .    2.3799915486417857
secondly , cuba .    2.8575021772877545
i want to address this issue directly because we in europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously .    2.3149752007620488
we are extremely concerned about moves by the cuban government over the last year that have further UNK public freedom , moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty .    2.273767034265738
we are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions .    2.7196808739516567
we are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of ngos and the work of our human rights working group based in the eu UNK in havana .    2.748046017882517
we have regularly put our criticisms to the cuban authorities , and this parliament has done the same .    2.875610020701461
but i do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate cuba .    3.334208563556358
we want a fair and open society in cuba , a cuba which respects the principles of the market , the UNK of contract and the rule of law .    2.97296334703071
we want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .    2.656959763853283
my views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which i wish to deal , namely china .    2.7908107639354607
quite simply , i want us to be engaged with china .    3.2623454067256934
it would be self - UNK and self - UNK , as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity , to want anything else .    2.760820998769744
i also want to see a china transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy UNK or religious UNK .    2.1981700667397517
so what should we do ?    2.8499934563960045
naturally we should trade enthusiastically with china and hope that we can welcome china into the world trade organisation on sensible terms .    2.5546365001111533
it is a UNK to talk about a world trade organisation which does not include china - or russia , for that matter .    3.0722913647941694
but i do not believe today , nor have i ever believed , that our burgeoning economic relationship with china - manifested , for example , by china ' s eur 25 billion surplus with the european union - should silence us when it comes to china ' s human rights record .    2.466178445386891
for me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in china - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this ?    3.462923309607805
so what should be our attitude towards a geneva resolution this year ?    2.395901150026344
as the presidency has noted , the union as a whole is considering its position .    3.1003336597361164
but i strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the member states ought to take proper account .    3.17544303253576
first , while some people question whether tabling a geneva resolution makes any difference , several of the most distinguished chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move , not least because of the message it sends to people in china itself .    2.499343528538763
that is a point that deserves serious consideration .    2.6202084115726074
secondly , we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in china in recent months , for instance , the heavy sentences imposed on democracy UNK , the detention and recent UNK meted out to members of christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of falun gong .    2.5035431771800143
chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in tibet .    2.9202966967532
we have made our views very clear to them .    2.4824735398451847
while we all know that for many people in china there has been a real long - term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties , there is a dark side to the picture as well .    2.9379261325523327
critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with china .    2.8633207998033923
that is true and potentially valuable , although i have to say - and i have said to chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked .    3.031169505698542
of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement eu cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres .    2.7700162024588857
that is very welcome and i also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level .    2.4147081915693533
naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long - term process , but i wish i could point to more real gains .    3.3563070970808795
the next dialogue in lisbon on 25 february will be an important test .    2.6709478800495936
it will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not .    2.3931361997262064
what , finally , do we want to see as the first steps ?    3.8436921902819625
well , for example , we would like to see china move from signing the un conventions on civil and political rights and on social and cultural rights UNK actually ratifying them .    2.5858720097366263
i wish we were closer to that .    2.4538239368664194
where does all that leave us this year ?    2.430371906292922
i repeat that member states will have to make up their minds .    3.405443460286975
what i hope is , first , that we in europe will adopt a common position and stick to it , that we will not allow some to be UNK off , that our position will not be based on self - UNK or UNK , that it will be a common position and a sensible position .    4.03672568222744
i know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions .    2.612742501181115
but if that is true , then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward .    2.9799963989183893
if we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue , then we need to be able to convince you , the ngo community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere .    3.5211391941619663
that , in my judgement , is the challenge for the next few weeks .    4.414408459684082
i am grateful to the house for its concern about human rights around the world , and particularly in china .    2.9170462613148525
thank you very much , commissioner patten .    2.1334526225371873
we will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the un human rights commission and proceed to the vote .    2.6812843435129134
welcome    3.614357701079869
i am delighted to welcome a delegation of the hong kong legislative council to parliament .    2.2214038541470864
( loud applause )    2.301445795846968
vote    3.1522193301854244
. as mrs wallström explained during yesterday ' s debate , the commission is able to accept the following amendments : amendments nos 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 13 .    2.5972636674193765
the commission can also accept amendment no 4 in principle .    2.7471998679261884
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 3 , 5 , 6 , 12 , 14 , 18 and 16 .    2.310922583160955
( the president declared the common position approved as amended )    2.085256452806236
report ( a5 - 0023 / 2000 ) by mr böge , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending council directive 91 / 68 / eec as regards scrapie ( com ( 1998 ) 623 - c4 - 0026 / 1999 - 1998 / 0324 ( cod )    2.2378052350976896
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )    1.859109816008224
recommendation ( a5 - 0008 / 2000 ) by ms cederschiöld , on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market on the proposal for a council decision on the approval , on behalf of the european community , of the wipo copyright treaty and the wipo performances and phonograms treaty ( UNK / 1999 - com ( 1998 ) 249 - c5 - 0222 / 1999 - 1998 / 0141 ( avc )    2.4292513112043066
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )    1.859109816008224
report ( a5 - 0015 / 2000 ) by mr graefe zu baringdorf , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a council directive amending directive 70 / 524 / eec concerning additives in feedingstuffs ( com ( 1999 ) 388 - c5 - 0134 / 1999 - 1999 / 0168 ( cns )    2.0641654845593327
before the final vote :    3.3556166938675767
. ( de ) mr president , following this vote , i would like to ask the competent commissioner , mr byrne , if , now that he has seen how much support there is in this chamber , he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments ?    3.6084636554172334
. i regret to say that i believe that the thought - out position i advanced yesterday is the correct position .    3.0250224608664107
the comprehensive approach that the commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under article 152 where parliament will have a codecision function .    3.127340523281695
that is the appropriate way of dealing with this .    3.0457024551463787
mr president , in accordance with article 69 ( 2 ) , i call for referral back to committee .    2.4887878315807592
the reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure , as proposed by the commission .    2.6557755493403183
we have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive , in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms .    3.0244987760805038
we take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time , but the commission will not adopt this .    3.939126882292236
i believe that , in accordance with article 69 ( 2 ) , we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the commission , and i would therefore urge my fellow meps to decide in favour of referral back to committee .    3.400743377974186
( parliament decided to refer the report back to committee )    2.765750627762509
mr president , permit me to say quite publicly to mrs stenzel , who is a member of the övp executive , that many meps are horrified that you have entered into a coalition with haider , and that we wish to denounce you for doing so !    2.78481895520869
( applause from the left . heckling from the right )    2.5390676466315636
. ( de ) mr cohn - bendit , i do not think that the european parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country ' s domestic politics , in the way that you are doing .    3.0860933858116435
i can speak for my party , which championed austria ' s membership of the european union in the early days .    3.069125644992732

welcome    3.614357701079869
this is perhaps an appropriate moment to welcome to the official gallery , a delegation of four members of the moroccan parliament , led by mr UNK UNK , deputy speaker of the chamber of representatives .    2.581715572670601
we are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 march 2000 of the association agreement between morocco and the european union .    2.3746653872699506
on this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments .    2.1929633669363993
it is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the UNK countries will be visiting morocco on 20 to 22 march .    2.439906699548725
i hope the delegation has an excellent visit to strasbourg .    2.4134823331534823

report ( a5 - 0033 / 2000 ) by mr andersson , on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs , on the communication from the commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection ( com ( 1999 ) 347 - c5 - 0253 / 1999 - 1999 / 2182 ( cos )    2.2921470730278246

explanations of vote - lienemann report ( a5 - 0014 / 2000 )    2.6213602716587276
. ( fr ) i welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on life .    3.2413674301931032
i shall briefly remind you that life is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the european union and also in third countries , whether they be neighbouring countries around the mediterranean , countries around the baltic sea or applicant countries .    2.6457050882094575
the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection has proposed many amendments which have , for the most part , been retained in the common position adopted by the council .    2.5992144878654475
as far as the third phase of life ( 2000 - 2004 ) is concerned , the instrument is to be divided into three sections , life - nature ( 47 % of the resources ) , life - environment ( 47 % ) and life - third countries ( 6 % ) .    2.54214465133828
in my opinion , the most important amendments concern the following :    3.23405282439115
life ' s contribution to sustainable development within the community and also to the development of community policy in the field of the environment , particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies , as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment ;    3.989378086257938
improving the efficiency , transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of life , procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public , and procedures for cooperation between recipients ;    2.9584087184779717
the objectives of life : this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development , in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the urban initiative , on which i have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere ;    2.9204801842419412
the contribution that the projects supported by life make to the sustainability of social and economic activities , and thus job creation .    2.754767889879396
the other candidate countries ( e . g . cyprus , turkey , malta ) my also take part in life when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries .    2.0408171916950533
the stumbling block in the negotiations with the council lies , of course , in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the life programme ( 2000 - 2004 ) .    3.094333663539501
the commission proposal , ratified by the council , is for eur 613 million , whilst the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection considers that the budget should be eur 850 million .    2.8671193404813486
i support mrs lienemann ' s firm stance .    2.711548945472872
the financial allocation has not in fact been UNK since the programme was created , even when the membership of the ec was increased to fifteen member states following enlargement .    2.6109090104929944
if the report is adopted in plenary session , then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened , in accordance with the codecision procedure , in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme .    3.2304743353770147
this type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions !    2.38009825846168
böge report ( a5 - 0023 / 2000 )    2.88361835313857
. ( fr ) as an mep and , more importantly , as a consumer , i welcome the european commission ' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the european union .    3.0376395770726035
this proposal has two objectives : first , to amend the 1991 council directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and , secondly , to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating UNK UNK UNK ( tse ) or bse - type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species .    2.2157495096215767
what is interesting UNK this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie .    2.9829928321478527
what is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow - up report on the mad cow crisis .    3.233337361164123
i also consider it essential , for the sake of coherence , that existing legislation on scrapie , which is limited to the trade in UNK and UNK animals , should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on tse affecting all animals throughout the european union , rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs .    3.0871065393184773
these rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie .    2.4941555343573842
a number of scientific UNK maintain that scrapie developed into bse in cows and therefore caused the bse epidemic .    2.1159804301702057
even if this proposal for a european parliament and council regulation to prevent and combat certain tse needs to be made more accurate and more effective , especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie , it is still a UNK improvement .    3.0499760616880702
it is a pledge to european citizens , who have voiced their concern , as regards european food policy , on many occasions .    2.8615833562501627
the european parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard .    3.106546950227123
as a result of the debates on the principle of precaution , traceability , responsibility and transparency , the european commission has presented a white paper on food safety .    3.108405535774894
this white paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent european food authority as part of a european strategy to restore consumer confidence .    2.985832661480668
it is up to us , as responsible europeans , to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive .    2.5675606015983665
cederschiöld report ( a5 - 0008 / 2000 )    2.623812487601911
mr president , i voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because i believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the european parliament .    3.007095076461893
in my view , products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products , namely , those that can be seen and touched .    2.3533292579435177
the fruits of the UNK and science , which are UNK , are of inestimable importance . therefore , the european community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement , not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving , through the knowledge and experience they have acquired , to give future generations something better than that which they have today .    2.912545108003875
. ( da ) we oppose , on principle , the european community ' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the member states .    2.741393199821602
we are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the member states and the community . at the same time , we appreciate the fact that the wipo treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of UNK and UNK artists .    3.3667287812001954
we are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation .    2.983933531973854
- ( de ) the group of the greens / european free alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because , in the plenary debate of the previous day , commissioner bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding eu accession to the wipo treaties .    2.579853812630263
in institutional terms , there has been no clarification of what role the ep is to play in the further development of the wipo treaties .    2.7840539863636242
in addition , there is a clear tendency , in matters of international jurisdiction , more and more often to obtain a pure eu jurisdiction .    2.7175338571239593
when it is , then , still not clear to what extent the ep can participate in the decision - making processes , the question of legitimacy arises .    3.2832702203953903
moreover , the concept of ' author ' is not defined in the treaties .    2.6739786271176302
in this regard , too , the commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on , and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others .    2.6007409712549743
one of the UNK aspects is the public interest : will ratifying and applying wipo lead to the privatisation of culture ?    2.606868017790285
and , finally , the matter of the relationship between trips and wipo must be clarified . regarding this , too , there has been only silence by way of a response from the commission .    3.148781673807717
if nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation , then we must at least abstain from voting .    2.3794941868728
graefe zu baringdorf ( a5 - 0015 / 2000 )    3.0054556114527284
. ( pt ) food safety issues are in the spotlight following the bse and dioxin scandals .    2.433070966052634
gmos are still the subject of great uncertainty , both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health .    2.801241214844397
the precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty .    2.969679626890991
the profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises .    2.4999459112591693
this is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in , making a legal link between the issue of gmos and feedingstuffs , and noting that the latter " shall be authorised only if . safe for human health and the environment " .    2.4132592974953195
furthermore , he considers that " genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document , official or otherwise , which is UNK to or UNK the additive " .    2.4289612438159027
this will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer ' s freedom of choice .    2.288637450240828
in view of the montreal protocol on genetically modified organisms ( gmos ) , i welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report , and i have therefore voted in favour of it .    3.1999335812069334
stenzel report ( a5 - 0034 / 2000 )    3.0749739299077645
mr president , i would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote , on behalf of the ppe group on the equal report .    2.8067709996053596
we have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the socialist group .    2.2334108104934605
the socialist group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been .    3.255751925539789
this is why we are abstaining .    2.597884053644967
we want to ensure that the equal report , which is very important for refugees , the elderly , the handicapped and women , simply goes ahead .    3.669803249764157
it is regrettable that , due to the procedure , the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session .    2.9129550269644477
i am convinced that the rapporteur ' s nationality has played a certain role , which should not be of relevance in this parliament .    3.0379613361021187
this is actually in conflict with european values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this parliament .    2.373390408247331
these were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report .    2.53835702950244
we want equal to go ahead .    2.6546477065334484
we assent to the main thrust of it , but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage .    3.046472967569075
mr president , as the representative of the pensioners ' party in the european parliament , i abstained in the vote on the equal initiative because , although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination , its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific .    2.77208558360149
i also abstained for another reason . i think the time has come for the european institutions to stop UNK and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give european citizens some firm indication regarding what europe wants europe to be .    2.475179252955936
the time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice .    2.1032168432300886
. ( da ) we have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the commission concerning the guidelines for eu initiative programmes ( cip ) .    2.444475796367452
basically , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have simply adopted a position on the issue .    2.8800261092955304
we think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report .    3.336843828983013
. ( fr ) we did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market .    2.8122017967424853
nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague , all too pie in the sky .    2.808876159318184
and yet , in the chapter on aid and training for refugees , the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to " refugees within the meaning of the geneva convention " .    2.4115906955512614
this restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout europe are in a drastic situation , with no protection , forced to work on the black market , and to hide , while so - called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down .    2.534080166612112
the first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of UNK , the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment , the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion .    2.836531584428227
.    2.489189446364389
i voted in favour of mrs stenzel ' s report on the equal initiative as i believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous now , horizon , youthstart and integra strands of the adapt and employment initiatives .    3.0298346705832144
the lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on .    2.6494883952357906
equal stands for " equality " .    2.5096735491018887
it must be seen to deliver .    3.0899104970243103
i welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market .    2.3251404416068064
i also favour the desire to move away from an out - dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment .    2.0691821776239934
there must be flexibility .    2.8254870958574028
i deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative .    2.459099239529449
in the last programming period 9 % of structural funds were available for community initiatives .    2.627057808865064
the figure is now 5 . 35 % .    2.3733716571711803
this means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated .    2.2000445417517134
the employment and social affairs committee adopted several of the amendments i put forward , concerning for example , the emphasis on access to start - up capital , how to exploit new business opportunities in cities , towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business .    2.5615521748795844
this often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities .    2.3346107824823736
the positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process .    2.1516932269148885
i also stressed the need for prevention .    3.187819653913832
there must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority .    2.4548366459861635
there must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets .    2.294203037961519
while there are some aspects of the report which i believe would be better dealt with in a different way , overall i believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported .    3.0994245581815987
.    2.489189446364389
( pt ) the commission intends to use the community initiative equal to replace the community employment and adapt initiatives and various UNK in these areas , such as now , on new opportunities for women , horizon , for disabled persons , youthstart , for promoting the labour market integration of young people , and integra , for groups threatened with exclusion . unfortunately , this involves a significant reduction in appropriations .    2.430396901625811
accordingly , the commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market , based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines .    2.7188196801642013
this is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations .    2.7303172706492482
however , in order to give this new approach some chance of success , the commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal , a more simple and direct one , involving the ngos from the outset , so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way .    2.7526335348808786
the commission did not do that .    2.6518497085511936
we hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned .    3.1194184606958357
mr president , some of us in parliament will remember the successful film , " UNK " , in which some elderly people UNK a special kind of water that made them young again .    2.4840113463726268
in my view , it is , therefore , immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and , consequently , to study and approve the provisions referred to here .    2.3422364485687805
for that reason , i approved these measures , but i should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water UNK at the point where it enters our houses , to ensure that it is of the highest level .    3.3905428060344476
in the measures that have been adopted , i note that support for people who UNK their water in their own homes has been omitted . i trust that this will be remedied in the future .    3.00072076370532
apart from amendment no 76 , which was an error , since i intended to vote in favour , the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following UNK situation :    2.851784962261253
supposed draft environmental directive : " european parliament and council directive establishing the obligation to maintain , during winter , a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets , UNK and parks of the cities of europe " .    2.282932367005112
guidelines of the directive : a ) each city shall provide the means , in terms of energy and technology , sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012 ; b ) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices .    2.570283980689776
opinion of an mep from the south of europe : " nevertheless , this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions " .    2.8445906886195935
( end of fiction ) .    2.554016996730115
in explaining my vote , i must say that it is positive that there is a community directive on water , but i believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of europe , but will lead to legislative UNK .    4.0832935959077385
we cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts , such as the mediterranean countries , and countries with northern levels of rainfall .    2.443784465406157
furthermore , it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water , between different river basins , practically impossible in the future .    2.583003889217417
once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union .    2.8925002151211965
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) drinking , eating , washing , farming - water UNK each act of our daily life and we treat it , wrongly , as an UNK and UNK resource .    2.257887248073456
a simple gesture such as turning on a UNK seems to bring water straight from the source .    2.206433730041676
but the source is threatening to run dry .    2.471598315188422
scientific studies are now no more than a UNK : water will be the main resource at stake in years to come , starting tomorrow .    2.7483694697804766
but tomorrow will be too late .    2.717500076964414
we have to lay down the rules of play today , before we all lose .    2.8461357534667378
in adopting the water directive on wednesday 15 february , the european parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water , coastal UNK , inland waters and groundwater .    2.462091009421061
europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water , promote its sustainable use , protect eco - systems , help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances .    2.433092582644939
we have thrown water a life - belt .    2.4272122553504687
. ( fr ) it is with the greatest satisfaction that i welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy .    2.587738052245391
the ecological disaster on the banks of the danube is a reminder , as if we needed one , that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water .    2.3927039366133442
the objective of this proposal for a directive , which dates back to 1997 , is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water , coastal waters , inland waters and groundwater .    2.6078004655881175
it provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration , protect ecosystems , promote sustainable water use , help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances .    2.1596393860135916
specific directives will then be adopted within this framework .    2.8747770047365484
the procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy .    2.428968954846741
the proposal for a directive was amended twice , first in 1997 and then in 1998 .    2.409082854492416
a technical working party made up of council and parliament representatives met in january 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions .    2.6022294651646893
however , the committee on the environment has tabled numerous amendments , most of which i support .    2.861012760920253
as far as the timetable and objectives are concerned , the council ' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive , while the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy wants this reduced to 10 years .    2.8336869952126733
the committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020 , the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020 .    2.391599195998919
the council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years , but the commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years .    2.4152607270900837
all the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years , not 16 .    2.5183553367922054
i must say that i support these reduced deadlines , especially as provision is made for derogations .    2.533728902790041
as far as costs are concerned , i approve the proposal whereby member states will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources .    2.6532366861683956
i likewise expect the european commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012 .    3.120096437648201
i will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the committee on the environment , which needs no further comment : " water is not a commercial product like any other but , rather , a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the european union and which must be protected , defended and treated as such " .    2.7726999426833236
. i wish to put on the official record my concerns with the lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote .    2.8162421909343776
we have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water .    3.055955082533757
there is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur .    3.0863107293583125
however , the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which , under the rules of subsidiarity , should be left to the member states for decision .    4.2218699015622425
in my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common european charge for this issue .    2.1391245877819016
in ireland all the major users of water , commercial , industrial and agricultural , already pay for their use of water .    2.5130464200843616
this is a decision of national and local government , and this is where all future decisions should be retained .    3.0745006097341276
these are the main reasons for my vote .    2.669045930884272
. the european union is currently in the process of adopting new eu water legislation to update and to establish a long - term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters .    3.0905853511295476
i support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy .    3.182617113521831
however , i do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used .    2.50700910654975
water , in this context , is a commercial commodity .    3.939413854134607
it is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life .    2.108980361844116
we see it as positive that an attempt is being made to reverse the trend towards water degradation , which is most alarming and which governments all too often tend to UNK under the carpet .    2.4310782053364743
we all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved .    2.6322645173917794
but it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated , and that action on this aspect will affect all the others .    2.978286134119785
the " UNK - chemical and ecological quality of water " was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals , and the adverse effects of other aspects was , at best , touched upon marginally .    2.854011726735985
it is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different member states , such as specific climatic conditions , water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year , the social , economic and ecological effects of applying standards , and also of the failure to do so .    2.8250658879914927
it was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects , which are very important for a country like portugal , which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio - economic development .    2.6708819483059685
but we also believe that , in many cases , the proposals put forward by the commission and the council represent too much of a step backwards , which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us .    3.502358004272854
. ( fr ) we are disappointed by the council ' s common position on this proposal for a framework directive .    3.3446158565116892
it is minimalist on a number of points , especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of , and conditions for , implementing the derogations .    2.799863269591144
however , the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the european union wishes to pursue with this text .    3.3085319053371345
the objective is of course to create , first and foremost , a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified .    2.87086081093426
however the union should be seeking , beyond that , to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater .    2.826643202097782
public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake , as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species .    2.8133025829863376
from this point of view , the common position is weak .    3.2665670584134516
i should like to see our parliament defend a more ambitious position than the council ' s position , but i should also like that position to be equally credible .    2.796186604579863
the " zero input " and " zero pollution " requirement , including for substances naturally present in water , is not realistic .    2.4012850008535374
i am not one of those meps who thinks that it is essential to adopt " extremist " amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the council of ministers .    2.479719734537619
on the contrary , i object to this systematically applied strategy .    2.2220915801371146
it damages parliament .    2.8195162943885013
our messages to our citizens and to the council are muddled and lack credibility .    3.5681081991032157
overly strict , unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are UNK .    3.1363974819500267
is that the message we want to send out ?    4.395660561517828
there is one other specific point which is dear to me : member states should be able , if they so wish , to set up trans - national water transfers .    2.4850353752699283
this type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity , which we have always defended , and , as such , should enjoy the widespread support of the european union in the context of the promotion of trans - european networks and regional policy ( through the structural funds ) .    3.468962872651708
i would like to remind the house that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans - european water networks two years ago and i would be most obliged if the european commission could shortly tell parliament what action it has taken on that report .    2.6976307849201024
.    2.489189446364389
( es ) we have seen a report concerned with water quality in europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war .    2.5065616196154927
we all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective , above all , given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment .    2.461973962173611
it is clear that this model ' s logic of private profit has been harmful , and therefore the ' polluter pays ' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences .    2.2606532509035873
however , apart from these principles , there is the consideration that water , as a common resource , cannot be subjected to the rules of the market .    3.328951493629361
surprisingly , i imagine with the best of intentions , this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers , and especially the agricultural sector , responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality .    2.4849278243415833
this means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water .    2.5206216647923925
by failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant , and is therefore not a problem , from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity , stifling the chances of any economic and social development , we are UNK the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon .    2.695295129062945
in the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity , which is scarce in some areas , while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use , to those who live in drought areas .    2.8559550634712876
as a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity , my vote has been consistent with what i have said , as an mep from one of the dry mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely , the region of UNK .    2.591611149386632
. on behalf of the european parliament labour party , i wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the lienemann report , we have certain reservations .    3.658934040398863
the timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable , but the timetable set by the council of UNK is too far in the distance .    3.214272743074567
we believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date .    2.300603227225676
we have voted against amendments nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal UNK pollution in all groundwater .    2.2387482494441695
we believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near UNK standard .    2.229776456052532
the UNK is the reason for our vote .    3.479035366263804
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed .    2.6143126017340697
the framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of community policy in this area .    2.6504151937987745
it has clear , ambitious objectives .    2.521737930485916
it sets environmental parameters close to zero .    2.5482207570209807
but we feel that it would be UNK not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet .    2.735457002098076
we need a timetable , by all means , but a more gradual timetable .    2.5647562074737613
the legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation , i . e . to stop discharges within 20 years , would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances .    2.4384164838333393
such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross - border areas and in candidate countries , thereby complicating enlargement .    2.43986656875019
i should like , naturally , to refer to a specific sector to which i am very closely attached , i . e . agriculture , the main water - consuming sector . agriculture must accept its share of ' polluter pays ' charges , and has in fact already started to do so , but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints , especially in arid regions .    2.6638412656756314
as regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances , i am of course in favour of controls , but the question arises of the legal basis , which comes under the euratom treaty .    3.261935622983132
andersson report ( a5 - 0033 / 2000 )    2.8447131804286747
the group for a europe of democracies and diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the andersson report . this does , of course , contain a number of good observations .    2.953480112657464
for example , it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that " the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the member states make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the member states ' social security systems " .    3.3230816579294746
now , the concept of " uniform harmonisation " is one of those muddled expressions which totally UNK the integration process in question . it is also true , as it states in the explanatory statement , that harmonisation could be damaging as " it might place greater demands on weaker member states at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security .    2.5141817983549495
no - one would benefit from this type of harmonisation " .    2.889443597951464
the situation , however , is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation , and uniform harmonisation into the bargain .    2.594616655060619
paragraph d points out that " the union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria " , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the ecofin council and the social affairs and employment councils .    2.952386262434504
finally , paragraph 7 emphasises that " the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination " . and , in this regard , we approach the heart of the matter .    2.6739104052544995
this project , with its social harmonisation , does not constitute social policy . instead , it is an extension to the eu ' s emu project , which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside emu and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship , namely great britain , sweden and denmark .    2.9403115612314137
it is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the emu project .    2.7792740684167105
i was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote , since i believe that , in essence , the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly , despite the fact that , as we all know , the governments of the 15 member states would like to reduce pensions to the minimum .    3.7513717609208372
the elderly are waiting for the european parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now .    3.178805097871176
the countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the european union that guarantee better social protection .    2.6389313906802294
. ( da ) the danish social democrats in the european parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our swedish social democratic colleague , jan andersson , on the commission ' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security .    2.62307576084389
the starting point for the commission ' s communication is the implementation of emu which , with its demand for stability and growth , creates the basis for the member states ' being able to maintain their social security arrangements .    3.2301319698263407
the report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but , rather , better use of available resources .    2.953696806016567
we also notice that , according to the explanatory statement , modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements , either , and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker member states at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back .    2.4220007952733056
no - one would benefit from this situation .    2.5774639025031316
both in the communication from the commission and in the report by mr andersson , it is emphasised that it is the member states which have responsibility for and , therefore , also determine the content of , social security arrangements .    4.498516790419029
cooperation on these matters within the framework of the eu should create added value , based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing , the aim being to define best practice .    2.924567485746021
. ( sv ) we consider that the report contains many practical proposals , which we support , but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report .    3.1810760288697746
in particular , we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the commission ' s becoming involved in telling the member states what to do ( see , for example , paragraph 7 ) .    2.948350284470989
we wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the member states , even if the enlargement of the eu requires a greater degree of coordination than there has been in the past .    3.344316752042953
. ( fr ) the current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment , poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending .    2.236364351222487
the policies of the european union also have much to answer for in this situation .    3.53379227652074
of course we need to modernise these systems .    3.0341609863129224
in france , in particular , we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions .    2.816723307790856
we also need to reform UNK management methods which create UNK , chaos and waste .    2.181181545799372
more importantly , we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic , monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and UNK the internal market so that we can create jobs .    3.260823919314715
the commission and the andersson report are not proposing a social policy ; they are giving brussels UNK decision - making powers as regards funding , i . e . as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of europe , which is why we voted against this text .    3.2739119995471584
social protection should be an expression , first and foremost , of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost , exclusively in fact , under the jurisdiction of the nation state .    2.8331035660813613
social protection should be based on the principle of national and community preferences .    3.6803782447585034
otherwise it is merely the financial processing , at the expense and to the detriment of european citizens , of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration .    3.1381487328712043
.    2.489189446364389
( sv ) we have abstained from voting for jan andersson ' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security .    2.3597176162869324
we are basically well disposed towards the european union .    2.741505587936821
as swedish liberals , we see european integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross - border problems such as the environment , trade , movement across borders , human rights and conflict management .    3.076918665432248
in these areas , europe ' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity .    2.7235126358646813
that is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the european union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see .    3.111264345066218
it must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the eu will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with , which is to say cross - border issues .    3.2346028494187906
all other questions ought to be dealt with at local , regional or national levels .    2.755792668621467
social policy is an example of an area in which the eu ought only to have limited powers , except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the union .    3.198367010266426
each member state ought to have full responsibility for , and the right UNK to decide upon , its social security systems .    3.2260647400791203
health care , child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational .    2.6675214448562725
the same applies to labour market policy .    2.640539341908247
we do not believe that common european legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security .    2.993380794357571
for us , it is important that the eu should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use .    3.596751586204738
that does not , however , prevent the member states from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere .    3.256828291173377
equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our liberal agenda .    2.5669467288926535
we wholeheartedly support , at national level , many of the ideas presented in mr andersson ' s report .    2.735219440425243
. ( it ) the report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in europe will be accompanied by an UNK process of cohesion .    2.6978576866944115
we therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions .    2.142188299758643
numerous policies have already gone in this direction , albeit UNK , and many more still need to do so before europe , in terms of subsidiarity , is seen as one house , not only by its own people , but also by those in the candidate countries .    3.336322798135588
moreover , the european welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation .    3.10552156820014
consequently , if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future , in light of the economic and employment changes taking place , as well as the requirements of society , modernisation is absolutely essential .    3.2860615975001926
there are three main aspects that need to be highlighted .    3.0046985353712574
the first is that economic policy , employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional .    2.958793012311125
the second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them .    2.660715116986612
nowadays , it is becoming more commonplace , as well as efficient , to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes .    2.847291381517537
but , in our view , that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced , either as regards the universality or , we hope , the quality of the basic social protection provided .    3.5680357003712384
it is , to a large extent , a principle of justice that UNK both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance , where , in particular , strategic coordination by the public authority is essential , even though it has been modernised .    3.0406372208659347
the third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the european union .    2.678793870454755
today , a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking , and the current systems are , in the main , run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual member states .    3.221155070513187
therefore , any modernisation process has to take account of economic , employment and social protection differences between the various countries , whether member states or candidate countries .    3.1313193104159724
what is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process , which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences , should have the will and the know - how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse .    2.909234079389161
it is , after all , a matter of civilisation , progress and common dignity for the present european union and a future enlarged community .    2.63125220996726
. ( sv ) the basic values common to the member states of the european union are based upon democracy , human freedoms and rights , and a social market economy .    2.9979787902208686
these values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us .    3.3763916020570814
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , it is the member states themselves which devise their own social security systems .    3.376992550649214
inhabitants of countries in the european union ought , nonetheless , to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection , irrespective of which country they live in .    3.5023321785554855
the report seeks " effective and ambitious fiscal coordination " , without going on to define more specifically what this means .    2.0181533659556123
as we see it , such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot , therefore , be supported .    2.4445901723088634
it is nonetheless important to clarify what role the eu is to play , and not to play , with regard to social security .    3.343598793093964
clarification of this kind is missing from the report , which is unfortunate .    4.216546733709874
. ( el ) on reading the commission ' s statement on social protection , which is UNK by so many good intentions , one wonders whether its authors and the working people in europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality .    3.191665886492465
one also wonders whether this ' coordinated modernisation strategy ' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people .    2.449090041999815
we agree with many of the rapporteur ' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the commission ' s and the council ' s intentions and plans concerning social protection .    3.3111003724885886
the general lines of the implemented economic policy , the stability pact and the strict convergence programmes , which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations , and the organisation of labour , along with commission and the esf decisions relating to salary and wage restraint , and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much - UNK monetary stability at all costs , leave no doubt about the new strategy ' s objectives and aspirations .    2.503991324035176
its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security , and for UNK social protection itself .    2.644258750105703
when social security has repeatedly , and in the words of many influential people , been characterised as a ' cost ' and an ' obstacle ' to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people - always , of course , on the pretext that this will create jobs - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability , with its dismal monetary - economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests , were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care .    2.2431560569444304
clearly , what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control , towards systems based on private insurance agencies , which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people , who besides the higher cost , will ' enjoy ' even more UNK social provisions .    2.214074635237437
the UNK of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the member states is not only unjustifiable , but , on the contrary , makes manifest the political UNK and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them , to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit .    3.0429214493258927
so how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed , impoverished and marginalised people , the ' working poor ' of part - time employment , and working conditions that are UNK from the policies implemented ?    2.6383446290697763
social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in europe , and were achieved after many years of UNK against the aspirations of big business , and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people .    2.5838138598582465
today , in the europe of unemployment and UNK , it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people , but this demands a different system of economic and social development , which the eu cannot possibly create , because of its nature and character .    3.7577021129124346
on the basis of these views , we wish to express our categorical opposition to the ' modernisation ' of the social protection system that the commission statement is promoting , and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the committee on employment and social affairs which is under discussion .    3.3880327611793817
that concludes the explanations of vote .    2.5670453643687146
( the sitting was suspended at 1 . 55 p . m . and resumed at 3 p . m . )    1.750481658625098
the next item is the debate on the council declaration on the establishing of the eu priorities for the next session of the un commission on human rights ( 20 march 2000 ) , including the situation in china .    2.964255179573118
mr president , i regret the absence of the presidency - in - office of the council . this is a council declaration , and i believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate .    3.4681669705504454
i think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need , which has been expressed by all the political groups , for parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the united nations commission on human rights in geneva , so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue , one which is so dear to this house .    3.3547556920613437
following the statement of the presidency - in - office of the council and the commission , i believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see .    3.9603781861745304
at a european union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory , since , for example , although the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is a common instrument in all member states , not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them .    3.238188580423887
another clear UNK in this area is the fact that the european union itself is not a signatory to the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails .    3.4348215724631403
i hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the european union charter on fundamental rights .    3.2902612354048753
with regard to foreign affairs , i believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution UNK illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism , mr president . issues such as the abolition of the death penalty , the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world , demand a clear , visible and effective response from the european union .    3.047980313211789
mr president , in a world such as this , which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation , and not only in the economic field , our responses , in order to be effective , must be concerted and coordinated .    3.522517598787412
in order to make our actions effective , we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present .    3.052706226905955
this parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the commission on human rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and , mr president - in - office of the council , this parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible .    3.542193922089139
soon , in may , the european commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the union ' s external relations .    4.3898953041248685
i would like to take this opportunity to ask the commission to take good note of this need for coordination , which i have just mentioned , and to seek new formulas which will strengthen the role played by the european union in the field of human rights and , in particular , by this parliament , especially from the point of view of coherence , recognising the good will of those third countries which accept the inclusion of the democratic clause .    3.1909563154771816
i believe that this should be applied to all areas , in particular also the budgetary area .    3.3809535965474593
lastly , i must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area , as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non - governmental organisations who act on the ground .    3.0316848277996677
the union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work .    2.827152432092206
mr president , commissioners , when this house is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance , if you will , that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue .    2.6962330117049587
the absence of the council , as well as of the majority of meps , shows just how great the divide is between our noble , elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day - to - day policies when it comes to human rights .    2.5405913024751547
i believe that , as a beginning , parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the geneva session to narrow that divide . it should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support .    2.660251801279443
we must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the UNK or abuses are being punished .    2.7941297355220525
the role of parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on , particularly at the level of prevention .    3.7655088998262007
in that sense , we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law .    3.086181457434504
it seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed .    2.6775472205537034
nowadays , there are many , perhaps too many , treaties on human rights . if those treaties remain mere expressions , they are no more than useless UNK of people ' s thoughts .    2.9672041601041297
the time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase , namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis , although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed .    2.894531468154356
i refer to the rome conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 member states of the union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an international criminal court .    3.0930765284953305
in my view , we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally .    3.209084910853966
we have often employed instruments which , at the formal level , make us feel comfortable , but which , in terms of practical results , are totally ineffectual .    2.871868056938342
by that i mean the use , and often abuse , of embargoes during recent years , and the over - cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the european union and third countries , where there have been human rights violations .    3.037953410938285
in particular , we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded .    3.274583257012183
globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process .    2.4507607262568483
many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights . the belief is widespread that many human rights , including the right to life , contradicted as it is by the death penalty , depend on certain variables , while globalisation , which often has a negative UNK , is in danger of becoming the catch - all for rights , actions and policies everywhere in the world .    2.6332939247929192
i would also mention the right to develop . it is the right of all peoples who , in turn , are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that , most importantly , is full of hope and personal growth , within each individual society .    2.906305716575371
all those aspects should be part of a rationale , a discourse and a contribution which the european union should bring to human rights .    2.7289451953885493
i hope that parliament ' s participation in the geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence . first and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects i have just mentioned as central to the identity of the european union and of the european nation , and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place .    2.9383967474149637
that is what we hope for and is the UNK message that we are sending our governments , even if it goes against their interests .    3.193898661708955
mr president , one of the saving features of this parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy : the flag flies high , as mrs malmström put it .    2.4239409068684075
at the same time , however , we shut our eyes to the union ' s own problems : to the violence , inequality , and fourth world reality , which is part of everyday life in the eu .    2.9940582153667075
it is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in geneva .    3.2718297358888497
it is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non - eu countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum - seekers , whose position is now becoming more difficult in the eu .    2.417199080575581
let us , in particular , focus attention on the re - admission clauses , which present a threat to the geneva convention and which should be blocked .    2.9630833903968745
unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum - seekers , we are not worthy of those european values which make up the european identity , as vaclav havel said here today , and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity .    2.770877480995511
i worked for many years on the south african truth and reconciliation commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open , european - style , UNK democratic society .    2.256969878736291
i fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction , towards european UNK and apartheid .    2.9807828958659344
mr president , commissioner , mr president - in - office of the council , in my view , the question which needs to be raised in geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty .    2.8050593211755794
we have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in geneva .    2.67207514441721
we failed at the general assembly last year on a UNK pretext , i refer to article 2 . 7 , which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts .    2.669495404684811
as mr patten said , and i would like to thank him for the positions which he defended , the crucial point is china .    2.787626159421879
unfortunately , the positions taken by the commission and the council , or at least the presidency , are more than just a hair ' s breadth apart ; this is serious , especially in the light of the council ' s UNK position on austria .    3.307358326226378
in my view , as far as china is concerned , and knowing that the european union ' s policy towards china has been a total failure , UNK constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or , worse , it has given the chinese new UNK for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms ( as mrs wallström has said with regard to the internet ) in all sectors , in tibet , in inland UNK , in eastern UNK .    2.5348946905506895
there is regression in every sector of chinese civil society .    2.1546458117792637
it is a fact : china is the major threat , the major threat to us , the threat which we must confront , the threat to peace .    2.8337458021047786
it is the UNK of democracy and you know as well as i that the chinese , the chinese leadership , is communist first and chinese second .    2.7475620023781757
china likes UNK .    2.908279822057973
until we have a firm position , we will achieve nothing with the chinese authorities .    3.372024689096159
i think we need to seize the opportunity .    3.120993202968762
we need to associate ourselves with the american initiative .    2.693216093665747
we need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted .    2.94977505853965
we need to work .    3.0808636353747767
the fifteen need to start work right now , with all the members of the united nations ; we need , at long last , to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position .    2.942801245267695
mr president , i would like to try to put a different perspective to this .    2.5380765075018212
as you know , on monday an UNK UNK went into UNK around a UNK - shaped asteroid called UNK which is not very far from earth .    2.5439707493588486
UNK show us that there is no life on the asteroid , but much further out in our UNK , the milky way , there are about 300 billion stars , many with planets .    2.7240480111307326
beyond the milky way there are 300 billion other UNK with countless stars and planets .    2.048270779088866
it is probable , therefore , that there is a lot of life out there , and much of it much more advanced than we are .    2.9708536095895512
bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the UNK stars , i invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us .    2.027569299374748
what do they see ?    2.9005892368492545
they see a beautiful planet , teeming with life , but they see its atmosphere being polluted and UNK up .    2.272106907824558
they see forests being cut down and UNK spreading .    2.3806714786712138
of the living creatures , they can see many animals that are treated UNK , rare ones becoming extinct for ever .    2.0160220810424883
how do they see the currently dominant species - that is us ?    2.6370201020164497
well , they see the planet ' s resources being unevenly spread .    2.470550177032028
they see land being fought over , medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted , books for schools - but not at all in the least - developed areas of our world , 50 % of the world ' s population never making a telephone call in their whole life .    2.477572963490748
what do they see about the relationships between human beings ?    2.3360830735683695
they see us killing each other .    2.6439656172858563
they see us restricting each other ' s liberties .    2.385502456367387
they see a never - ending series of local wars . they see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers , or treated as UNK or slaves .    2.0488360604539544
we all know the picture .    2.708167525564568
the un convention on human rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this .    2.506734638823998
we should salute it - and i think we do .    3.3273176417983508
only in europe are human rights enforceable in law .    2.55555906571559
here in the european parliament some of the members do not want the charter of rights , which is being discussed at the moment , to become enforceable in law .    4.284254642074229
i say : shame on them !    2.549676905798889
human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world .    2.934647728380178
that is the goal which we have to work towards .    3.733780478726641
much , as commissioner patten said , remains to be done .    2.7854441723325154
finally , if you asked me : what if there is no life out there among the stars , what if we are alone ? - which is an equally UNK - inspiring thought - i would say : do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly , before letting them go out to UNK other planets ?    2.6354684250397784
mr president , human rights are universal , UNK , interrelated and UNK .    3.0054226822415107
this well - known phrase , which is taken from the conclusions of the un world conference on human rights of 1993 , is known off by heart by many .    2.8673657848677214
that is positive .    2.9024262699078625
but what about the human rights policy within the eu itself ?    3.4306469373596227
does it reflect this vision of coherence ?    2.527483731145397
this question does not challenge the efforts made by the member states who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere , for example in china .    2.6953692409642453
no , mr president , i am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the european union itself .    4.637787782689373
a new government has come into power in austria , comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis - à - vis minorities .    2.414810402172553
human rights , which the eu embraces , are thus under threat , but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated .    3.304760249492932
there is , therefore a need for a fully - fledged human rights policy for and by the european union , a policy which promotes and UNK human rights within the eu itself .    3.292401912984084
such policy should comprise various components .    2.5020493550212515
firstly : a regulatory framework is needed , which spells out very clearly the rights which the eu intends to secure for its citizens .    2.4192501285310355
a start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter , but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists .    2.780929234662865
this is a political question which , in the short term , requires an answer from the igc and this parliament .    3.2404626462173756
secondly : a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark .    2.5851761733457224
the following spring to mind in this respect : the systematic UNK of documentation and information , professional forms of observation , the development of information campaigns , the use of cash to support democratic forces in the country concerned , a more creative deployment of the resources which are available through multilateral diplomacy , such as organised dialogue and fact finding missions and such like .    2.3798417160677126
thirdly : it will need to be made clear for each of the eu institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the european union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails .    3.64134868595093
the commission and the council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be .    2.579097338870943
this parliament is excluded from this , for our rules of procedure stipulate that the committee on civil liberties and internal affairs carries this responsibility .    2.9207788101089145
but i am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this parliament and that the aforementioned committee , of which i form part , has not been involved in this .    3.227975178319196
mr president , this parliament is fragmented and divided .    2.5870683596730992
for the sake of our credibility , we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the eu are different from human rights elsewhere in the world .    3.0436527158355853
i think that this will benefit our credibility in the un human rights committee .    2.5785565653901164
mr president , what will it take to make the debate on human rights something other than what it is today : an ideological instrument which helps to UNK peoples rather than free individuals ?    2.648783242494023
we must start by going beyond man , who is not the master of the universe , to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values , without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and UNK .    2.4424432858346865
we need , in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of europe , to go back to the natural order of the universe , i . e . to the creation , and beyond that still further , to the creator ' s intention .    2.8796073609840693
then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family , the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens ' rights are only respected within sovereign states .    2.679479084649323
secondly , the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited , as it is today , as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights , thereby denying the legitimacy and , if need be , the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect .    2.973141515258816
' no freedom for the enemies of freedom ' was what the advocates of the UNK terror were saying two centuries ago , the advocates of the revolution which proved , alas , to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes .    2.369700685153957
no human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the UNK of the new world order are saying today , the new world order which reigns almost UNK in financial circles , in international institutions , in the media and cultural networks , and in educational institutions , to mention but a few .    3.338041348872613
what is left , for example , of the right of austrians to choose their own destiny , if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner , as they were recently by you in portugal , mr president of the council .    2.470417764791534
i do not know if he is still present and can hear me .    2.237575988989674
what is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and UNK are persecuted , as the young UNK jean UNK was just yesterday before the court of appeal , in my home town of UNK - he was the subject of an absurd , arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor jean - olivier UNK , the UNK expression of UNK thinking and intellectual conformism ?    2.62021878764773
what of the human rights of the millions of french people who voted for the national front and who are deprived of any political representation and UNK daily , as they were on monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes , when the simple expression of justifiably UNK views by one of our colleagues , mr le pen , is used as a pretext for UNK condemnation , in violation of the law and in violation of all UNK of justice , fairness and morals , and when attempts are made , in violation of the clearest legislation , to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote , not received as a favour from the government .    2.48573658099096
in a word , i shall believe your talk about human rights in europe , fellow members , when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves .    2.7666781851374873
listen to the UNK voice of UNK in his letter to the americans , in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism , an individualism which , far from allowing people to flourish , paves the way for future dictatorship , in fact the worst kind of dictatorship , because those whom it UNK are not even aware of their terrible UNK .    2.4791322096735855
mr president , the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political UNK of the 20th century .    3.4680058352538095
the holocaust , fifty years ago , led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms .    3.8839149271687177
since the end of the cold war , compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation .    2.6153203874420394
leaders violating these principles now face international criticism , sanctions and are even brought to trial , such as ex - dictators like mr pinochet have experienced .    2.164088528052239
these developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very UNK .    3.596616310364452
especially in situations of war , civilians are given less consideration all the time .    2.358138196473965
it seems contradictory .    2.80679896859153
never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed .    2.237715866882924
never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries .    2.4402654247249376
yet the most basic rules of conduct are being UNK on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago .    2.5859684342915634
women are systematically raped .    2.709546177979632
children are UNK by force and deployed in battle .    2.533730840821979
excesses are no longer the exception , they have unfortunately become the rule .    2.852403384906452
too late , too selective and too fragmented : this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community .    3.025897480380186
first of all , the policy comes too late .    2.5846728103286107
both in UNK and kosovo , the un , despite the many warnings , appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres , as president havel pointed out this afternoon .    2.3885325321784405
fifty years later , we are still unable to prevent genocide .    3.594103573736448
we should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency .    2.3802725564804024
control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this .    2.52773062272443
the human rights policy is also too selective .    3.1787550344591873
the months of nato bombardments of kosovo and the mediation attempts in the middle east are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in africa .    2.44205769598916
i cannot shake off the impression that , when it comes to human rights , despite all the rhetoric , africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the portuguese presidency . this is something which i very much regret .    3.0900568126873855
the impression that UNK get , namely that they are inferior world citizens , is not UNK .    3.3978455909746463
but above all , the human rights policy is too fragmented .    3.532079817820383
we are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or europe .    2.3580456598679893
take sudan .    3.1355373076396913
the international community is sending conflicting messages to this country .    2.473366613541347
britain has re - opened its UNK in UNK .    2.5326072951514553
canada has invited the UNK for peace talks .    2.7835184319557658
there is a need for more coordination , more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided .    2.420601592589444
only then can we follow in the UNK of the UNK of the universal declaration of human rights .    3.804186631066944
mr president , i would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home .    2.430146856476391
but unfortunately , as we speak today in the safety of this chamber , human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world .    3.0036390268102493
sometimes the more we speak , the less we hear - motions : words ; conventions : words ; treaties : words - if we are not careful , words themselves become a substitute for real action .    2.1965821493438793
yet words spoken , written or signed are not in themselves enough .    2.378738255505532
look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities , groups and individuals - the list is shameful and UNK .    2.3996285207660693
can anyone argue with any UNK that women are treated equally and fairly , that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion , belief , gender , disability , age , sexual orientation , opinion , political affiliation etc ?    1.943810206610772
the UNK of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination .    2.5401658587754943
even within the eu citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions .    2.711920467864015
every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to UNK ethnic minorities .    2.467330809115392
quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created .    2.4395754948509625
and so long as people do not have equality before the law , this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded .    2.9739731760955896
in our enlargement process in the eu we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities .    3.4685639324603423
we must not waiver in that commitment .    2.4834987099985546
but we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies .    2.279205914162906
yes , conventions have been signed , but action is needed .    2.343494312426915
i would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices , eternal vigilance , not just outside our borders but within .    2.450092211086593
that is why i would welcome an annual member state report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken . because what happens in each member state happens to every single one of us .    2.381842588359612
what happens in another part of the world affects us .    3.4191429999351373
pinochet in chile is as relevant as haider in austria .    2.172919989759193
human rights and civil liberties are UNK linked .    2.9442601385880884
human rights do not exist in isolation , they are connected to our development policies , our economic policies , our home affairs policies , indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions .    2.6594676913350037
i would repeat what mr patten said : we must engage , we must inform , educate and thereby effect real and lasting change .    2.549406425509816
mr president , " europe stands for ideals , values and principles .    2.2971490682776934
we must emphasise europe ' s spiritual history .    2.919797955884269
together , we must re - establish the values which unite europe .    3.115890825611084
spiritual values have been disseminated from europe throughout the globe .    2.1978041754857656
we must live with our consciences . "    2.5436371029170908
these were the words spoken three hours ago in this chamber by the president of the czech republic , vaclav havel .    2.627296637628414
in an extraordinarily UNK speech , characterised by wisdom , historical knowledge , an understanding of the human heart and insight into europe ' s spiritual and christian heritage , he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity .    2.0691046346418878
we should be grateful that there are heads of state like vaclav havel in our europe .    2.8856072749673918
i wish to discuss two matters .    2.631712330744515
first of all , civil society .    2.529675874277711
vaclav havel stated that , in eastern europe , the communist regimes UNK destroyed civil society : national movements , churches and the independent trade unions .    2.4652651363141675
the same is happening in china in connection with the falun gong movement and with the catholic and protestant churches .    2.5812906498951613
it is happening with UNK in tibet .    2.8258775725769985
we must never forget to defend civil society .    2.3117324924389706
i also want to mention the death penalty .    2.7703699113941784
like my own country , sweden , the eu bases its view of human beings upon the equal , unique and UNK value of every human .    2.535250789586999
on the basis of this principle , human beings should always have the chance to UNK themselves .    2.988042208878872
try telling that to the governments of the united states , russia and china .    3.1143400754252837
mr president , president - in - office , commissioner , i believe the approach of eu member states at geneva should be to prioritise the situations in kosovo , mexico , UNK UNK , sierra UNK and china .    2.98297719800167
in relation to china , we should not be UNK from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked .    3.186714242358004
however , it is imperative that the eu speaks and acts as one , and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve .    2.4615954469833765
however , if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at geneva , then the office of the high commissioner for human rights must be provided with the necessary resources .    3.507656984319989
the financial resources of the united nations are spread very UNK and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat .    2.5301664467913882
resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights , strategic planning , the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the united nations .    2.660596354461733
to this end the high commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for usd 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks .    2.196812242764624
the european union and its member states should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds .    2.6884300507644685
in so doing , we would not only UNK the united states into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to un funding , but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric .    3.0727367185750682
mr president , this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual un human rights convention and the commission ' s and council ' s efforts in this respect .    3.3166958706229024
i would first of all like to say that i am very pleased with the contributions made by mr patten and the minister , and i welcome the fact that both china and cuba are on the agenda .    3.488060300866109
cuba is the last UNK of dictatorship in south america and we must be mindful of this , with all due sympathy to cuba .    2.945814222777107
it is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy .    2.4035561377022105
i would , during my two minutes , like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart .    2.510077554171551
the first country is indonesia .    2.5885347173251914
we are naturally delighted that indonesia is under new rule and that mr wahid and mrs UNK are the new president and vice - president .    2.366394715819762
we are also pleased that the situation in timor is slowly moving in the right direction .    2.64790925596149
but i can report that in the moluccas , an area just north of timor , the violence is still not under control .    2.637810869373581
this has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years .    2.5090054476629025
tens of thousands of people are on the run .    3.4624188835790064
the situation is badly managed .    2.9776530093482134
i know that tomorrow , or the day after tomorrow , an important programme will be shown on dutch television , in which an appeal will be made for observers . this is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on , so that at least a record can be made , not least for the future , for human rights committees , of what has been happening .    3.1695554946626063
my urgent request , which has been echoed many times in resolutions , is the following : could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the moluccas ?    2.6295305462614365
surely thousands of people killed , thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough .    2.279960583148635
my second country - i will be brief as mr patten knows this country very well - is burma .    2.56128942624452
surely we cannot just keep silent about burma .    2.4841761848307877
i have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion .    2.403470722324589
for ten years now , the elected president of that country has been under house arrest .    2.7255949995459305
numerous mps have been killed or have UNK the country and only a few are left in burma .    2.675713952444682
there are hundreds of thousands of refugees in UNK and india from burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention .    2.768229445501764
in my opinion , burma should be put back on the agenda , too , certainly in the wake of indonesia ' s u - turn .    2.5699218854520147
surely we cannot tolerate the fact that mrs UNK san UNK UNK feels completely left in the UNK , even by europe .    3.0917657708386996
my request is , in fact , to put this country back on the top of the agenda .    3.258973561946017
mr president , mr president - in - office , commissioner , economic UNK cannot be the only factor that determines the european union ' s status in the world .    2.830249939480044
one of the eu ' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights , as exercised both within the union and by our partners .    3.1554397629318047
the european parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights , and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self - interest and " national interests " , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the member states and even by other european union institutions .    2.9193979658817084
we can therefore safely say , for example , that the european parliament has never allowed the situation in east timor to be forgotten , which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people , who always opposed occupation by indonesia .    2.8697766828169855
by the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to indonesia , a stance that the council unfortunately did not take into account .    2.454645701844917
but it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to UNK instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position .    2.3176920204029914
it is vital that when violations are committed , the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity , whoever or wherever they may be - in indonesia or angola , in cuba , china or burma , whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers , humble foot - soldier or general or even a minister .    2.11508731216562
justice needs to be done in east timor .    3.7335921674024846
president wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with .    2.473328866718575
the specific reference in this resolution to east timor , on the initiative of the ppe group , is a timely one .    3.294581702048465
someone must be held to account for the events that took place there , some of which i saw with my own eyes as a representative of this house ; they cannot go UNK .    2.724410403522247
it is impossible to talk about east timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of timorese refugees living on indonesian soil in UNK conditions , under the control of indonesian soldiers and militias , and being used as bargaining chips .    2.2398919139293394
this is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency .    2.3592844869370637
.    2.489189446364389
( pt ) mr president , i would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the council presidency , and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen member states are to approve in the council . our experience of previous sessions of the human rights commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the european union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the commission , and it is important to maintain this .    2.930871990352558
i would also like to stress , as many members have highlighted , that human rights policy is at the heart of europe ' s identity and that respect for human rights should be seen as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the european union .    2.948923461095222
hence the need for the most coherent european human rights policy possible , which of course means that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous positions where we consider a state of affairs to be unacceptable , and i have in mind , in particular , the references that many members have made to china .    3.1174166251811517
but we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other members about other countries , notably indonesia , east timor , the moluccas and burma .    2.4701525819054644
i could not conclude without mentioning mr van hecke ' s speech in particular , in which he referred to the human rights situation in africa and to the role and priorities of the portuguese presidency , and questioned the sincerity of the priority we are giving to relations with the european union .    2.9777507860515406
i would simply like to say that the portuguese presidency has , in these two short months , organised the first development council , admittedly an informal one , whose agenda was rightly dominated by eu - africa relations . indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen member states to meet in lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered .    2.433691626886145
furthermore , i cannot stress enough the significance of our having concluded important negotiations on the new convention to succeed the lomé convention , and the fact that , following extremely complex and difficult negotiations , we have succeeded in organising - or making preparations for the organisation of - the first eu - africa summit .    2.9111068883572773
for all these reasons i thought it essential to reply directly to mr van hecke ' s question on this issue .    2.4963191134194997
. mr president , this has been a very useful debate .    3.7674990940317272
one or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully .    3.0994157144872476
for example , mrs maij - weggen referred to both indonesia and burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there .    2.3029351052993694
what i would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate .    2.7190798797971705
one of the very first speakers , mr UNK , spoke of the remarks made earlier today by mr havel .    2.989713643296045
it was a remarkable speech and i hope that mr gollnisch , who is no longer able to be with us , was able to hear that speech as well .    3.150648976732538
i also hope that , if there is any life in outer space , as has been speculated by mr newton dunn , it was tuned in to mr havel ' s speech as well .    2.7492269322470864
mr havel reminded us that the union is not just about markets , about gdp growth , it is a union of values that is reflected in the treaties and is reflected in our obligations in the whole area of external assistance , reflected quite specifically in what we are charged to do .    3.164454136986136
how do we implement what the treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes ?    2.319772700915488
one or two honourable members , mr UNK and mr UNK , spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality .    2.920120105766389
she said that she had received a letter from the chinese ambassador , a very UNK and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country , to tell her that she was wrong and the european parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in china .    2.53547216800517
i think after her speech she will receive a UNK of letters from the chinese authorities .    2.514978944061792
she will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in china .    2.750901016650791
i think she was reflecting the views of many non - governmental organisations , many people who admire chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in china today .    2.524213575235335
of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action , and the very first speech by mr salafranca mentioned two issues apart from geneva which represent actions , one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the european parliament on behalf of the european taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about eur 100 million that is spent through programmes , for which i am responsible , mainly going to non - governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation .    3.2226121512603347
we will want to share with parliament , as UNK say , our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead .    2.3759070593872136
there is also the question which was referred to by mr salafranca , who i am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate .    2.595382156285759
there is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy .    3.583472851503998
i want to remind parliament that the commission will be publishing , before the middle of the year , a comprehensive , intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy .    2.957789569356642
it is immensely important , and if i had not thought that already , having listened to the remarkable speech by mr havel earlier in the day i would have certainly come to that conclusion .    2.5099692287688846
it has been a useful debate .    3.0138910509962002
i hope we can have further debates like this .    2.436316109552556
i hope we can have , in particular , debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters , where people are still being tortured , where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this house takes for granted , as i do .    2.87500885790446
i have received 7 motions for resolution , pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present statement .    2.226745704149229
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place on thursday .    2.108742670373165
cyprus and malta    4.125490636449909
the next item is the joint debate on :    2.0397628948456488
the council statement on the position of the european union on developments concerning cyprus ;    3.499106865047717
the report ( a4 - 0029 / 2000 ) by mr brok , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the proposal for a council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre - accession strategy for cyprus and malta [ com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - 0308 / 1999 - 1999 / 0199 ( cns ) ] .    2.1353354205535937
mr seixas da costa has the floor on behalf of the council .    2.760463429909276
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the presidency of the council of the european union , i would like to present to you certain information about the re - opening of the intra - cyprus negotiations and recent developments in this area .    2.8831448223191867
i think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the european union and turkey have created a new UNK , at community level , which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two cypriot communities .    3.3323538858116266
at the beginning of december 1999 , the first round of negotiations were held in new york , after an interruption of several years in negotiations between the cypriot communities in the north and south of the island .    2.6188333434696456
these negotiations took the form of indirect discussions UNK by the un special representative , álvaro de UNK .    2.578919789697512
a further round was held in january this year , starting on 31 january , and a third round is scheduled to start on 23 may in new york .    2.499027782117526
there is a possibility , which has not yet been absolutely confirmed , that continuous and direct discussions may take place , with work continuing until september this year .    2.4648840870686923
these discussions essentially cover four areas : security , the structure of government , territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation , as a result of the situation following the partition of the island .    2.5242390318053127
however , agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues , and the representative of the northern part of the island , UNK UNK , has suggested three new topics : sovereignty , confidence - building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island .    3.085300317980761
the discussions held so far have essentially resulted in two developments . the first is the possibility of opening up a direct information channel between the european union and the north of the island , without this necessarily UNK recognition of this part of the island as a legal personality at international level , but as a means of facilitating adoption of the acquis communautaire with a view to eventual accession of the whole island , if a solution can , in the meantime , be found to the broader problem of the partition of the island .    2.9085253241153133
the second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the secretary - general of the united nations at the end of the first day ' s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island .    2.942756754878893
this is the position of the secretary - general of the united nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis .    3.137762161672097
certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations , in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the united states and the united kingdom , in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure , which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the secretary - general of the united nations .    2.9101540366797716
this will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 april .    2.6568053814555284
furthermore , the portuguese presidency of the european union has decided , following the example of previous presidencies , to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue .    3.1980579587558156
this representative has already contacted all these parties and has , in close cooperation with the representative of the secretary - general of the united nations , been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds .    2.799287014852579
in particular , we intend that the european union should maintain a constant profile on this issue , and of course all the more so since cyprus is a candidate for membership of the european union with negotiations at a fairly advanced stage . this naturally raises certain expectations and means that the role of the european union is of some relevance in this context .    2.942789554292599
the approach that we have been following in these discussions , and our participation in them , essentially turns on taking advantage of a certain desire to alleviate the tensions that exist , based on a conviction - which appears to be widely shared - that it is necessary to continue to negotiate , and that continuing negotiations and maintaining their impetus also give rise to hopes that a definitive solution can be found .    2.634940550365125
there is also another important aspect which i referred to at the beginning of my statement , and this relates to turkey ' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession .    2.910020187347116
we believe that it is not only necessary to read the conclusions of the helsinki european council with some care and attention , but that we should also take advantage of the willingness of the turkish authorities to help to resolve this situation .    3.023484349214459
i was able to talk to prime minister UNK ecevit about this issue when i visited ankara myself , and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with turkey ' s particular approach to this question , i believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss .    3.047530905117975
this window of opportunity involves combining various factors , one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between turkey and the european union .    2.9042568864916922
this is key as regards the future of this issue .    3.5125763564975
on the other hand , we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the european union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the commission and the cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged . this would not , let me make this quite clear , imply any kind of formal recognition .    3.257271555535135
nevertheless , we believe , and i think this is also how the commission sees things , that the whole process of approximation with the acquis communautaire with a view to overall integration of the island in the european union through accession at some point in the future implies involving the communities in the north of the island as soon as possible . it may also give the european union access to data enabling it to justify accession , as part of its efforts to assess accession conditions .    3.2247272141528507
furthermore , this means that we in the council - and i think that parliament will join us in this - should encourage the commission ' s involvement in this undertaking .    3.903165339703405
it is essential for us to send the commission a message of confidence about its role in this area .    3.139903060112462
lastly , i believe - and this is also the presidency ' s intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the united nations , given the UNK , intelligent and capable way in which the secretary - general , and the un organisation in general , have conducted these discussions , and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties ' positions .    3.6656027977395174
as i said at the beginning , the conclusions of the helsinki european council last december have had a visible impact on the way the positions of the various parties to this process have developed .    3.093139792150506
the nicosia government has expressed its satisfaction with the helsinki conclusions , which open up the way to accession to the european union without solving the partition of the island beforehand .    2.685920987774868
nevertheless , i have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition , which will evidently imply some concessions .    2.7266247151626337
this is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island .    2.6612727422066604
on the other hand , the turkish cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that turkey ' s application for membership of the european union may lead to greater flexibility in ankara ' s position on this .    2.9025570608803446
i believe that , despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island , these points , which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides , may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution .    2.556521962410326
it is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present , which is the extremely positive trend in relations between UNK and ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the greek foreign minister , UNK UNK , and the turkish foreign minister , UNK UNK .    3.1442450198008474
we believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome .    3.114189175423556
as far as we , the council presidency , are concerned , we will continue to follow these developments very closely , and we will certainly cooperate with the secretary - general and his personal representative on this matter .    3.562036469930862
we will make the community institutions aware of what we are able to do , and what is possible in general , as regards coordination , not just at political level but also as regards what the commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process .    3.377183192330045
in particular , we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue .    2.704457906050766
mr president , we have listened to the statements by the council and the commission and i would like to make the following observations .    3.7392567735070004
mr president - in - office of the council , i appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the turkish cypriot side , but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one UNK that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition , even though you stressed that this is not the case .    2.4448395697856706
for example , i would not refer to the government of nicosia .    3.9186259114993653
it is the cypriot government , mr president - in - office , not the government of nicosia .    2.8442824933562236
that government has proposed a way in which the turkish cypriot side can take part , and i think it would be right for the council and the commission to urge the turkish cypriot side to take part UNK in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the republic of cyprus .    3.7618938582014727
i cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently , nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies .    2.1922261856014003
nor can i understand the pressure applied by parliament to include the funds in chapter 7 for the pre - accession strategy . how can the whole of the european union treat , in this way , two small countries situated on its periphery ?    2.8345127614479027
not only are they countries which the european union needs , but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union .    2.961514237994851
this is a small political decision which would bring major benefits , especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state , to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the republic of cyprus , genuinely , to be rid of occupying forces .    2.6480832983769993
mr president , we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre - accession strategy for cyprus and malta .    2.4250157573174063
this proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and , once it is implemented , will replace the financial protocols which have now expired .    2.592035541226237
pre - accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the community acquis .    3.1600947595409195
the commission ' s analysis has in fact shown that , although classified as high income countries by the world bank , cyprus and malta have the same difficulties as the UNK in transposing community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity .    2.544959053616423
it was pointed out , during the discussion of mr brok ' s excellent report in committee , that both countries can also benefit from the meda budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest .    2.6554330984687904
i would be grateful if the commissioner could explicitly confirm that .    2.223684683957479
as far as cyprus is concerned , part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the greek and turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all .    2.7567605606915206
since 4 july 1990 , when cyprus applied to join the eu , the european parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the security council of the united nations .    3.070501280254844
in april 1999 , parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of cyprus should benefit the whole island , and help towards a political solution , but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution .    2.5077585299295793
in other words , accession should not be held hostage to a political solution .    2.7827787044510304
the two processes are separate processes .    2.562792880000935
this unequivocal position on the part of the european parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy .    3.670898657736915
we must therefore welcome the fact that the helsinki european council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions , and i quote , that " if no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations , the council ' s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition " .    2.7281419893684045
the position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the european union and turkey and between greece and turkey will bear favourably on the turkish cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations .    2.8079162592260394
the presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever .    2.491888816350863
on the contrary , it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when cyprus joins the european union and prepares for a turning point in its history .    2.8914919513018007
mr president , i want to say that i share the other rapporteurs ' delight at the fact that better opportunities are now to be UNK for making further progress in cyprus in the light of the improvement in relations between turkey and the eu and between turkey and greece .    2.8133651074652115
however , i also think that we in the eu should be making a constructive contribution .    3.828099356857436
i also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements , which we must solve .    3.318988509768699
there is , of course , the question of pre - accession aid , and this belongs in category seven .    3.45954944148695
last year , parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four , and the two applicant states are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant states from central and eastern europe , as they , in fact , should be , according to the declarations from the helsinki summit .    3.0123719352514335
resources should therefore be set aside from category seven , where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out .    3.0527316493782095
this is the crux of the matter .    2.3943729561846365
with regard to the amount which is quoted in the brok report ( eur 130 million ) , i also want to say , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money .    2.590007486063945
the most important thing is that a multi - annual programme be guaranteed , and in the correct category , so that it might be possible to begin making plans where cyprus and malta are concerned .    3.0371043850915447
mr president , the group of the greens / european free alliance support the decision adopted by the european council in helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of cyprus to the european union .    2.5333966747845684
it is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full .    2.4650132035451993
but we are also convinced that , despite improved relations between the turkish and greek populations , it is not enough .    3.166412455540926
the conflict in cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future .    2.5313492995675904
in particular , we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of UNK and UNK the island .    3.529332990408193
the european union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support , although that is important , by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence - building programmes .    2.3174203789745165
i must say that UNK UNK ' s presence here in the european parliament is sadly missed . his efforts to build peace should serve as an example , to all of us , on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved .    3.0333802855475542
mr president , the reference to dialogue between the two cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNK reminds us of the fact that , 26 years after the UNK of the island by the turkish army , nearly 40 % of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers , heavy UNK is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present , in total violation of the resolutions by the security council of the united nations on this matter .    2.6474149828648947
what can the european union do , without interfering in internal affairs in cyprus , to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the european community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the union within the next few years ?    3.214298705158934
i have listened to the somewhat UNK talk and UNK on the part of the council which , in my view , need clarifying .    3.2917770378462023
i think that we need , first and foremost , to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such cases in mind , i . e . the resolutions of the united nations .    2.7957312561924668
the security council feels that the solution to the cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two - zone , twin - community federation , in other words a single state , as mr verheugen mentioned , consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities .    2.4602301245753746
cyprus should be one sovereign state , with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be UNK .    2.5074833166326207
the international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force .    2.2513299553324964
secondly , the european union stands to gain , in my view , by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the helsinki european council .    2.9351743013942797
the solution to the cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to cyprus ' s accession to the union , as mr poos has reminded us .    2.861636892700727
if it were , turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of cyprus to the european union , which is , of course , unacceptable .    3.2143884786240617
thirdly , we must not , in turn , allow the position taken by the helsinki european council to UNK our efforts to resolve the cypriot question before cyprus joins the union .    2.996491090724
from this point of view , the other decision taken at helsinki , namely to grant turkey candidate status , gives the fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with ankara can and , in my view , should , include a determination to ensure that turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united cyprus and peace in the eastern mediterranean .    2.6150256189536485
mr president , there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to cyprus and malta is important .    2.655245341038643
the big question , however , is from what budget heading should this aid be financed ?    2.591092448471595
the council and commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4 .    2.500833693473262
this is in line with the budget order issued by parliament in december last .    2.794752489410826
the rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes UNK cyprus and malta under category 7 .    2.6575918622014076
the committee on budgetary control has even suggested postponing approval of the brok report until the council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7 .    2.376377049794474
this is an extremely risky strategy .    2.668826706760483
in fact , the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in parliament .    2.6131126705679786
cyprus and malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the council and parliament regarding the height of the ceilings .    2.805060603947942
moreover , what is the real significance of financial ceilings if they are increased for every new action ?    2.7459703317175492
i would therefore advocate that the eur 15 million in category 4 be dropped , in line with the commission ' s proposal .    2.3998980518465816
a multiannual budget of the commission later on in the year , may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years .    2.959508398157387
mr president , all over the world work is being done to resolve long - standing conflicts and bring together communities divided by history and by old tribal UNK and hatreds .    1.9981704442719725
now is the time to devote our time and energy to UNK cypriots from both sides of the " green line " in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long .    2.298766765990286
we all know that special care is needed to ensure that cyprus is brought successfully into the european union , and the decisions taken at helsinki give an added dimension to this debate , with the acceptance of turkey as a candidate country .    3.075465841213623
i hope that the decisions taken at helsinki lead to progress on the cyprus issue .    2.557823306971037
i hope this signals a new era of hope for cyprus .    2.4165861604626095
i hope that turkey begins to play a constructive role in the cyprus issue .    2.640654560095559
i am delighted to hear the words of support from the council and the commission for the un and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in cyprus .    2.9939279496045548
i very much welcome the commission ' s support for that UNK , UNK , federal cyprus for which the un has campaigned for so long and which both the greek cypriot side and the turkish cypriot side should be working hard to bring about .    2.715007996874715
i welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the greek government and the turkish government .    3.1920908897489553
i hope that has an encouraging effect on the cyprus talks .    2.6924251363251064
i hope that the accession money available to assist cyprus is used partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuilding of trust and that both sides of the divided communities in cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it is given .    2.294741263693226
we all , throughout the european institutions - in parliament , the council and the commission - should be doing our best to aid cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which brings together these two communities which have been divided for too many years .    2.9679712528293556
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner verheugen , the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an UNK for coherent work on the part of the commission .    2.4035753927996337
rather , the way in which these aid measures have been UNK together smacks of UNK to me .    3.0113649960232727
this applies both in terms of the substance and the financial aspect .    3.0771855182934202
in my view , it will hardly enable us to present the accession activities conducted by the union to the citizens of cyprus and malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their while joining .    3.4290549950136606
as vaclav havel rightly said today , the european union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual .    2.8544218328454645
as far as the citizens are concerned , it is what a regulation can do for them that matters .    3.308575381641378
we will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned .    2.5368306587402265
it is UNK and contains UNK paragraphs , which is no way to set a UNK example .    3.0344991344830383
the quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria : is it decentralised , is it transparent , is it accessible to the citizens and does it work ?    2.6323226042431394
nonetheless , as far as the divided island of cyprus is concerned , overall , this pre - accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge .    2.818055360450686
in my view , it is the task of the european union to employ all instruments , including this one , so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means .    3.035787188618656
both the commission and the council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well .    2.6292923778010304
i am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect .    3.3865032531038253
i believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in cyprus before admitting this country to the european union .    2.459102381684934
mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , the view of the greek communist party is that the main problem of cyprus is not its accession to the european union but the occupation of 40 % of its territory by turkey , which has continued for 26 years .    2.986740751224962
regardless of the national origin of each cypriot , the future of the cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country .    2.532343027920739
the only acceptable solution that guarantees the future , that leaves no room for foreign interventions , like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years , is a unified and federal cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the un ' s security council .    2.883107924962263
the key to solving the cyprus problem is in the hands of the turkish government , which supports and encourages the intransigence of the turkish cypriot leader UNK UNK .    2.495988833091845
for its part , the european union , with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights , has never been moved by the UNK of the cypriot people , by the problem of greek and turkish cypriot refugees , by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of cyprus , or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by turkey in the occupied areas .    2.9384660888640735
even in this chamber , the council ' s representative referred to the north of cyprus and not to the occupied territories .    3.7688903260436617
the recent helsinki decision to grant turkey accession country status , even though it has made not the slightest UNK over the issue of its occupation of cyprus , for example , by reducing its military presence there or giving back UNK , is clearly encouraging turkey ' s intransigence .    2.524541995897772
it is not by chance that , immediately after helsinki , the turkish prime minister , UNK ecevit , stated that the cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974 .    2.2893788226836866
encouraging turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the un secretary general .    2.754514632626312
on their course towards accession , the people of cyprus have already lost a great deal , but stand to lose even more .    2.5111112207103097
the application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the cypriot economy , especially in agriculture . it entails the liquidation of the public sector , and it UNK and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in cyprus .    2.5683104636015206
mr president , i beg your pardon , but the french interpreter made a small error , on the most sensitive word in the debate , during the translation of what mr alyssandrakis just said .    2.847055712970766
i just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity .    3.5034226007629137
mr alyssandrakis was translated as saying " the UNK solution would be best " .    2.1005973078410873
obviously , he said " the federal solution would be best " .    2.314455497817059
it is a most important point and needs to be clarified , mr president .    3.1842206565751763
thank you very much for the clarification mr wurtz .    2.2720136293589963
mr president , malta and cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland europe .    2.65825305607527
the maltese in particular have been very good at UNK in hostile geographical and geopolitical UNK .    2.3124806930406097
their success has relied in great part on their enterprise , their dynamism and their flexibility .    2.0519362968982677
malta has UNK light and heavy industry , growing financial services , good agriculture , magnificent tourism and an UNK range of employment opportunities , all of this on an island virtually UNK of natural resources .    2.159791204525619
i am certain , therefore , that an island such as malta , with its population of UNK 000 cannot accommodate the UNK of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater .    2.7173879850421425
thus , when i look at this proposed instrument i do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the UNK of mother europe .    2.880476238139025
we should not be UNK these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction , giving them money to absorb laws which are as UNK to their culture as a black hole is to mother earth .    2.3714464370267576
the eu should leave cyprus and malta alone .    2.805200545054875
it seems to me that the only people in malta that want this are the political class , and i shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the maltese people are the winners .    2.3556530033074856
mr president , this is one of the few occasions when , from what the speakers have said in this parliament , from all sides of the house , there is clearly the greatest convergence of views on the cyprus issue and , of course , on the pre - accession process for cyprus and malta .    3.3511471760766662
this means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the cyprus problem .    3.657725516172845
at the same time , however , it means that both the council and the commission have a very strong mandate , so that the strength of opinion expressed by all the european parties , and all the peoples , can empower their political ability to address the problem .    3.1806399011192195
helsinki was an historic event , an historic turning - point and an historic new reference point .    2.1195542382426185
if , for any reason , the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else , if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude , they will be making a tragic mistake .    2.739879986225742
conditions are ripe .    3.0085454158819744
what is needed from the european commission , the council and everyone else , is a quiet determination , a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both cyprus and malta without UNK , granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession , so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about .    3.093303126972963
to this end , the brok report is a good instrument and it is really a bit distressing that , because this is a joint debate , it is politically overshadowed by the political position of the council and the commission and we cannot therefore say more about this good report .    3.811512092344984
in any event , the outcome is in your hands .    2.4402814068795604
the outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions , to the extent that we are providing you with options .    3.002239571311653
now , as regards the brok report , cyprus and malta are the last of the mediterranean islands , and , unless i am mistaken , the last islands anywhere in europe which have not UNK to the european union .    3.08946880325499
from that standpoint , UNK ' s island , as cyprus is known , and the pirates ' island , as we UNK say of malta with great UNK , are two jewels which should be welcomed into the european union without delay .    2.9542358460839813
they have healthy economies , high - level economic relations , and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the european union ' s political will .    3.2852589533920624
in conclusion , since i do not think i need to say much , given the unanimity that exists here , i just want to make one brief remark to the president - in - office . i think that there are some peculiarities in his position .    3.2685860301781045
i hope there has been an interpretation error , and that he will clarify the matter in his follow - up speech .    3.0706603764588443
. ( pt ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i have listened to your comments very carefully , and in particular to the rather emotional comments about cyprus , especially in defence of the present legal situation in cyprus , which the european union specifically acknowledges by recognising the relevant resolutions of the united nations security council .    2.8907405146489182
mr wurtz , in no way can it be said that the council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue : the council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in cyprus .    2.983947481553966
moreover , it was this situation and this interpretation which led the council to take the decision it took in luxembourg at the end of 1997 , when it decided to take the first steps in the accession process for the republic of cyprus to join the european union .    3.2004793336935893
i hope that honourable members will realise that , regardless of the more or less emotional statements made about issues of this kind , the day - to - day reality of international negotiations normally forces governments to adopt a somewhat more flexible stance - and when i say governments i mean all governments .    2.3837314363034827
in fact we need more emotional statements to remind us that all these issues have a human side .    2.825289741182324
but we also need to be aware that it is by virtue of rational political UNK , and flexibility in negotiations , that we are able to find solutions to the major disputes which have ultimately led to many tragedies in history .    3.2213517900008504
regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame , the relevant united nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - i believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up , in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one .    2.9053441831543814
the european council in helsinki had the courage to take certain decisions , and i believe that various aspects of these decisions have already recognised the real value of these opportunities which , as i said at the beginning of my first speech , represent a window of opportunity .    2.86037537111677
we will not achieve concrete results during this stage of negotiations , which is a delicate and sensitive phase , by exploiting tensions .    2.53732703552932
no , we should continue to make progress by working UNK to support the special representative of the secretary - general of the united nations with his remit .    3.0148818324601647
the european union ' s position on this is crystal clear , and i do not think it is worthwhile second - guessing particular phrases in the council ' s conclusions or in any other statement .    3.1332765717866877
we do not play at political correctness in this house : we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the council over a period of time , and which the european commission has also followed carefully , attentively and UNK .    3.3038953282315844
so when we talk now about the need to involve the northern cyprus community in exchanges of information , particularly with a view to the eventual accession of the republic of cyprus to the european union , we need to be aware that we are trying to find practical formulas that will enable us to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of a political solution .    3.2276906046686054
we are not trying to deceive anyone and we are in no way trying to use practical solutions to create a model UNK political recognition .    2.733040412514028
i believe that , over time , the council of the european union has clearly demonstrated that this is not how it sees this issue .    4.018585695190986
decisions have been taken by the council with a great sense of responsibility .    3.501318549929611
we believe that helsinki was very clear in this respect .    2.6949678095778533
the authorities of the republic of cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the european union have been positive .    2.7564023101828607
there is no point in second - guessing or trying to second - UNK our intentions .    2.2346869459997634
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate , which all in all i have found to be encouraging and supportive , and it has also shown that there is a great deal of support in this house for the policy of the member states and that of the commission .    3.4024049923200064
however , i would be more than pleased to UNK a few points as requested .    3.4200368494801006
i will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7 . it is quite simple : a special heading , namely , the famous heading 7 , was created in berlin , as part of the large agenda 2000 package , for the applicant countries of eastern and central europe , which are currently undergoing a process of transformation , and for these countries alone .    2.854740622449236
malta , cyprus and turkey were not provided for at this stage .    2.5838336077201083
mrs schroedter described this as a lack of coherence .    3.2708402755166595
she ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile president - in - office of the council , who is not exactly a stranger to you , how this presumed lack of coherence has come about .    2.583834615809635
i have had a little to do with this too .    3.429845074477561
i do not believe this to be the case . the reason for this decision was , rather , that we wanted to have a special instrument for the eastern and central european states which , like malta and cyprus , are involved in the accession process , but under different conditions .    3.0055030956185864
nevertheless , i have said that i understand the arguments that people have been putting forward here and the commission will endeavour to take account of these aspirations , but since this is all about agenda 2000 and the financial perspective , we will not be able to do this without amending this financial perspective .    3.7641199021815517
hitherto this has been out of the question of course .    3.9912742851611416
by way of clarification : if we transfer it across from heading 4 to heading 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget .    2.4062351276922147
if we do this , then heading 7 would be increased accordingly but heading 4 would be decreased by the same amount .    2.408283880937762
the idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone , is not workable .    2.8873267307727972
parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got , at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the UNK that we can use to UNK euro notes !    3.3881992284580402
as for the peace process in cyprus and how it is linked with the accession negotiations , i would reiterate that there has always been a direct connection between the two .    3.0871591973610655
the commission and the council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in cyprus to undertake joint projects .    2.5744020442280737
so far , as you know , this has proved unsuccessful , and i have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary .    3.3445414922145758
mrs rothe , i would put it this way : i am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind .    3.1238309409186567
i do not have confirmation of this at present , and nor do i expect it , since we have not yet held direct talks .    2.7776316749183767
these will take place at a later date .    3.1051361591170026
i have always believed that the old line - i . e . not to admit cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the turkish community on cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves , for , with this strategy , the turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait .    2.4020281299055917
there would then be no question of cyprus acceding to the union .    2.769378512258087
as matters stand , turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of cyprus being integrated into the european union , and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the greek community whilst the turkish community , whose level of prosperity is already far lower , would fall even further behind .    2.5607101865760344
therefore , it is my firm belief that , since helsinki , there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict .    3.0793559722308537
indeed that was the idea behind it .    2.8706924411560633
after only a few weeks , mrs rothe , it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this , but in any case , i have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail .    3.3655340862067162
as yet , we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed , but one thing i can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably .    3.957625271975089
finally , of course , the cyprus question has a role in the discussions with turkey .    3.1095612314458814
i met the turkish foreign minister in brussels a few weeks ago and naturally i asked if turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue .    2.390290455163754
i would just make one point : we cannot be 100 % sure - i am not at any rate - that one only has to press a UNK in ankara to set the wheels in motion in cyprus .    2.490710127872333
it is very far from being that simple , rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts , during talks with both communities , to encourage them to reach an understanding .    2.4934842851089893
that is what we intend to do : the necessary measures and programmes are in place .    2.8759519457016225
i must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation , the one that has yet to be decided on here , before we can even get started .    3.2801526664124054
the financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with malta and cyprus .    3.3437598232310592
i cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place , because i lack the legal basis for doing so .    2.9968287716913045
this legal framework is UNK out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the commission and the council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management .    2.957533336804823
on the contrary , i would say that , although many areas of european policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence , in this instance i would claim , on behalf of the commission and the council , that we have developed a very clear , transparent and coherent policy .    3.5906306899158
. ( de ) mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , now that the commissioner has explained to us , in an extremely coherent manner , that the erstwhile president - in - office of the council and his minister of state for europe UNK responsibility for the lack of coherence , perhaps you could help the commissioner and ourselves , so as to enable us to take this decision .    3.041838218301689
it would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the financial perspective up until 2004 and on heading b7 , or if you could at least confirm that the portuguese council presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence , which is something the commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the commission .    2.6877685257804145
. ( pt ) mr president , i am sure that the issue raised by my friend elmar brok will be considered by the council .    2.7636717549528025
i believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent , regardless of who was involved in that work .    2.4505603118160524
mr president - in - office of the council , as i understood it , mr brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still .    2.304122537345065
mr president , i asked commissioner verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument meda but he has not provided an answer .    2.2934465056256372
i would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us .    3.0187776144359764
forgive me mr poos .    2.79168861055645
there was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me .    2.6452095875677912
this is how matters stand with regard to meda : malta and cyprus can take part in the national programmes , but not in the country - specific ones , because the incomes are too high .    3.2819310458623825
thank you very much commissioner verheugen .    2.3104609785624097
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
question time ( council )    2.522032895734509
question no 1 by ( h - 0022 / 00 ) :    2.2933254575741224
subject : controlling access to community waters for oil tankers in connection with the accident involving the oil tanker erika off the french coast , which produced a large oil slick , what steps does the council intend to take to control access to community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet community safety standards ?    2.1956643516134324
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , on 24 january the council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker erika .    2.099075151504835
at that time , bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident , the council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it .    2.536943065375391
the council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field .    3.575987305615966
it emphasised the importance of the council taking new measures within a community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations .    3.489584571787525
as you know , as currently framed , community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels , including those flying flags of convenience , and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards .    2.3694031965761972
there is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject .    2.710183874244441
with regard to the future , the council noted that work within the commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls , together with provisions on the qualifications of UNK agencies .    3.1315357206796133
there are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting community ports .    2.4515550604396403
these dossiers will be progressed by the transport council and i can therefore assure you , on behalf of the council , that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals , which there is every indication the commission is due to present in this area , which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection .    3.641086611963386
this house will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals , given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure .    3.044656890825636
i am pleased that the council is considering this question .    3.147998400246442
the president of the council comes from a country , portugal , which is directly at risk from just this type of situation .    3.341279940554065
if we stretched our UNK , we could envisage a situation where , between now and next summer , an oil tanker may run UNK under similar circumstances off the UNK , wreck the portuguese summer tourist industry , with a bit of luck the sea UNK would carry the pollution towards the island of madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore , wreck tourism in the canary islands as well .    2.277189971606988
does the president of the council not think that we should stop talking and implement tough measures in this area , bearing in mind that we now have the means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas ?    3.5391614840174426
of course , the story of the erika seems UNK .    2.906746535948508
a french - owned ship , under a maltese flag of convenience , an indian crew , a sea - worthiness certificate issued by italy , in sicily , with the last inspection carried out in bulgaria , i think .    2.344627539121768
the ship was sinking and the UNK realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port .    3.698224427949871
this kind of situation should not be allowed .    3.47833935928498
the damage to your country , mr president , and to mine , spain , could be horrendous .    3.829744403153585
mr medina ortega , i naturally share your concerns and i can assure you that a coastal country like my own , the country currently holding the presidency , is naturally very concerned about this issue , all the more so as it does not have any oil tankers of its own .    3.0564989265078144
however , we have to work within the existing legislative framework .    3.0603315155015776
in this area we have to work with the world as it is , and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation .    4.01299987388039
in view of the seriousness of such situations , we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field .    2.609709773088793
the commission ' s intentions in this area are positive , as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive .    3.5338338899154413
the council is minded to give priority to this area , within the transport council , and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible .    3.300646605823646
we also hope that the european parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal UNK when it comes before this house under the codecision procedure .    3.449276548880194
mr president , in UNK , in finland , there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals , which is sailing under a flag of convenience .    3.231068896031184
the vessel is anchored outside the port , as the condition it is in is a safety UNK for the port and the surrounding areas , and because it cannot be inspected properly , as there is no one who will pay .    2.8714864563865503
- ( pt ) mrs UNK , as you will understand , i do not at the moment have the information i need to give you a concrete reply .    3.6370609893392096
the information that i have is to do with the 1995 directive , which does not include any provisions of that kind .    3.3808832475050012
however , the council will certainly let you have a concrete reply on the options available for acting in the case you have mentioned .    2.7803221134113705
question no 2 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.1470195021815126
subject : high infant mortality levels in kosovo according to the most recent un information forwarded to the world health organisation , kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in europe . about 50 % of premature babies do not survive and the war has resulted in a massive increase in the number of miscarriages .    2.333862382963153
even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped .    2.2134940661645057
in view of the humanitarian aid being given by the european union and the efforts being made by the head of the interim administration , mr bernard kouchner , what measures will the council take to defend the rights of the women of kosovo to motherhood and to protect the health of pregnant women , women in UNK and new - born children ?    2.714193113254774
mr president , mrs karamanou ' s question is an extremely serious one , and i would not wish to conceal that fact .    3.2039121171024956
we are perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in kosovo and of the problem of displaced people in that region - and i mean people who originate from kosovo - and of the particular effect of this on child health and on mortality rates .    3.102322209819468
i think it is well known that the european union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community .    3.402480383646755
as you know , the european community has contributed a total of eur 378 million for the province of kosovo alone , and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by member states at national level .    3.1896471406032383
this contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification .    2.406586144259497
furthermore , as you know , the european union makes a contribution to the united nations high commission for refugees , which came to eur 66 . 3 million in 1999 .    3.113106567742139
i think that mrs karamanou is aware that , because of the need for division of labour between the international donors , the task of restoring health care in kosovo has been entrusted to the world health organisation .    2.7813832477050795
the reports produced by the who indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation , and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in UNK and general hospitals .    2.917831507968849
nevertheless , we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care , apart from child health .    3.1473125265108153
this is not just a technical situation , it is a political situation , and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation , because there are aspects to this , and we may as well be open about this , which are associated with the international community ' s inability up to now to make a multi - ethnic society function in kosovo , with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region .    3.5375441649432156
mr president - in - office of the council , i thank you for your answer which supplements what commissioner patten said yesterday on the subject .    2.3115662643335546
yet , the sum of eur 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999 , was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even UNK civilised conditions in kosovo , especially where the provision of health services is concerned .    2.3611213168248972
mr president - in - office , do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an UNK for the continent of europe , a shameful thing , which should motivate us all , so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous ?    2.8961095018270466
of course , the situation was not UNK , even before the bombardments , anything but , i should say . however , since nato ' s intervention , there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment .    3.1363998686813357
so , mr president - in - office of the council , is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long - suffering inhabitants of kosovo , and above all , keep our promises to them ?    2.8989295739922727
mrs karamanou , i recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in kosovo in this field have not been enough .    4.389386405305234
i do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that .    2.3495158437386126
i do not want to link this question with your comments about the period " before " and " after " nato ' s intervention , as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this question time .    2.248615764019273
nevertheless , i would like to say that the european union is aware that the resources it has devoted to kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within .    2.9490916060414616
we have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community .    2.7898656556221195
the european union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role , but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were , as you have said yourself , mrs karamanou , not the best before the military action in kosovo .    2.7372234071538264
what is more , i do not believe , mrs karamanou , that the military action in kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation .    3.182058721649621
the present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations , and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in kosovo ' s administration .    2.895324788743178
this is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole .    2.6506853798948478
and if we cannot solve the political problem , which must be done in accordance with the relevant united nations resolution , then we will not solve the problem of child health , nor the various other problems faced by this region .    3.0917149605608443
i would like to widen the debate and include the situation in mitrovica .    3.013949495057793
in cooperation with europe , the international community UNK the hospital there too , but it is located in the northern part of the city , thus prohibiting access to albanian kosovars .    3.0361203894703843
this means that medical aid is still denied to the albanian kosovars .    2.2153748027462883
this is also happening elsewhere in the country , causing tension between the albanian kosovars and serbs , making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where albanians do not want to be looked after by serbs and vice versa .    2.231883945728786
i understand very well what you are saying and you are right : the european union should work in a wider context of international cooperation .    2.94362774669087
but where will you place the emphasis ?    2.5267206835194136
what will you do to ensure that albanian kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital , including that in mitrovica ?    2.485817726820306
mr staes , the situation in mitrovica is well known .    3.0940584465305347
this is a very special situation with a degree of inter - ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of kosovo .    1.9985224806540247
i perfectly understand mr staes ' s concerns .    2.2488417986456253
nevertheless , i would like to say that bernard kouchner ' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant united nations resolution , in an attempt to create multi - ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities , including the various aspects of the administration .    3.1457497960966414
i believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible , because there are various protagonists involved .    2.5702676307896057
the situation in mitrovica is appalling , and involves very special tensions , and i believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed .    2.958773159379498
nevertheless , i have to say that , regrettably , we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the member states ' contributions - to guarantee the follow - up action we proposed to the military action , that is to say the establishment of inter - ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities , and , in particular , access to hospitals .    3.099468223511849
question no 3 by ( h - 0027 / 00 ) :    2.401340937494409
subject : indictment of nato before war crimes tribunal human rights organisations , such as the us human rights watch , have already collected significant evidence of nato crimes in connection with the bombing of kosovo and serbia with a view to bringing a case before the war crimes tribunal in the hague .    2.222371474380998
on the basis of this evidence , some of which has already been lodged with the tribunal , nato is accused of ' serious violations of international humanitarian law ' and ' UNK murder ' .    2.3929743201281264
does the council consider that such accusations should be put before the war crimes tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation ?    2.3352936315248396
in the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against nato , what will be done in respect of the high representative for the cfsp , who was nato secretary - general during the crisis ?    2.896948111122913
is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed ?    2.1456153998955245
mr president , mr alavanos ' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues .    2.317272710234523
the council has already , on various occasions , stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by nato were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the united nations security council resolutions .    2.213502830035231
i am aware that there may be different views about nato ' s action and the legitimacy of that action .    2.6813546384572895
everyone is free to hold such views .    2.404458711361849
in my own country , the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter .    2.503424701055388
that was how it was .    2.7202682595282366
in any case , the council ' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the north atlantic treaty organisation in the federal republic of yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in kosovo caused by the belgrade regime .    2.7712358243287425
this objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the general affairs council in luxembourg on 8 april .    2.7075015395048827
i must say that these nato measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all UNK for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the kosovo albanians from their land .    2.105546717121251
i am sure you are aware , mr alavanos , that , during her recent visit to nato headquarters , prosecutor del ponte stressed that the international tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it , including those made against nato , in particular by pacifist groups from canada .    2.402337667656213
this compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted .    3.1129137477498885
in any case , i have with me a statement made by prosecutor del ponte according to which nato is not at present under any investigation by the office of the prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning nato ' s actions in the kosovo conflict .    2.6998283955315943
all information received during the past six months , either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of nato ' s actions during the kosovo conflict , have been recorded by the prosecutor .    2.274619898997216
any other information will of course be analysed by the prosecutor , who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action .    2.5704558783031874
until that time prosecutor del ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of UNK made against nato .    2.3177060611613967
i thank the president - in - office but i do not agree with him that the purpose of nato ' s intervention was to stop a humanitarian disaster , because we have a humanitarian disaster in kosovo today , we have the hell of milosevic , followed by the hell of the kla and the nato forces .    2.780912759321678
if the president - in - office has noticed , almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to kosovo .    2.3081525325418606
despite this , he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the war crimes tribunal against nato after applications by canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question .    2.0697936226629197
my question , which the president - in - office did not answer , is this : if this inquisition procedure begins , in which the main or , if you will , one of the main people UNK and probably found guilty will be mr solana , who is today the high representative of the european union ' s common foreign and security policy , should it not be , if that happens , if the general prosecutor of the tribunal is determined to begin the process , that mr solana ' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean ?    2.7940249415015037
mr alavanos , if an action of this kind should be brought against nato and if this action were to be brought against mr javier solana personally , we would have to bear in mind that mr javier solana held one post at that time and is holding a different one today .    2.6950270683121156
the duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as secretary - general of nato .    2.2164220417926277
in the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal UNK against mr javier solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the european union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter .    2.3607223038921465
mr president , i believe mr alavanos is getting nato and mr milosevic mixed up .    2.183935151536671
mr milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding nato the UNK prize .    2.4450983694176145
but i have a quite different question for the council .    3.4051010567833346
how do matters stand in kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration , the judiciary and , most importantly of all , the police force ?    3.11089584250917
you mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done .    2.815703407093601
rapid action is called for !    2.793771206872616
with regard to the judicial structure in kosovo , we have already heard mr kouchner , on various occasions , describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure .    2.6286525472799585
as you know , the first steps were taken some months ago .    2.646861988787982
we are all aware of the difficulties , and particularly the financial difficulties , that mr kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery , and , in particular , we are aware of the special difficulty involved in UNK police so as to ensure day - to - day public safety .    2.805564553890067
statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various member states who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments .    2.3877270310276844
some member states are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces , to which they committed themselves , as quickly as they would like .    3.183063484114974
we are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising mr kouchner ' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in kosovo , especially as regards judicial structures and police cover .    2.497105410776163
this is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter - ethnic coordination , and we are all conscious that , if measures are not taken in the short term , we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago , and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of kosovo .    2.912142735873442
this is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a nato context , but , as the european union shares nato ' s view of these issues , it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this . i would like to make this clear on behalf of the council , so that there can be no doubt .    4.035440355391059
mr marset campos , you will be aware , first of all , of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation , particularly an air - based one , and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that , whilst they are not military targets as such , are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine .    2.687974892589064
we are of course entering a grey area here , and you may say , mr marset campos , that these are civilian targets , such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure , whilst others will tell me that they are military targets , because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by mr milosevic ' s forces in kosovo .    2.4682580862575647
so we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets .    2.7974146466877636
unfortunately , and as everyone recognised during the military action in kosovo , there were civilian sectors , and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public , and even inhabited areas , which were directly affected by nato air attacks .    2.740002848201286
and , above all , it was a necessary war , and it was not only about what was possible , it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community .    3.044797747129268
mr marset campos , regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight , if you take no action yourself - i believe that , if we look at what happened in bosnia and herzegovina , and at the impunity that the situation in bosnia and herzegovina led to , and the continuation of that impunity , then we might perhaps see the nato military action in kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light .    2.847766337880325
question no 4 by ( h - 0028 / 00 ) :    2.490140146373463
subject : turkish blockade of armenia given that the european union is actively promoting social , economic and political relations with armenia through the partnership and cooperation agreement , signed on 12 october 1999 , what steps is the council taking to persuade the turkish government to lift the economic blockade of armenia ?    2.138228887045182
mr president , i would like to thank the representative of the council presidency for his answer .    2.8476514482195205
nevertheless , i am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when , ultimately , there is in fact a major tripartite relationship .    3.1995046560303346
we provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place , in order to help armenia , and still the aid cannot come into play because turkey has imposed an economic blockade , and so many things cannot get through to the armenians at all .    2.447659347497986
we are negotiating with turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours .    3.1470007439333267
can you not exert greater influence over turkey , so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region , and so as to enable armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front ?    3.0353392104825683
- ( pt ) mrs schleicher , you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and , particularly , that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem .    3.5710925790351764
we feel that precisely because turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the european union , and also because turkey now has to respond to the european union ' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues , we will , to be frank , be testing turkey ' s will as regards the european union ' s priorities in its foreign relations .    3.24627224312791
our relationship with armenia , as UNK by the agreement we signed with that country last year , is of course one element in these foreign relations .    2.818141128760371
we also feel that , if turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the european union and the general framework of the european union ' s relations , regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country , it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the european union in its foreign relations .    3.0451581249658473
we are , moreover , convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the european union and turkey in the near future .    3.283461476466366
question no 6 by ( h - 0122 / 00 ) :    2.2921509006410137
subject : ethnic cleansing of serbs in kosovo since the end of the bombing of yugoslavia by nato and the eu aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of kosovar albanians by serbia , and since the arrival of kfor on 12 june 1999 , 200 000 serbs living in kosovo have been expelled and UNK murdered , UNK ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the serbs themselves .    2.084206099630244
during the last few days we have seen serbs murdered by kosovar albanian mafia - type groups , also with impunity .    2.5809028288893825
what decision will the council adopt to put an end , once and for all , to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of kosovo , irrespective of race or UNK ?    3.175844427175603
i thank the minister for his response , but i would also like to point out that , UNK , there is now more violence in kosovo than there was before the nato bombing .    3.338753411021323
it is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation , and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of nato and the european union to take such action .    3.29269762108514
i agree with what the minister very rightly said about the UNK of belgrade , but we should also remember that the secret services of the usa , germany , france , italy and the united kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the kla , a mafia , which has contributed to the problems in the area .    3.0878464863908537
we are therefore all to blame .    2.594660029728493
i would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context .    2.4037080405244073
do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on serbia in order to UNK the area economically and also to benefit kosovo as a province of serbia ?    3.1709452457906417
mr president , i am no friend of milosevic or his government .    2.148121602836367
nevertheless i have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of nato ' s action against yugoslavia over kosovo , both in terms of the lack of authority from the un security council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on serbia ' s sovereignty at UNK .    2.6339303485504053
the current situation in kosovo , which is now ethnically UNK of serbs and roma , speaks for itself .    3.197403961913316
mr UNK , with regard to the position adopted by the european union , we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives , and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were UNK up mr milosevic ' s political system and acting as propaganda for him .    2.908760622138462
i cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by nato , but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree .    2.670198706229756
some of these actions might have been questionable , and some were regarded as unfortunate by nato itself , but others were justified for tactical reasons , with the aim of preventing mr milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former yugoslavia .    2.249908527105972
in any event , i , on behalf of the council , do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by nato .    3.1848887800114793
mr president - in - office of the council , since i know the history of the balkans , i should like to remind you that , for many decades , the peoples of yugoslavia lived in peace .    2.767481469436446
destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break - up of yugoslavia , in which the european union played a decisive part .    3.0300618357457725
yugoslavia ' s crime was that it was the only balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of nato or of the european union .    2.796467483108252
so whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly UNK kla , under the very nose of kfor , whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent .    2.0257620597468793
every day , new crimes come to light against non - albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of kosovo , and there are hundreds of violations of the un ' s resolution 1244 .    2.7488714193547907
in my opinion , the best thing the council could do would be to cease occupying that part of yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides , with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non - intervention in the internal affairs of another , independent country .    2.7694552567598154
i respect your understanding and knowledge of the balkan region , mr alyssandrakis , but i find it difficult , quite frankly , to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can , in terms of political stability , be a solution to the problem .    2.9452137341773326
if we look at the democratic stability of the region , it could perhaps be said that it was the break - up of yugoslavia that caused the current situation , but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development .    3.070719446444493
nevertheless , i would like to say that yugoslavia was what it was , in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people ' s ethnic differences to a degree . it must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative .    2.8904498800604004
the division of yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept , regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way .    3.26189426590331
we do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution . quite the contrary , it would be a solution leading to calamity .    2.600435026342597
mr president , i was a little disappointed with the answer given by the president - in - office to my colleague .    2.924913184187248
it is very important , if we stress that europe is to be a europe of values , that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends .    3.7417363168001825
it should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the milosevic regime .    2.3573826040665335
that , however , is not my question .    3.996414818855316
my question is about political prisoners held in serbia now .    2.5074967207359165
there are , i believe , around 5 000 kosovar political prisoners held in serbia at the moment .    2.644247573423268
my question to the president - in - office is twofold .    2.8018561065179384
firstly , is the council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners ?    3.277775121787212
secondly , what does it propose to do about them ?    2.6112120046442415
mr maccormick , first of all , i would like to answer your comments .    2.9668391766079383
what i said and what i explained in a previous answer is that there are civilian targets linked with structures which are objects for military action , and you know as well as i do that some military actions not only go for military targets , but also for civilian targets and structures which are connected with military action .    2.6574131574916433
what is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area .    2.6026658030078216
as i said , we are not making value judgements about specific actions .    2.998199856666709
we are making an overall value judgement about nato ' s action , and this overall value judgement is positive . we agree with the general view of nato ' s action .    2.988909569583982
with regard to political prisoners in serbia , mr maccormick , it is obvious that , when i say that in serbia today mr milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level , i am referring specifically , not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens . i am also referring to the way mr milosevic UNK political prisoners , and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition ' s rights of access to the media , and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non - governmental organisations , particularly those protecting human rights .    3.0770607007958937
in spite of everything , all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by mr milosevic on UNK society , and the european union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation .    2.7103719372888166
this is precisely why the european union is maintaining all its sanctions until yugoslavia ' s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend .    2.862096328838196
question no 7 by ( h - 0035 / 00 ) :    2.401370292440255
subject : drafting of the charter of fundamental rights the general public welcomes the fact that a charter of fundamental rights is to be drawn up . it is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of europe in the 21st century .    2.829489090963937
what are the council ' s views on the substance of the charter ? what type of rights will the charter set out ( economic , social and cultural ) ?    2.150381880169156
which citizens will it cover ( those of the european union or the citizens of all european countries with a view to enlargement ? will it cover immigrants etc . ? ) ?    2.3980475259044525
will it set out established social rights in the european union or will it set a broader agenda ?    2.4892713815905734
what means will the charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes ?    2.257762060143202
what are the council ' s views on incorporating the charter into the treaty on european union ?    2.4339010646273476
i thank the president - in - office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work .    2.4709500738167818
you will understand , mr president - in - office , that there was a point to my question , because the council is a political body of the european union and the citizens of europe , men and women , want to know how it views the democratic and social model of europe in the twenty - first century .    3.2958859988088633
as a supplementary question , i should like to ask you whether , as the portuguese presidency , you have made provision for the rights of children , as such , to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the charter .    3.681315520429586
as i said , mrs kratsa - tsagaropoulou , we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the charter of fundamental rights .    2.7062423178713892
this procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group , and the matter will only be submitted to the council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter .    3.546841927029205
i would nevertheless like to say , with regard to the rights of the child , that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue , particularly for the council of europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up .    3.6248620541910594
this matter should form part of the charter of fundamental rights .    2.8430497541486957
this will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the charter of fundamental rights .    2.251777567179218
furthermore , we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue .    3.7831634595628856
i do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not .    2.322217748406092
i would remind members that , according to the guidelines for these sittings , questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer .    2.6070511624748813
you know that there is a parliamentary delegation chaired by mr UNK de UNK and a committee on constitutional affairs where these issues can be debated at great length .    2.7450201828431497
i therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief .    2.4922202661250066
otherwise , we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the charter of fundamental rights .    3.388360221460859
i am sure that the president - in - office of the council is prepared to answer everything , but i must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers .    2.888813534129367
mr rübig has the floor .    3.03465753034192
mr president , fourteen member states have imposed bilateral sanctions on another member state , because a democratically elected government was formed there .    2.471545948675273
both parties were once part of the government .    3.4690652523595635
so far there have been no infringements of the law .    2.9028848819686366
are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the charter of human rights ?    3.0168969487528123
would a right of veto on the part of the president - in - office of the council , in respect of the formation of national governments , be reconcilable with the charter of fundamental rights ?    2.6938323516577225
is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the charter of fundamental rights ?    2.3709893212435458
mr rübig , as president - in - office , i cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the portuguese prime minister on behalf of the fourteen heads of state and government of the member states of the european union was adopted UNK and not by him in his capacity as president - in - office of the council of the european union .    2.8162826732589403
nevertheless , i would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these member states was actually a set of actions of what i would call preventive political action at diplomatic level . we feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which , although it has become part of a european union government , does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the union ' s aims .    2.7632995978007036
i do not wish to UNK on this subject on behalf of the council presidency , because my government intervened at the request of , and in conjunction with , fourteen member states and not in its presidency capacity .    3.1850865708501632
mr president , i have the honour of being a member of the convention drafting the charter so i am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force .    2.661247033106835
what i would like to know is what will happen to the draft charter that the convention draws up ?    2.8134648490340752
will the council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands , or will the council feel free to amend that document ?    2.9483917864805544
will the council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then UNK that draft charter ?    2.4308830698838557
- ( pt ) the answer is neither yes nor no .    2.371098778063093
i do not know , mr martin . it will depend on the decision taken by the council .    2.652749287003424
question no 8 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.005726992803683
subject : granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the ilisu dam in turkey the UNK meeting in cologne called on the oecd to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits .    2.3410069687775628
these can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects .    2.768437526993458
will the eu take the lead in UNK this process ?    2.4541565755060173
the need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the british government that it is ' minded to grant ' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the ilisu dam in turkey .    2.434980034634518
the world bank has decided not to fund the project , which will UNK 20 000 UNK , potentially limit the fresh water supply to syria and iraq and cause ecological damage .    2.3881059857806526
the process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as UNK but clearly the fact that the british government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far .    2.489782559923972
i wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by eu companies in the eu applicant countries .    2.4866021174036
i ask this because of the issue of coherence , the subject of this morning ' s discussion .    3.6498071162344474
on the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet , at the very same time , the eu member states are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging .    2.8841076111520194
can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring ?    2.591727746178161
- ( pt ) mrs lucas , i was not present at the debate you are referring to .    2.42064229530392
i would like to say that the council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing , at a later date .    3.2102806377798756
question no 9 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.013578608550366
the affected area is designated a special protection area ( spa ) under the wild birds directive and is under consideration for a special area of conservation under the habitats directive , as it is an area of international importance . many local and european associations have strongly criticised the project .    1.9440064120216742
similar cases occur in other regions of the union , where eu development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures .    2.383283439655809
is not the council of the opinion that the court of auditors should be given more resources in order to investigate or review similar development measures where environmental conflicts arise ?    3.250499529732887
what kind of measures does the council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the european institutions in similar cases ?    3.066792025543479
. ( pt ) in response to your question , mrs mckenna , i would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the court of auditors was laid down in the treaty establishing the european community .    3.2658456407010643
in accordance with article UNK of the treaty , the auditing of accounts is carried out by the court of auditors which , to this end , studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions . the court also guarantees proper financial management .    2.731638487894302
this is indeed also stipulated in article 248 .    2.5847719410190217
the court of auditors , therefore , already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role .    3.0263842949827637
with regard to your suggestion for increasing the court ' s resources , the council considers that all of the union ' s institutions have , under the community budget , the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective UNK .    3.4491141494936612
in some cases , it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased , but there are budgetary restraints of which i am sure you are aware .    2.9813460967594487
i would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the budget of the european union is approved by common agreement between the council and this parliament .    3.090010579922594
the council therefore , has no means of changing the role conferred on the court of auditors by the treaty .    2.5346620084117424
if extra resources were given to the court of auditors it would be money well spent , because it would ensure that eu funding was not going to something that UNK with environmental concerns .    2.9917517845256554
for years the council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes .    2.492045643792225
i would ask you , now that you are president of the council , will you push forward with this extremely important proposal .    3.1294701857170875
i would like to know what you could do about this as president - in - office of the council at the moment because it is the council that has been blocking this for a long time .    3.04805521798545
it is extremely important .    2.531882693407651
if the court of auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development , it would be very important because the court of auditors could do an extremely good job .    2.660325879927529
their reports are extremely detailed and very important .    2.6200912311374176
this is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future .    3.227384520547098
it is therefore the commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions .    2.4853561128627297
the commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions .    2.846467275770368
i do not think that i can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted .    2.57408373895545
question no 10 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.1465879495976155
subject : statute for members of the european parliament the council and parliament are going to try to reach agreement on a statute for the members of the european parliament .    3.8640140565894816
one of the matters to be settled is whether members are to receive equal pay , and where they are to pay tax .    2.791750926706261
according to media reports the portuguese presidency considers that all members should pay the same tax , to the eu . this is in conflict with the view taken by some member states who wish to have the right to tax their members in their home countries .    3.364311037974511
will the portuguese presidency clarify its position on this matter ?    3.5542925475740517
. ( pt ) the portuguese presidency is particularly interested in this issue , as i suppose that this is the first time a presidency has made resolving the problem of a statute for members of the european parliament a priority in its programme .    3.5366132284100598
the portuguese presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities , as furthermore , did the president of the european parliament , when she stated this at the helsinki european council .    2.768485367639013
we are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter .    2.3531311269244126
we are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise , and we have already begun work on this matter .    2.8968866293350133
it is worth pointing out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the council , in accordance with article 190 , and the assent of this parliament , to which it falls to approve this statute .    3.2059042166352723
the presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of members of this parliament and with the group to which parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the council .    3.0257393898337823
i myself had an opportunity to meet this group , for the first time , in parallel with the january part - session , and i am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions .    3.241534659108636
with regard more specifically to your question , i would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way .    2.716338597972858
this has , from the outset , been the position of the portuguese presidency .    3.2995870518533574
nevertheless , our role as UNK means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the council and i am sure you are aware , mr sjöstedt , that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations .    3.4575539881237476
as this is the case , whatever solution is found , i think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all member states , regardless of their national positions on the matter .    3.461932471423109
what i can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working , for as long as it is involved with this matter , in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards members of the european parliament . we will also make the utmost effort with members of the council , particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year , so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution , and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this house .    3.2522094184596173
mr president , i would thank the council of ministers for its answer . i want to ask two follow - up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians .    2.69671936002622
my basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives , in which one ' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services .    2.834114207537944
i intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do .    2.8674887835852525
is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians ?    2.3409743063113946
that is my first question .    3.102906440353901
my second question is about whether the portuguese presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue ' s being solved in different ways for members of different nationalities , or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities .    2.4289699070271658
- ( pt ) without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this house and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve , i would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately .    2.7065831301583243
we are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations .    2.4539807849053457
this sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the presidency of the council of the european union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations .    3.5430343262780353
this has an impact of course , because it is read by other members of the council .    3.619133148169849
at this stage in the discussion , please forgive me if i cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me . i would ask that we be judged on our results , when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future .    2.870557423631613
i will be happy to come back to parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached , or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved .    2.573862647407807
i would like to ask the president - in - office of the council , after his few hours working in this chamber with these members of the european parliament , whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay ?    2.8893172988309805
mr purvis , as this discussion of salaries in the european parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country , i have a precise idea of what the salaries of the members of the european parliament are worth .    3.25767593442192
i am therefore perfectly aware of this problem .    2.921255557452899
mr president , i want to thank you for your answer . i want to ask a follow - up question which bears some resemblance to the one mr sjöstedt asked .    2.397112009761018
we both come from sweden . in our country , we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local .    2.3904541330378
we have extensive services , too . we have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and , not least , in european politicians here in parliament .    2.6097470161675043
how do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education , health care etc - but , at the same time , did not pay any tax and did not contribute ?    2.2667711602504426
how do you think a system like that would affect people ' s confidence in ourselves as politicians ?    2.4653615295789937
mr president - in - office of the council , i do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question .    2.56923963773314
however , if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy , go ahead !    2.505993936008814
. mr president , i have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy .    2.8573449756488207
these are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the statute for members and of its role in the context of political society .    2.7318362494876225
i do not want to enter into this type of discussion because i think that it might , to use a french expression , UNK the portuguese presidency ' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the statute for members .    3.4228990410705733
i would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter .    2.41881025391816
since the time allotted to questions to the council has elapsed , questions nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing .    2.2943709330142013
that concludes questions to the council .    2.623209247024021
( the sitting was suspended at 7 . 05 p . m . and resumed at 9 . 00 p . m . )    1.7599144725727314
address by mr vaclav havel , president of the czech republic    2.8789966580753585
mr president in office , ladies and gentlemen , i have great honour in extending a warm welcome , on behalf of the house , to the president of the czech republic , mr vaclav havel .    2.953632094919264
i should also like to welcome mrs havel , who is sitting in the gallery .    2.7793194453010366
you are most welcome .    2.823200714689274
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
this is not your first visit to our parliament , mr president .    2.7968261811813475
you addressed plenary in strasbourg nearly six years ago , in march 1994 , and many of us , who were already european members of parliament at that time , still have a vivid UNK of your speech .    2.82799575426686
in fact , shortly after the maastricht treaty was ratified , you spoke in favour of strengthening european values , creating a european ethical dimension and opening the union to the countries of central and eastern europe .    2.44747175276861
in other words , for many citizens , and not just in your country , you UNK the european values to which we constantly voice our attachment .    2.7393192448271257
the process of european integration and enlargement has UNK up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain .    2.3626942249862415
the end of this artificial separation of europe marked the start of a new era .    3.047540762773346
we now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of europe .    2.335517642991473
mr president , you are a symbol of these changes .    2.986077021360556
you founded and signed charter 77 , the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people .    2.131730520847914
a communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity .    2.1924148456505863
but you never lost hope and history proved you right .    2.1380011196812365
ten years ago , the " UNK revolution " proclaimed havel UNK UNK .    2.849249697072385
for ten years you represented democratic UNK and , later , the czech republic , as its president .    2.550174750238529
reconciliation with your neighbours was , and still is , a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance .    2.4175552478839872
you are a first class european .    2.8509899126275426
today , the czech republic is preparing to join our union .    2.7238914625342048
i am sure that you will agree , mr president , and experience has shown us , that the process of enlargement of the union is not without its UNK for both parties and the czech republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria .    3.646083063992894
the european union , for its part , will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement .    3.125504122594912
it has already taken a big step forward with agenda 2000 .    2.4866280714087496
the next step , i . e . institutional reform , will be taken following the inauguration of the new intergovernmental conference , in which the european parliament will be fully involved .    3.834901474023955
our responsibility as members of the european parliament is to ensure that the process of enlargement takes place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that , when the time comes , the citizens of the european union and the citizens of the czech republic will approve the accession of the czech republic to the european union through their elected representatives .    3.4683155092665894
mr president , it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor .    2.5191425245961154
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
mr president , allow me , on behalf of the european parliament , to extend our UNK thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation .    2.981548344554687
thank you . you are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a european identity .    2.5376370236747983
and you have used your personal experience to show us that your european identity was not UNK ; it was a spontaneous and natural move .    2.4405857511100355
i have taken note of your words ; this is something which we all feel very deeply .    2.8964161012736023
we find you UNK to the principles which have always guided you , which have always guided your actions ; your attachment to fundamental values .    2.639918743354689
you reminded us of your speech in 1994 , which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative , but there is such a thing as creative UNK and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come .    2.799041086733302
to summarise , perhaps what struck me most in your speech ; above all , you wished to remind us that , beyond its economic aspects , the task of constructing europe is a spiritual one .    2.3865285014508753
we of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you .    2.1619839037896296
thank you , mr president .    2.607459037554344
( the formal sitting was closed at 12 . 40 p . m . )    2.2639981823800155
acp - eu joint assembly    3.562565223800453
the next item is the annual report ( a5 - 0032 / 2000 ) by mr corrie , on behalf of the committee on development and cooperation , on the results of the activities of the UNK - eu joint assembly in 1999 .    2.9322862953430597
, rapporteur . - mr president , i had hoped to be rising at 9 a . m . , not 9 p . m . , to present this report .    2.7065486086881196
i hope the number of members in this chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work .    3.1554494756606837
however , it is normal practice that the report on the work of the acp - eu joint assembly is put before members of this parliament and i have the pleasant task of doing that tonight .    3.184169083357416
once again , i can report two highly successful assemblies having taken place , one in strasbourg and one in nassau .    2.5904174834328946
in many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one .    3.0978169298501874
the acp - eu joint assembly is a unique organisation in world politics .    2.3052863834606168
where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern ?    2.1837524722996937
the strasbourg assembly was the last chaired by lord plumb .    2.2663224169540332
in honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the joint bureau in nassau made him an honorary president , and we wish him well in his retirement .    2.2079225873230257
the two assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the lomé convention and i look forward to the signature of a new convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned .    2.766992020536562
i remember that at the last mid - term review , when i was rapporteur , the then commissioner UNK said that review would be the last .    2.967549429524328
well , he was wrong , and i pay tribute to UNK UNK and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new convention in very difficult circumstances .    2.767167031268923
i was also delighted to hear the report this morning from commissioner nielson who has worked UNK to get the right outcome to the negotiations .    2.5550532873318237
i pay special tribute to him for his success .    2.3732264237159804
i also pay tribute to mrs kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of lomé .    2.630547879917297
i am quite sure that mrs kinnock ' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations .    2.9497200193664925
we have had question times to the council and the commission and to the acp council , and i would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work .    3.3014060645005636
the main thrust of our work in both assemblies was poverty eradication .    2.533529668137888
the resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights .    2.8210756471157166
we might then see an end to some of the fraud , corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped .    2.8360075811352257
we had , as usual , many debates on countries where there are war situations .    2.4265821122708924
i visited ethiopia and eritrea to gain first - hand knowledge .    2.192783273284037
the oau is doing its best to UNK a peace deal there .    2.6540656022175493
but ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious .    2.210481983778828
we were delighted to hear in nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with south africa after four years of negotiations .    2.1603648121966423
this highlights the problems of coherence between the eu and the developing nations , which came to a head at the wto talks in seattle .    2.7787567026288618
much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free - trade agreements .    2.7988450341070337
in nassau , we had two interesting debates on east timor and cuba .    2.5458302697851676
cuba has observer status but i understand has now shown a wish to join the acp .    2.474294270685394
all nations from within the confines of the acp territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy , human rights , governance and an independent judiciary are , i am sure , welcome .    3.0887136268088944
i await with interest developments in cuba .    2.4605227106156238
when mr dalmau , the cuban UNK minister for foreign affairs addressed the assembly , he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known .    2.030172725235495
on east timor , mr da costa , from the timorese national resistance council , gave a very moving address indicating that east timor would also like to join the acp when it becomes a state with a government .    2.3960390472902593
we must give them all our support to reach that goal .    2.5031809266086973
human rights is such an important issue within the acp - eu assembly that joint vice - presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the assembly .    2.2581108805177807
i had the honour of being elected the european co - president at the beginning of this fifth term and mr UNK from UNK is the new acp co - president .    2.7687302695464533
i would like to see a number of changes to our assembly , particularly after the signing of the new convention in may .    3.1029465087600228
we must have more equality between our acp partners and our european members and i want to get rid of the " them and us " syndrome .    2.6518639269864903
firstly , i would like to see a joint parliamentary assembly of elected members from acp countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates .    2.115701819225884
this i think is the new convention .    3.434488438567849
secondly , the new convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions , which would allow us to be much more specific in our work .    2.9801482480762687
these assemblies would report back to the joint assembly .    3.4244347150561962
we had a regional debate in nassau in the caribbean and this was extremely productive .    2.675324874024258
we are going to have one in UNK in west africa too .    2.851335691356399
i want the assembly to stop being just a talk - shop and become a work - shop for the UNK of all the people in developing countries .    2.714139512117429
i want to see civil society given a UNK voice .    2.6292034241470112
but to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head - on .    3.679249808354145
we must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance .    2.652444179933566
equally , we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose UNK do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand .    2.6962345511253996
i am delighted to see the result in zimbabwe .    2.738105725781338
european taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used .    2.4457754449605913
a new wind of change must blow through africa and new standards must be set and lived up to .    2.1687699372026805
the joint assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance , human rights and democracy in cooperation with the commission .    2.935435751487352
i believe that as equal partners the eu - and acp - elected delegates are up to that task .    2.1939524361405343
i beg to move acceptance of this report .    2.7327195444609234
mr president , let me begin by congratulating mr corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report .    2.601657660732565
our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty .    3.36161809698182
but there is a UNK contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many member states and in the eu .    3.0620925710110143
with regard to financing , we must look to the future and provide the joint assembly with additional funds so that , for instance , we can send delegations to the acp states to UNK electoral processes , at their invitation .    3.1970263671095482
in future , the eu must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and , furthermore , must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively .    2.6970256707956195
an example here could be the field of education , which will deserve and need special support in the acp states in future .    3.1640611593264176
for instance , the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries , which at present still have modest resources , to move towards a global approach , as opposed to globalisation .    2.4447070695047604
i see it as a future task of the eu to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium - sized enterprises in the acp states , which can promote self - help .    3.410528219750748
an example here is the problem in nigeria , which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers .    2.252148935597024
one way forward to promote the setting up of smes could be to train the UNK population adequately .    2.359598804299193
it will be easier to take account of the developing countries ' very diverse problems , and eu aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if , as the report makes quite clear , we take the urgently needed step of UNK our working methods , by introducing the proposed regional assemblies .    2.4328350396625242
congratulations on your maiden speech : it went really well .    2.2067307365796913
mr president , it cannot be repeated often enough : since 1975 , the lomé convention has constituted an important pillar of european development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects .    2.361727370430555
based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality , and on parliamentary control by the joint assembly , it is an example to the world .    4.237054336061802
most appropriately , given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under lomé , we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement , which also UNK the joint assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides .    2.6493140950228393
so i do not want to look back only to the year 1999 .    3.51410165654062
the rapporteur , mr corrie , has already done so most UNK .    2.936941949237744
much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s .    2.754869833866791
they also had strong repercussions in the developing countries .    2.5289259424335233
the after - shocks can still be felt .    2.4373266925186927
acp cooperation is a dynamic process .    2.699873778270549
the content of the agreements has progressed steadily between lomé i and lomé vi .    2.2797615961404234
all those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to namibia and south africa .    2.4378332791959747
cuba has just knocked at the door , and , if cuba is also accepted into the acp - eu community , that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in cuba itself .    2.741894132198862
so acp cooperation remains very exciting , and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new convention .    3.6636195901500503
fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic , cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies , based on respect for human rights , in the acp states .    3.014963556096457
that also means strengthening the democratic institutions .    2.510487535222264
in the past , the representatives of the acp countries tended to be government members , government officials or ambassadors ; but today at least three quarters of the acp delegates are elected members of parliament .    2.578827297276746
we ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100 % in the near future , which is indeed what the new convention is aiming at .    2.70911766501377
unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which , unlike the various crises that arise , largely pass unnoticed .    2.1202646356485335
one special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the acp states is regional cooperation and integration .    2.893180461884469
there is one wish on the european parliament ' s long wish list that will be fulfilled : as we have already heard , the joint assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies .    3.2005514238287547
enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic , economic , social or religious factors , i . e . have a preventive effect .    2.154779733960487
for the same reason the european parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision - making processes and in cooperation management , and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation .    2.85565978209697
the enhanced contacts between the joint assembly and the social partners provided for in the new convention are another step in the right direction .    2.7183371796181794
but i am a little sad that the european development fund has still not been incorporated in the community budget .    3.405229037676511
i hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too .    2.5744883915688557
mr president , i congratulate mr corrie on his report .    2.3990976064670297
the lomé convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the eu and the acp countries for over 25 years .    3.0623341698415967
that it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters , including the wto , is a triumph of sorts .    2.760328698794381
but of course the new convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the eu commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets .    3.2228988553171836
measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements . for example , the agreement is particularly disappointing for those acp countries suffering from short - term fluctuations in export earnings .    2.776271070102032
during a UNK negotiating session in december a compromise was reached which provided that , in respect of least - developed , landlocked and island states , assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2 % loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10 % for the other acp states .    2.387695414900739
but at the final negotiating session the eu claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2 % threshold .    2.3431693185148554
this change has been devastating for the windward islands in particular which may be the only acp state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements .    2.3431442147142887
this seems a particularly perverse outcome since the windward islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the acp states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new lomé arrangement .    2.72025403424947
meanwhile , on the trade side , pressure from the wto to ensure that any lomé convention is wto - compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so - called regional economic partnership arrangements or free - trade agreements .    2.70015061986189
non - least - developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements .    2.426550484478368
yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the UNK winds of free trade without UNK their own domestic economy .    2.558028073733005
we therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free - trade arrangements .    3.0846482268593496
we need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the acp are pursued in their own right .    2.5334914188410735
finally , during any new trade round the eu and the acp states should press jointly for a reform of gatt article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non - reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically UNK groups of countries .    2.125761614309388
the lomé convention is a unique partnership ; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of lomé and involve a participation of the wto and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora .    2.681258750422356
mr president , what i want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of africa , the caribbean and the pacific .    2.9346971636496444
people have the UNK to say they benefit from the lomé convention , but even looking at trading relations alone , the lomé convention has done nothing to protect those countries ; their already UNK share in trade with europe has been UNK .    2.4713276337015997
that reflects the growth of inequality between eu and acp countries .    2.345863094540359
the lomé convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial UNK , which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence , notably on the former colonial powers .    2.1529575738427416
when it comes to so - called development aid , given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better , development is clearly not what the aid is for , even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for european manufacturers .    2.7633921173554152
the aid is primarily a UNK for incumbent regimes , and the poor majority does not benefit at all .    3.022891753013964
even if it were properly UNK this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care , education or drinking water supply .    2.8411493447272553
for some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid , and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption .    2.85032139636018
after all , who protects these deeply corrupt regimes , if not the governments of the rich countries ?    2.6917598703929175
they turn a blind eye to the UNK of corruption , the big groups controlling oil , water supply , or public works . they could UNK down on them since their head offices are here in europe .    2.3903453318585695
the debate about either extending the lomé convention with its quotas and protectionism , or , instead , gradually UNK down the special relationship between the european union and the acp countries in the name of free trade , is a UNK debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and UNK of those countries .    2.7803990167717783
i protest against an UNK and UNK organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a UNK death to enrich a minority .    2.573416245218314
a mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty , but , until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups , we are just covering up the real problems .    2.5119948304436357
mr president , i want to thank the co - president of the joint acp - eu assembly , mr corrie . it was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the acp - eu assembly .    2.7152457141622155
in this speech , i will confine myself to addressing certain points i consider fundamental .    2.4779629535190315
i believe the european parliament should call for the assembly to become truly parliamentary , urging all acp countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives , so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric .    2.4770726283094633
my next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the wto , which is seen by the acp countries as an enormous danger to their development .    3.0094041526421504
i do believe the acp countries need a transition period , but they also need support in the context of the new logic of UNK of aid , not only in agriculture and fisheries , but also in the exploitation of UNK and underground resources , some of which are being exploited , with slim economic returns to the acp countries themselves .    3.261434955280429
thirdly , the european parliament - through a joint working group within the joint assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in acp countries ' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and , above all , social development , and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the acp countries .    2.646144529316082
we must put the people of the acp countries first in our relationship with their rulers , who need to be fully aware that development aid from the european union is intended for the people and not for the UNK that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries .    3.321923549865114
fourthly , and finally , the prevention of inter - ethnic conflicts between states must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals i have set out .    2.5884348409352804
mr president , i agree with the positive evaluation mrs UNK has just made and i want to add that mr corrie has started his term as co - president of the acp - eu joint assembly with effective and UNK work deserving of our full appreciation .    2.478556674229546
i shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago , partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here .    2.6126424606601453
i refer to cuba ' s expression of intent , of 2 february , to become a full member of the acp group of countries .    2.848694026566874
a cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the acp - eu joint assembly in nassau , and vice - chancellor dalmau spoke in the plenary session , engaging in a lively debate , and afterwards held conversations with many of us .    2.3126765572044117
following nassau , a delegation from parliament led by mr corrie and the chairman of the committee on development and cooperation , UNK UNK , visited havana and a series of very UNK exchanges of opinion took place .    2.5849525659629977
it is my impression that this mission from the european parliament was the final push which convinced our cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the european union .    2.5890280481999497
we are witnessing events of great political significance and i hope that we in the european parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the union , so that cuba ' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible .    3.03180204848575
that is important , for at least three reasons .    2.7987997306308734
first , it is important for cuba , to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the united states blockade , which has been repeatedly condemned by the european parliament and the united nations .    3.438729999625371
secondly , we must bear in mind that cuba ' s application has the support of all the acp countries .    3.2915218504898385
if the european union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates , we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them .    2.8794844644458184
nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the european union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter .    3.113233487749382
by accepting cuba into the acp community we will be demonstrating that our europe is not involved in the shameful process of ' playing but not paying ' , and that , when we get indignant about UNK like the UNK - UNK act , we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences .    2.9105830990984316
the acp - eu joint assembly meets again in a few weeks time and i am sure this subject will be dealt with there .    2.894649536642866
ideally the european parliament ' s representatives should be able to support cuba ' s intent at those proceedings , as our parliamentary colleagues from the acp countries will no doubt be doing .    2.971270317072591
of course , cuba must meet all the standard conditions , just like any other member .    2.539818853027987
the cubans know that and i am sure they accept it .    3.194944519545651
it must also be made clear that cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners .    2.9078303369429643
cuba ' s wish to join is welcome and cuba will be welcome in our circle .    2.460735375772928
i say that wholeheartedly , but also with the deep conviction that , just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and , as a consequence of that , extreme tension and a UNK of the cuban position , the integration we are supporting here , and the prosperity it will produce , will translate into the UNK and openness we all seek and from which all of us , especially the cuban people , will benefit .    2.789630313866155
mr president , i also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur , mr corrie , for an excellent report which i think very well describes and UNK the work which has been done in the acp - eu joint assembly in the course of 1999 .    3.266826978337984
i do not have very long in which to speak , and i really only want to take up two questions .    3.2433998171268277
the first is about the fight against poverty , which i think is becoming an embarrassment both for the eu and the member states .    3.297920413855599
in spite of the fact that , both in the treaty and at the un ' s meetings in rio and copenhagen , there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world , the budget for development aid is , in actual fact , being cut back , when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen .    3.0029990172286047
we must put a stop to this trend .    2.5641328559753087
we must begin by writing off debts . we must follow up words with action .    2.3732965158619614
i should like us to take a leading role in this work .    3.197923862146156
my second question concerns the fact that , in many contexts , we talk about the acp countries having to learn the principles of democracy .    3.189242360527744
paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand , within the context of the new agreement , that working methods should be developed and UNK .    3.415804354436296
the acp countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion .    3.1023571834025296
i think that is a very good idea indeed , and i fully subscribe to it .    3.482877988115019
how do these operate within the european parliament ' s delegation to the acp - eu ' s joint assembly ?    3.8199927776605467
in contrast to how things are done here in the european parliament and in parliament ' s committees , where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports , there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the joint assembly . the two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves .    2.540508818542125
in order to change this undemocratic arrangement , we , the group of the greens / european free alliance , have tabled amendment no 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents , together with the members of working parties , should be appointed in accordance with clear , democratic rules .    2.6564125149428697
in this context , account ought to be taken of the smaller groups , and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements .    2.6289333078821002
mr president , commissioner , firstly , i too would like to congratulate mr corrie on the quality of his report , which appropriately reflects the UNK of the debates in the joint assembly he so effectively co - chaired .    2.8570877276505557
the eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim , to whit , preferential agreements between the european union and the acp countries within the framework of the lomé conventions .    2.5865665890679255
the challenge was immense .    2.720249599427413
globalisation , free trade , and the UNK of the wto with its UNK philosophy , were UNK the very essence of the north - south dialogue .    3.3372885215157853
so we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development , and personally i am convinced that the work of the last joint assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations , as did the new climate created by the events at seattle .    2.7998514924245783
however , while i welcome the renewal of the agreements , what i find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close .    2.5671882549000373
the european union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old UNK , or frankly neo - UNK , logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons , following a formula our friend michel rocard is so keen on .    2.2333607915894453
the union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners .    2.5776957228864537
by refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool , in the hands of technocrats , for imposing new sets of conditions , the european union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty .    3.220266506098624
we have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events .    2.0881820967069773
what right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history , values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own ?    2.1624274528525995
personally , i prefer the willingness that is clearly UNK up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities , non - governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can UNK achieve ownership cooperation .    2.428961568548269
in short , this is the only way they can emerge from UNK and UNK dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves , the proof of success .    2.8849652984941505
mr president , commissioner , firstly , i too would like to congratulate mr corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report .    2.3337077068392618
the european parliament ' s opinion on the activities of the acp - european union joint assembly has always had a major impact , undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the european union in development and cooperation .    2.952218951786267
the important role of the increasingly parliamentary joint assembly in strengthening relations between the european union and the acp countries needs to be stressed .    3.3496118139267947
in view of this positive action , there is every advantage to be gained from according the joint assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work .    2.6813023578677537
we back the rapporteur ' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies , under the aegis of the joint assembly , in the six regions of the convention : the caribbean , the pacific and four african regions .    2.940966901594026
these regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas .    2.5059409211517147
poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the joint assembly and its eradication is the priority for the european union ' s development policy .    2.9971983836533918
in line with the resolution at the nassau meeting , we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community .    2.7400041477122405
consistency and action are needed .    2.78191986708333
the next lomé convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies .    2.3324061163747287
the participation of local bodies is absolutely essential .    2.8460642492584265
people in the poor countries are beginning to despair .    3.2143729027599797
i call on the commission to act on the rapid accession of east timor to the lomé convention as one means , amongst others , of promoting the eradication of poverty and UNK its economic , cultural and social development , in order to strengthen its internal democratisation .    2.7817417218565894
finally , i must congratulate the council presidency on the coming europe - africa summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace , democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of africa .    2.7509356861204095
i am also delighted to be able to confirm that i shall be participating in the joint assembly ' s next meeting , which takes place in march in nigeria .    3.0333444165075716
the commission is pleased to see the joint assembly playing a larger role , especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development .    2.9717929508320764
the commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role .    2.5881811759287032
in order to be able to develop , the countries concerned must , however , become actively involved in the global economic system .    3.284397662402478
with regard to trade with our partners in development , the commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the acp countries ' special economic and social limitations .    3.427059502591843
mrs lucas mentioned that the UNK and UNK system ought to be continued with .    3.7427553471689547
i do not agree .    2.7253562508000058
it operates too slowly , and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future , because this will operate more flexibly .    3.235868662775916
regarding the future accession of countries such as east timor to the lomé convention , i can only repeat what i recently said to the european parliament ' s committee on development and cooperation , namely , that the door is open .    3.1226366608651097
it is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door .    2.4688294983004164
once they have done so , we shall adopt a position on the matter .    3.67536434741852
with regard to cuba ' s application for accession to the lomé convention , the commission notes that , according to their recent declaration , the acp states support cuba ' s application .    2.8717828626270934
the eu has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards cuba , as outlined in the eu ' s common position , but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex .    3.127760805561865
with regard to the UNK d ' UNK , i can inform you that the whole of the eur 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities .    3.417796953104132
for its part , the commission supports this , but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the UNK and UNK .    3.7121584449090674
concerning article UNK , i can say that , during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement , a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed .    3.330232292071142
it is now the case , following adoption of the amsterdam treaty , that parliament wishes , on the basis of article 300 , to be kept fully informed of all decisions , and the commission will continue to take account of parliament ' s decisions on this subject .    3.797861011466658
there are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in parliament in connection with such decisions .    2.603393748667538
this would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted amsterdam treaty .    2.4706902338528667
finally , i would refer to the south africa agreement , which the rapporteur also touched upon .    3.411046588974432
in this regard , i am simply pleased - delighted , in fact - here this evening , as a conclusion to this debate , to be able , very appropriately , to inform you that south africa ' s president has today said yes to the solution which the eu ' s council of foreign ministers last monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding south africa .    2.8008249412574635
so the " UNK war " is over .    2.648900352620135
peace has broken out , and we can now look forward to cooperation with south africa in accordance with the common UNK and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start .    2.9906493394610414
i think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has , on the whole , been quite positive , and i would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the third world on precisely the work in question .    3.06124042346182
thank you , commissioner .    2.120450226877885
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.6677986406930794
stabilisation and association agreement with fyrom    3.3299029516803462
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0031 / 2000 ) by mr swoboda , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the recommendation for a council decision authorising the commission to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with fyrom ( sec ( 1999 ) 1279 - c5 - 0166 / 1999 - 1999 / 2121 ( cos ) .    2.155930564161025
mr president , commissioner patten , today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times , a country that is , however , moving in a very promising direction , thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community .    3.0194689076729575
so if the european union , the council and the commission are proposing - and i assume that parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south - eastern europe , in the balkan region - i am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that fyrom itself has worked its way into a good position , in economic and , of course , mainly in political terms , in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority .    3.178271466496441
that country and its politicians - no doubt with some differences here and there - have always done very good work , and we should recognise that .    2.5722578869538926
the commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the council .    3.007710485452199
let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat , although , even in this regard , i want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge commissioner patten ' s activities and interest in relation to fyrom and the region as a whole .    2.6213173751911327
firstly , there is the regional approach .    3.197104681335241
i believe that if it is understood properly , the regional approach is both important and necessary .    2.5744809645982514
provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate , as an opportunity that each country should grasp , then this is the right approach .    3.2835250776930915
the problem is that , when we look at fyrom , we can see how very difficult it is to cooperate economically with some neighbouring countries , such as kosovo and albania , or to cooperate politically with , for instance , yugoslavia .    2.893418885165722
on the other hand , cooperation with bulgaria , and in particular with greece , has made good progress and i think we should acknowledge that too .    2.612617366770351
in this context , the european union must consider , as it began to do early this week , how to include the neighbouring yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything , i . e . without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime .    2.706892174058638
tomorrow morning i will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while UNK them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation .    2.5095976619716356
in that regard allow me to say , since i come from a country through which the danube flows , that i am grateful that the commission , i . e . commissioner patten and also vice - president palacio , with whom i was recently in budapest , is considering opening the danube to shipping again . that would provide for a UNK of economic recovery in this region too , which , of course , would be of particular importance to romania .    3.036586668177074
in my view , this regional approach , provided it is understood correctly , i . e . as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself , is in fact the right one to adopt .    2.7777420498887166
as i said , it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition .    2.552933006702885
secondly , let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer fyrom accession to the european union .    2.865084580854319
in our view , it would be an illusion to think there was any point in fyrom applying for accession right now , but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date .    2.605370966676208
fyrom wants to be told here and now that , in principle , accession will be possible when the time is right .    3.2590152370479464
this country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined .    3.617206405425881
it sees , in the whole UNK of aid instruments , a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards europe but that this train will continue through europe while leaving fyrom on a UNK .    2.7458915736492173
i think commissioner patten understands that too .    2.3342419856603933
thirdly , i believe that , so far at least , fyrom has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly .    3.3702227022535087
even though there will of course be UNK here , fyrom will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in brussels today can in future be handled in skopje , in the country itself .    2.962853548074279
i hope that the honourable members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards fyrom .    2.7935054789775253
mr president , since the start of the yugoslav wars , the republic of macedonia - i prefer to use this UNK - has behaved as a constructive peace - keeper .    2.3675520082894685
we would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of macedonia and bosnia and herzegovina at the time , which had non - violent liberalisation and a non - violent separation from the yugoslav federal structure in view .    2.7434706298117844
as you can see , our macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that macedonia is not just a UNK in our so - called strive towards stability , but actually took the initiative .    2.926241164779765
the former president , mr UNK , can take special credit for this , and the current president too has already adopted the profile of president of all macedonian citizens , so much so that the european union should only be grateful to have him as UNK in the balkans .    3.1868320970999817
despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension , both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good .    2.0486223671254953
it was , in fact , in macedonia that i heard at the time about the roma population actually not having too bad a time there .    2.4117194352686973
i was UNK to hearing this type of comment about the roma in europe .    2.6260943369806657
with regard to the problems afflicting macedonia , higher education for the albanian - speaking citizens deserves our special attention .    2.2347033210132103
i might never have studied otherwise .    2.493839943883478
the agreement with macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against serbia , which is at no cost to us but costs serbia ' s neighbouring states all the more .    2.430243811897517
it would be beneficial if we could UNK this , especially vis - à - vis the neighbouring states .    2.305536504706947
it is only fair that we should regulate aid to macedonia properly now .    2.6175700360758944
we are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals ' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states ' interests , for we need to give industry in macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction .    2.4372791384324044
i am more than happy to include bulgaria and romania in this , as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former yugoslavia , plus albania .    2.501873162082239
it is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again , which can quite easily be done with the aid money .    2.877709476114513
the agreement with macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the european union , allowing this country to join , even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future .    3.317504270959554
in the meantime , we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for macedonian legislation to resemble that of the member states , and our policy should reflect this , even in the naming of aid programmes for macedonia .    2.7509270918082236
i would quote the phare programme as an example .    2.622530108286354
mr president , the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the greek UNK surrounding it .    2.9356951645600198
i assume that the member states will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic .    2.854410355851178
if certain countries wish to use the words " former yugoslavia " , then that is their business ; others need not feel obliged to copy them .    2.194347307582381
hence my support for the sound report by mr swoboda ; we have come to expect nothing less of him , and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected republic of macedonia .    2.5830720866988854
mr president , let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of mr swoboda ' s work as rapporteur .    2.757774090233712
today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the european union and the republic of macedonia .    3.00637817200711
we do so in the awareness that this decision , the very first relating to that area , is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the balkans .    2.927855236696641
this new phase , or rather policy , identifies the prospect of integrating the region into europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully .    2.2816491866741297
our agreement to the negotiations , as set out in the rapporteur ' s explanatory statement , is born of the conviction that it is right for union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire .    2.5181775478934996
this is the dual objective which i believe should be pursued . on the one hand , we must maintain programmes on , for example , infrastructure , preparations - still premature - for free trade , and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area , and on the other , it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia as an example of the policy .    3.320461511328117
and there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive .    3.2377063573904192
as we were able to ascertain during our missions to skopje , there has been considerable progress in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , as regards the economy , movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the balkans - multi - ethnic coexistence .    2.5856331399912476
on the other hand , the price macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring kosovo is very high , both in terms of UNK availability of nato forces and in terms of reduced exports to northern europe .    2.606683447220599
i conclude , mr president , by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult , fragile , and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated .    2.0397084919755555
mr president , commissioner , i rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .    2.261273854013297
we are extremely UNK that , along the lines set out by the rapporteur , mr swoboda , this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries , especially albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , montenegro and kosovo and , as soon as possible , serbia .    2.781983960807597
we are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence , with all the consequences of that in terms of continental , if not world , instability .    2.5856853157310127
if the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the union to the countries of eastern europe , that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with albania and the countries of former yugoslavia . and that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south - east europe that the agreements we are discussing represent .    2.708933667924971
it is in that quasi - provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south - east europe from foreign affairs to enlargement .    2.547759881440334
very rapid and direct involvement of south - east europe in the life of the european institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the european parliament , and that staff from those countries could work in the court of justice and the commission .    3.203452647314839
but if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market - based economy is to be encouraged , we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development .    2.8603802094914568
with this in mind , we have presented some amendments which i hope parliament will accept .    3.2891440995245977
first , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the european union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by macedonia to european products , on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of macedonia is accepted .    2.281941710354663
secondly , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia should be encouraged , with adequate financial support , to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the UNK of the whole macedonian economy , with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system .    2.66224089057285
mr president , commissioner , we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot UNK ourselves that peace , stability and prosperity in south - east europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide - ranging problems we are trying to eliminate .    2.5008287466606216
i am referring to the future constitutional state of kosovo , the need to involve serbia in the region ' s reconciliation process and - why not ? - new discussions on relations between the european union , nato and the un , in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty , which i think calls for a change in the existing un charter .    3.154746853693967
mr president , commissioner , the war in kosovo has knocked everything off balance .    2.3390250256107334
this is certainly true for the relations between the european union and the western balkans .    3.1496085586265994
since then , expectations have been high .    2.434483267382795
this applies to them and us .    2.9394948352061143
this is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what europe wants from them at the end of the day ?    2.3583437093640733
is there any prospect of membership ?    2.683265936393753
but here too , within the european union , expectations are high .    3.5154043700989868
if we do things properly , this may well be a first UNK of a genuine common foreign and security policy .    2.6240950901123825
will the union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy , for the first time , concerning such a difficult regulation ?    2.5903360921041223
it also remains to be seen whether the european union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in kosovo .    2.4768393307207246
can we , based on the experiences in macedonia and in four other countries , improve on this ?    3.0234022169445676
against this background of extremely high expectations , i do not think that i am UNK if i say that this first step , namely the stability and association agreement with macedonia , is vitally important .    3.120458086072217
this is not the union ' s only contribution .    3.3114036224696903
the debate on the stability pact , the debate on the UNK programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending .    3.460254634864608
we are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements , that is to say a medium - term issue .    3.111773816702874
i am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen .    2.788834104451135
what does the european union intend to do with macedonia ?    4.268077672360277
will it do the same to us ?    2.8118601920731474
this first step is so important because of this model function .    3.1603755908954176
the rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms , namely , the issue of UNK relations .    2.8564367265593495
there is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture .    2.370793016360967
during the presidential elections , it appeared that things were not running too smoothly , but compared to the rest of the region , macedonia could serve as a model .    2.4612027717645004
we would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western balkans with the help of the macedonians .    2.4499208708455935
this model function also applies to regional cooperation .    2.9041560914552855
i could not agree more with the rapporteur : a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards bulgaria and greece , and not cutting them off on the other .    2.6399700278253744
mr president , commissioner , if we manage this first step successfully , we will have gained a great deal .    3.013042576185744
if we mess it up , then we will have lost a great deal more .    3.0379423151902984
mr president , let me begin by saying that i have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle .    2.817778496327428
i am referring to the sanctions against yugoslavia .    2.47065889495872
do not misunderstand me : i too believe that we need to take effective action against the milosevic regime .    2.7836324587584467
secondly , the entire population of yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of milosevic and his circle , which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive .    2.602403405398164
so i believe that we should take today ' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions , as stated in amendment no 10 .    3.4733178865854883
mr president , we did not need to witness the end the kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that , after various wars in the territory of the former yugoslavia , with their UNK negative effects on the stability of the balkans , a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed , aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south - east europe .    2.6198945816995036
this strategy , which took shape in the stability pact adopted on 10 june 1999 in cologne , considers south - east europe as a whole , but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that UNK the region .    2.570667837169011
the european union ' s contribution under the stability pact , now converted into what is called the " stabilisation and association process " , represents a development in the regional concept the european community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region : bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , the federal republic of yugoslavia , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and albania . its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the dayton peace agreement , and it should therefore contribute to regional stability .    2.539331505700335
so establishing relations between the european union and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia on a completely new basis , and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the european union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process , constitutes an important contribution to stability in the balkans .    2.5506576611299896
the assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions .    3.090188133742147
the expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day , maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course .    2.8120403854811133
we are not UNK ourselves by believing that , once agreement is obtained , the mandate we are giving the commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long - suffering region , where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development .    2.602526067692883
they have suffered enough , first under the soviet UNK and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc .    2.234391662833559
the evidence is that the former yugoslav republic of macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the european union , going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 june 1998 , which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire , especially in key areas of the internal market .    2.838955424506107
it is true that the former yugoslav republic of macedonia still has a long way to go , but , given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement , and with transitional periods accepted for certain UNK , the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement .    3.092676698861077
we share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region , we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed , emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the european union , and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south - east europe , and that the issue is how the balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability .    3.269161240779128
the various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context .    2.6180753562132497
this agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region .    3.1906763481187057
that is why it is so important .    2.6070761959763
the point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the european union to draw closer to these countries .    2.881096411042165
we are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation , that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments , and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone , but they are all countries which now know that , once they have overcome their difficulties , a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the european union .    2.6351992687323373
mr president , commissioner , i am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow members .    2.5130149110483853
i think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy .    3.027579639791958
paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example .    2.630240295004318
we know there are 13 applicant countries , from lithuania to turkey , and just one black hole in europe , the balkans , but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants , we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle .    3.045296486654876
paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status .    1.9702247756636977
but this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy , it is also an UNK , because , if negotiations begin tomorrow , this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years .    3.2879913989938303
and i UNK you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from croatia , macedonia and bosnia , amongst the balkan countries , three years hence .    2.337157469771297
this would not be so serious if this region of europe were not so UNK by the problems we are all aware of , problems which are being addressed , but which have not yet been resolved , by the new government of macedonia . there are the problems of coexistence between the macedonian majority and the albanian minority , the connected problems of kosovo , the notorious economic problems , the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in serbia , and then there is the problem of the greek veto which must be condemned for what it is .    3.1733091699906137
it is absolutely absurd . apart from anything else it is offensive , in my opinion , to the greek meps and the citizens of greece .    2.7101640986285385
this question needs to be resolved urgently .    3.6198679310625623
finally , by happy chance , a letter from mr georgievski , president of macedonia to mr fischler , dated 8 march , has come into my hands . in it , referring to article o , now article 49 of the treaty , he asks if macedonia can join the european union .    2.2324329616964635
why has the council not informed us of this ?    2.5732059608880156
why has the commission not informed us of this formal request from macedonia ?    2.4259006977283253
mr president , commissioner , the balkans are not purely a dark UNK , politically speaking .    2.253097670342445
the decidedly positive developments in the republic of macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves .    2.788093838325805
the gruesome UNK of ethnic violence in neighbouring kosovo did not reach its territory .    2.289206509665919
from the point of view of the macedonian majority , the albanian minority behaved UNK towards the common state during the international explosion of the kosovo conflict .    2.373492262794857
in the eyes of the albanian minority , the macedonians and the macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of kosovo ' s albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme .    2.0884428341305123
this remarkable upshot of the kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal , political establishment of the republic of macedonia the second time round .    2.375321219126501
mr swoboda ' s well - balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level .    2.149121110265402
mr president , as one who has been concerned with macedonia for eight years , i have to contradict mr dupuis .    2.6130684714936168
we have reached a UNK moment and i think the macedonians are glad about it .    2.7192028973002236
please stop being so unpleasant and UNK cold water on everything .    2.189192373079429
i think we should take a more positive approach here .    2.695353434025886
macedonia did not go through a war .    2.7841457704060812
but it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions , as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries .    2.7820577630272516
it suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the kosovo war .    2.1644176591203603
so we must admit that developments in macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines .    2.1517578493539338
this is a country that has difficult inter - ethnic problems to deal with at home , and is resolving them with increasing success .    2.735358759246376
i am glad to see that the hope mr swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in march , i . e . that we will finally have an eu delegation there and that we , as the european union , will finally have a greater role to play there .    3.1526912803849543
as a sign of our political commitment , we must finally show macedonia in practice that we are indeed UNK its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects .    2.5721961590659865
let me name just two small ones : the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with kosovo in UNK and the creation of UNK 8 , from albania via macedonia to bulgaria .    2.4951029361033377
i think mr swoboda has drafted an excellent report , and it has my wholehearted support .    2.7772997993224733
mr president , i too would like to compliment mr swoboda on his report .    2.293962871201337
i think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it .    2.9203448782884047
the report UNK stability in the region in a structural manner . this is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the republic of macedonia which we are debating today .    3.467623551364983
although the actual implementation of the stability pact has not yet started , the commission has already developed the new instrument , entitled the stabilisation and association agreement .    2.9955880450263663
this marks the beginning of the treaty - based stabilising process for the countries of the former yugoslavia .    3.443358981120986
these countries do not yet qualify for a pre - accession agreement .    2.5544870363543506
the present agreement is a kind of pre - pre - agreement , but with a view to joining in future .    2.850098121624908
the instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent , provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented UNK , so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained .    2.5708610352127605
macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match .    2.4602307497388787
it does , however , have the ambition to break free from this image .    2.7433385279118427
this requires internal stability .    2.728547543951279
the new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms , including a direct role and equality for the albanian minority .    2.7902182108554396
more than anything , the country needs peace and quiet now , in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity .    3.0591881845052558
we , the social democrats , would urge the opposition to back these ideas .    2.78778379718664
they need to help support the much - praised macedonian model .    2.4885916332084057
but the country also - and especially - needs external stability .    2.4075932922052905
what is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable ?    2.324099497126993
this stability is required in the relations with yugoslavia , kosovo , albania and bulgaria .    2.3838600117362847
the region should recognise that macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist .    3.176860576458146
external stability also means open borders and regional cooperation .    2.5066403907840047
minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange .    2.8470040358218145
macedonia ' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries .    2.843956465424556
it seems that the albania factor is being underestimated .    2.3160120643603497
the union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country .    2.6074609866170593
but what then instead ?    2.6760819856076057
it is the very argument to conclude an agreement with macedonia and not yet with albania that cause us so much concern , so much so that a passive stance from the union vis - à - vis albania is really not acceptable .    2.2299240127889792
what does the commission intend to do regarding this issue ?    2.756806650203963
we need to wait and see what happens there .    2.8655467495154707
the mood in belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day .    2.167652117185954
what else will the union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met ?    2.445207358049786
what else can we do to support this opposition ?    3.0454830704996447
mr president , commissioner , kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could UNK minorities in the most UNK way on the grounds that " it is happening within their own nation " .    2.2014713684861342
when the usa and nato and , finally , also the eu , reacted , it was already late , in fact very late .    3.141454027714003
a great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the eu , among others , has acted earlier and more decisively .    2.8223654050606304
we , the european union , therefore have a special responsibility to help , support and rebuild the balkans now .    2.8892158079055554
our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south - east europe to be integrated with other countries in the eu - economically , politically and in terms of trade .    3.1396301178721298
fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war - UNK part of europe is best provided through trade and economic integration .    2.3663619467674852
we liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly , just as UNK costa reported .    3.1322812569866207
it is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with macedonia , and we thank mr swoboda for a very good report .    3.0770873203990496
macedonia deserves our support , especially in view of the self - UNK , UNK work which the people and leaders of macedonia undertook during the kosovo war .    3.0657380616520813
now that macedonia is UNK itself loose from the crushing embrace of communism and nationalism , it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms .    2.389760633385924
we should do exactly the same for the other countries in the balkans .    3.2781039070352356
this is an urgent duty for the eu .    2.675127595033794
mr president , allow me in this context to remind meps - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war , human degradation , murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of yugoslavia , namely serbia .    2.3453298362591477
the man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the hague still goes free .    2.336219282760067
i am talking about milosevic .    2.6386353289251883
as long as milosevic is still there and serbia is not pursuing a democratic path , serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the balkans , including in macedonia .    2.1593361422313344
mr president , the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the stability pact in south - eastern europe ,    3.188521581901264
its terms , which the swoboda report accepts , are certainly not directed towards peace , but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country , and towards controlling its natural wealth , UNK its workforce and continuing to use that country as a UNK against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order .    2.496141984620711
all this , in exchange for the promise of future accession to the european union .    2.506421406929919
the report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the european union on south - eastern europe .    3.044179789938836
it is characteristic that the report congratulates fyrom on the constructive stance it maintained during the nato attack , UNK its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for nato forces , but , of course , remains silent about the indignation of its people , which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the nato bombardments .    2.3598629231715313
finally , because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the european union is implementing in countries in that area , will create new problems there , new UNK for their peoples , and will reinforce the dominant role of the american and european UNK , we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of fyrom .    3.242464386556287
mr president , commissioner , one of the most basic aims of the european union ' s stability and association agreement with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area , and this , of course , presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved .    3.2564900248567876
i shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name fyrom , which as you must know , is the subject of a difference of opinion with greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years , under the aegis of the secretary general of the un in the context of related security council resolutions , but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to article 5 of the so - termed intermediate agreement of 1995 .    2.6993513653435723
i do , however , think it appropriate to say that , at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement , the european side must point out to the skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will , so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in new york .    3.409248699828228
i should like to hope that such an appeal from europe , with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement , would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the skopje government , so that it can respond appropriately , on the one hand , to greece ' s UNK conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue , and , on the other hand , to the more general practical , declared intention and UNK of all the partners in the european union , including greece , to facilitate and support fyrom ' s progress towards a united europe .    2.7534395511932
mr president , this is because i do not think that the harmonious day to day relations , contacts and communication between fyrom and greece that have actually been achieved at both UNK and UNK level , and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement , i repeat , i do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good UNK necessary , inter alia , for negotiating and concluding an association agreement .    2.3653727054117764
on the contrary , i think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de UNK full normalisation of fyrom ' s relations with all its neighbours .    2.5296585636492104
that , combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country , in the area of minorities and democratic institutions , would round off the image of political maturity which fyrom has , in fact , presented in other respects and which has made our european family welcome closer relations with it .    2.702151008592317
mr president , the agreement we are debating today , as analysed by mr swoboda , which i hope we will adopt tomorrow , constitutes the second politically positive step , after the stability pact for the area .    2.844443563388244
there is another small step , which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for yugoslavia .    2.516286121021061
for about 10 years , the situation in the area has been fluid .    3.970106109962174
both as an historical period and , in particular , as a political period , 10 years is a very long time .    3.3521758557399295
under those conditions , then , there has been a real failure .    3.21546839993543
in that sense , the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow , which contributes towards stability in the area , is de facto a move in the right direction .    2.7734310309904373
in essence , fyrom is a UNK version of the former yugoslavia , regardless of where one or another minority holds UNK .    2.7571498596182398
from that standpoint , the fact that so far it has resisted any UNK from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us , any state , any policy or any view , UNK that small republic towards external , disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems , granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy .    2.2445195724122673
in that area , there have been various policies from time to time , and what the european union should guard against is the risk that , for ultimately superficial reasons , it may help to create banana republics elsewhere .    2.9457706027612076
we must be sure that , in seeking allies in the area , we must not always choose anyone who offers .    3.5253496686227064
we must choose those which are moderate , which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area .    2.8215393395158404
i hope and wish , and am indeed certain , that the european union , with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt , will little by little construct , in the wider area , the necessary environment which it needs itself .    2.779084512310164
in any event , speaking now as a greek , i want to tell some of the speakers i listened to earlier that much of what was said is UNK on other times and places .    2.532148235717864
you should know that the country which cooperates most with fyrom and has the best relations with it , in the entire area , is greece , and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area .    3.0630299535470327
i say this just so that we know where we stand .    3.1346886219949908
. this has been a very interesting general debate about the balkans as a whole .    3.367481360672309
it was none the worse for that , but perhaps i will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that i want to touch on .    2.9731226157464326
i am delighted to be able to be able to set out the commission ' s position on the report .    4.033951932237439
it is very helpful .    2.828266007853729
it is an excellent contribution by mr swoboda and his colleagues .    2.8962848943180846
we are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues , a number of whom are in the house this evening - mrs pack , mr lagendijk and others .    2.952674161135174
i am very pleased that at our overall relations with fyrom are in such a good state .    2.4409398960853403
perhaps mr dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of UNK UNK .    2.2842983718759435
that has been helped by our excellent european union representative in the country .    2.645765241810531
the imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations .    2.490545008651375
so to is the cooperation of fyrom in the rebuilding of kosovo .    2.6961048395930005
i am grateful to the authorities in macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in kosovo .    2.33503467363834
i saw the newly - elected president georgievski a few weeks ago and i was extremely impressed , as others have been , by his commitment to multi - ethnicity and UNK .    2.222262630331924
let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as mr lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest .    2.260691297266064
the council adopted on 24 january this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .    2.0731249413284245
this represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western balkans region initiated by the commission in may 1999 .    3.3724422574611888
let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives .    2.3108348338010476
they cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the european union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement .    2.8605818251140755
they cover provisions on the movement of workers , freedom of establishment , supply of services , current payments and movement of capital .    2.486769642602471
they cover a commitment by fyrom to approximate its legislation to that of the european community , notably in key areas of the internal market ; and they cover provisions on cooperation with fyrom in a wide range of fields , including justice and home affairs .    2.6590415994148224
we are now making in the commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in march .    2.8254306647362397
i am due to visit fyrom in the second week in march .    2.4680981250192167
i hope to be able to set the process in motion then , although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter .    2.6150977811350566
at the time of that visit i will also , as recommended by honourable members and others , be upgrading our representation in fyrom .    2.467341708327819
the target date for concluding the negotiations is december this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators .    2.1479173917323013
the agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now , given the time needed for ratification in member states ' parliaments .    2.8261794662441915
i should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution .    3.0097286063140096
we accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements , although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries , each of which has its own identity and its own concerns .    2.9188512768007686
i share the wide - spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not UNK everyone to the pace of the UNK in the development of relations with the union .    3.070269112907324
that has never been the intention .    3.0489562716115013
the very fact that negotiations are beginning first with fyrom , before all the others , is evidence that we can and do differentiate .    2.5516140486134558
on the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross - border or regional dimension .    2.6678153339915696
we agree that there should be an UNK clause on the prospect of eu membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement .    2.6100511838728577
it will reflect the european union ' s position on its relations with the countries of the western balkans as set out in the cologne european council conclusions .    3.2332458698897137
we strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent .    2.709712236778053
as for the arrangements covering european union assistance to the western balkans , members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and UNK their management and to put everything under one regulation .    2.802542704154553
i am aware that there is concern in fyrom and elsewhere at the end of the phare programme in these countries and , especially , at the loss of association with the phare name .    3.066395580855935
i note with considerable concern what members say on this score .    2.227144859307087
i will take another look at the issue , although i should point out that having two phare programmes up and running risks real confusion .    2.787798104203652
i want to stress , however , that whatever the programme is called , our commitment to the integration of fyrom and its neighbours into the european family is stronger than ever .    2.8943999585888665
in general i trust that members of this house will share my pleasure that macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly .    2.4148018352766143
i hope that the other countries of the region will UNK their efforts to make similar progress .    3.072384053789777
i look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking , i hope , the success of what we are trying to do in the balkans which , for me , remains the single most important litmus - test of what europe is able to do on its own doorstep .    2.963907688865924
thank you very much , commissioner patten .    2.1334526225371873
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.676484096263824
agreement on comitology    3.6402004662237735
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0021 / 2000 ) by mrs frassoni , on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the agreement between the european parliament and the commission on the implementation of the new council decision of 28 june 1999 on comitology ( 1999 / 468 / ec ) .    2.575282253539448
. ( it ) mr president , the approval of this agreement with the commission on procedures for implementing the council decision on comitology marks the end of a UNK which has kept parliament busy for two years , along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the union , whom many people do not hesitate to call UNK .    3.1057519699254534
until 1993 , the way the commission exercised its executive powers , and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements , was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions , and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure .    2.3209234657938755
that is why , in accordance with declaration no 31 , annexed to the treaty of amsterdam , the union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation , resulting in the new council decision , which UNK the old system quite substantially , although we are not entirely satisfied with it .    2.7971477966566782
in particular , the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure , deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure , UNK the implementing powers delegated to the commission .    2.3240959791011617
during the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw parliament actively involved , thanks to the work of the rapporteur , UNK UNK - it was understood that the european parliament and commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision . on the one hand , certain points which the council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and , on the other , the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely .    3.1578633698063863
during the UNK held on 6 october 1999 in strasbourg , the presidents of the european parliament and the commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon .    2.9337473133926157
we believe we have respected that commitment , and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the commission .    2.4599086622848856
essentially , the agreement deals with two points : one is the right of the european parliament to be informed , which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to article 8 of the decision .    3.0210555754005806
hitherto , such information had been UNK on paper and UNK , and was of no use to our services ; and indeed this was often the fault of parliament itself .    2.547178460353724
from now on , the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called UNK , to which the european parliament will have access . this represents a real innovation , not only for us , but also - i am sure - for the commission .    3.8548880657547415
the other point is that article 8 of the council decision does not specify either the method by which the european parliament is to sound the alarm , or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control .    2.7312724265313717
paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that , as a general rule , the european parliament will adopt its resolution , stating its reasons , at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the commission adopts the draft implementing measure .    2.673959972480722
but we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure .    2.9361055084462584
therefore , the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure , including possible action by the committee responsible .    2.7651635150097995
i want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not , we must wait and see how it works in practice .    3.2856462136023725
the european parliament needs to acquire the resources , which it currently lacks , to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures , and the commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to parliament and ensure that control can be effective .    2.8950937186476122
finally , it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the european parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the treaties , and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an UNK that severely restricts the commission ' s executive power and may prejudice the european parliament ' s legislative powers .    2.953156784551944
mr president , comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means .    2.3816007124413665
it makes them think of secret societies and UNK , which is the way things used to be .    3.4003050162568598
in fact , it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the commission .    2.2714937462198237
the procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures .    2.5699651982395153
up until the amsterdam treaty , there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures , which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens .    2.4408903505373907
on the contrary , for a long time even the european parliament was not informed .    3.454233631442579
for the european parliament , the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed , at least , of all that the european commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees .    3.6438575748921984
agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between lord plumb and mr delors .    2.4368493588436415
a further step towards transparency and the involvement of the european parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 september 1994 , which granted parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases .    2.9363430028724817
it also gave it the possibility of scrutiny .    2.924371592544252
with the amsterdam treaty , the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the european parliament had long wanted - to three procedures , the administrative procedure , the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure .    2.6849822811256576
now , following the amsterdam treaty , the rights of information and control granted to the european parliament in the past need to be enshrined UNK in an interinstitutional agreement .    4.182958013311351
mrs frassoni , our rapporteur , has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within parliament .    3.0554904225327855
a key problem is the time factor .    3.025577727847736
when the european parliament is informed , it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks , should it so wish .    2.5754990020073776
in matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the european union , the european commission , as guardian of the treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative , must be in a position to react very rapidly , if necessary within a few hours or days .    3.7184385274845684
nevertheless , the european parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react .    3.1124698699932787
our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties , which i and my group can only support in full .    2.643419714075994
i just have one more request .    2.634551042792914
in the german version , paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather UNK and i urgently ask for clarification , which i would also like to see in the UNK version later .    3.2985161037629114
in my view , instead of " UNK werden müssen " the wording should be " UNK UNK müssen " .    2.3882292195557184
the german version is not very clear here .    2.8718959606072176
i would ask for that to be checked again .    2.3968013807389164
for the rest , i warmly thank our rapporteur .    2.7922327977750325
it is a difficult subject and i hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now .    3.3855275951090924
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on her report .    2.4501315674279156
i must add that it is a welcome change to see mrs frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions .    2.855524799137186
when it comes to the igc , she is one of what the french call " UNK UNK et UNK " : no compromise , no deals with the other institutions ; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions .    2.545148199000596
yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved , which are far from UNK parliament ' s original position on the issue of comitology .    3.6969284141250816
let us remember what is at stake here .    2.7460985068574457
parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement .    2.385096540526837
firstly , the whole system is obscure .    3.08773865902636
it is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees .    2.216878440724853
here is a real step forward , in the new system that has been agreed .    4.913583818828359
we are to know who is on each committee .    2.8362930849672643
we are to know when they meet .    2.7190348287921076
we are to get the agendas .    3.037576792668503
we are to get the documents that are sent to them .    2.8167352043194427
the whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex .    2.6340695651258295
so that is at least a step forward .    2.9401097474854443
our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the commission .    2.960755705757496
we adopt legislation in the european union .    2.972870039810121
we expect the commission to implement it .    3.1318848557804695
and then we have a system designed to hinder the commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the " contre - UNK " system , under which the council could block the commission by a simple majority even when the council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned .    2.621276915695421
here too there is at least some progress .    2.712879018429153
the council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three - month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it , in other words , unless there is substantial opposition among the member states represented in the council .    2.9018081843931705
that is a more reasonable system .    2.715995308385095
that , too , is a step forward .    4.2519262157526825
but on our other two criticisms , we are less satisfied .    2.954481729223705
the first criticism is of the system whereby the commission is monitored , scrutinised , controlled if you like , only by a committee appointed by member states or the council not by parliament .    2.81454852627516
the legislative authority , council and parliament , should be equal .    3.2460142870708584
we confer implementing powers on the commission , but then it is only a council or member state appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the commission and stop the implementing measure .    2.952903996888186
true , we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system .    3.88615666211168
we are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee .    3.0441710206329495
we will have the chance to scrutinise , to debate , to question .    2.8756310704301518
but we will only have the right to formally challenge the commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the commission in the legislation .    3.4948023762628533
in other words , we can challenge the measure for being ultra - UNK but not on its content .    2.3721673562427394
and in a democracy , parliament should be able to challenge the content .    3.7655115465483804
not that we do so every week .    3.2355815207831107
we are not seeking to UNK ourselves in implementing decisions , but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary .    3.448596754508598
that is lacking in this new system , or at least is only there in embryonic form .    2.499253083897345
finally , our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back , not to both branches of the legislative authority , but to the council alone , which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure .    2.6170333816029037
that is not correct .    2.9322050223032017
both branches adopt the legislation - council and parliament - that confers implementing powers on the commission .    2.563883278764152
if such implementing measures are referred back , it should be to both branches , not to one branch alone .    2.8400891174121083
overall we have a system which has made some progress .    3.6361087952316113
the supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the commission are welcome , but that could not change the basic decision of the council .    3.1321337456876135
even here , we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the plumb - delors agreement as part of the overall compromise .    2.8152596963172867
we have been willing to UNK the provisions in that .    3.0872713573197683
we shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision .    3.3769511972824873
we must be very vigilant .    3.042851671654021
my group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward .    2.8348173886581343
we recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years ' time .    2.9649655931003362
if we want a union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject .    2.5452426814862266
mr president , first i want to thank the rapporteur , mrs frassoni , for her work .    2.797193631457189
it is never easy working on comitology .    2.4116984861650064
mrs schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic , something we have long talked about .    2.6347755907118406
certainly the process has always been very complex , as a result of historical decisions , and these must eventually be rationalised .    2.879682922001941
in my opinion , the agreement reached between commission and parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process .    2.9728289848562572
from our point of view , it satisfies the fundamental interests of parliament .    2.735259352272947
mr corbett set out parliament ' s concerns .    3.0182600487657627
he says some of them have been satisfied and others have not .    2.9978182935008486
i would say the ones the commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied .    2.784504186669818
mr corbett is raising issues the council decision does not cover , and unfortunately we can go no further on those .    2.3255763938776215
so how far have we come ?    2.613442605012071
there is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point , highlighted by mrs frassoni , given that we now have an automatic information system .    2.8312431966041345
this will facilitate two activities parliament is especially interested in .    2.240849938427449
one is knowing how the committees operate , about their composition , agendas , descriptions , and so on , and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions .    2.695721412293924
i think this is a good agreement .    3.3277927263537426
it is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process .    2.491765784481433
from here on things are going to be easier .    3.2394275313059993
but the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the plumb / delors agreement .    2.533439706874802
mr corbett referred to that , but the new model is certainly much more complex , different because the situation is now different , and , in our opinion , much more coherent .    3.0933209073182986
we have made a start , and we hope the work will produce some excellent results .    2.951752646486188
we think there are other positive advances too .    2.7617468471316666
to a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and , by UNK old procedures with the new situation , we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past .    2.532206369474849
from the commission ' s point of view , our conclusion is that this is a good agreement , and we want to thank the members of parliament who worked on it - especially mrs frassoni .    4.000437622908793
we hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking , which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the commission as an executive .    2.8697394401802874
thank you very much , commissioner solbes mira .    2.0210055059746748
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.676484096263824
protocol on the excessive deficit procedure    2.9912746676784474
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0013 / 2000 ) by mr knörr borràs , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on a proposal for a council regulation amending regulation ( ec ) no 3605 / 93 on the application of the protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the treaty establishing the european community ( com ( 1999 ) 444 - c5 - 0174 / 1999 - 1999 / 0196 ( cns )    1.9159969747680266
mr president , i am also pleased to welcome the spanish commissioner , mr solbes mira , whom i have congratulated more than once , inside and outside this parliament , on the excellent work he did in spain on the subject of european convergence .    2.7892012364832057
the proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the protocol on the excessive deficit procedure , annexed to the treaty of maastricht , raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 european system of accounts , which , as you know , replaced the previous system of accounts adopted in 1979 , and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories , consistency in the calculation of the UNK of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of esa 95 and , finally , recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology .    2.5236279448738483
in our view , the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to update the definitions and the assessments of some of the economic operations involved in the calculation of deficits , as reflected in the treaty establishing the european community , the treaty of maastricht , which lays down the maximum percentages which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of gdp at market prices in the various member states .    2.6366617281716778
to date , the member states have calculated this gdp in accordance with the criteria laid down in esa 79 .    3.038476508014669
therefore , if the regulation is adopted , the estimate which is due to appear in march 2000 , the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year , will be made using the new system .    2.8173624756748454
we know the member states have done their duty - if i can use that expression - doing their calculations and preparing their national accounts in line with esa 95 , and they have already published their corresponding estimates .    2.4596266047194586
in addition to incorporating a new methodology , this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations , on account of the aforesaid methodological changes , and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates .    2.4137533691810757
these changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the member states ' national accounting .    2.941527742636688
i will now describe , very briefly , the five areas where the most important changes may occur .    2.836443487096484
first , the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by ' government institutional sector ' under esa 95 .    2.482825244582795
this is important , since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government .    2.3971078895372058
the non - availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the member states ' government deficits .    2.835940384045225
thirdly , government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector , as defined in esa 95 .    2.3964393613860526
fourthly , government debt is defined in accordance with esa 95 , as are the flows or interest stemming from assets / UNK .    2.1978898819633694
fifthly and finally , the UNK to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices , estimated in accordance with the 1995 european system of accounts ' definitions .    2.568451590234178
to summarise , i consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 european system of accounts , and i therefore approve it in full , as did the committee .    2.7909069158636335
mr president , commissioner , let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it makes the basic statistical data for an economic and monetary union directed at stability and real growth more harmonised , directly comparable and more accurate .    2.2459738276558165
we have already heard about the various aspects involved .    2.6868561452723805
we need that because the various european union bodies and all the member states within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another .    3.270043649422469
it is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons .    2.6019334506844327
firstly , for the single market .    4.108581843522676
it is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends .    2.620470038053536
secondly , for economic and monetary union .    2.729665967085839
the regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the european system of accounts at national and regional level .    2.6695185478791883
that is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits .    2.4667073695941744
this adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the member states more precisely .    2.7482820155597523
these technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries , since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit .    3.7291123674328444
i also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in march 2000 are already based on the new esa , i . e . the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant .    2.5429972769146203
let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit .    2.663330292178847
it is good that the procedure exists .    2.4887426533695547
we need it because it UNK our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility .    2.476592177835484
the citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met .    2.4700672293687713
thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously .    2.7813091681222564
another important point is that we must do all we can , not just to prevent excessive deficits , but also to further reduce public deficits .    3.4272187761670634
i know what i am talking about and i will conclude by telling you why i am so glad we are holding this debate !    2.7580178045235684
we are currently holding a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually gave us accurate information on the deficit .    2.610791261576478
in my country , austria , new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach .    2.565579230576584
i must also tell you that in the year 2000 , when there is so much talk about us , the coalition talks with the spö failed - and unfortunately so - because the socialist party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme .    2.640016182961874
that is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in austria ; for the austrian people ' s party , the övp , wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability . the övp wants to ensure that we continue to meet the maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit , as we have agreed here .    2.806948174100475
mr president , the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable .    2.6600043178040704
this is of great importance , especially in the light of european unification and the completion of the internal market .    2.7513683349326463
this is why this report is also so politically charged : a report , by the way , on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly .    3.3511194255368144
it also UNK a few political comments .    3.083230144453366
the stability pact is a given in europe .    2.711625215401763
all countries participating in the euro have committed themselves , in the medium term , to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus .    2.5397632172228706
this , of course , does not mean that , if the economic climate is less than favourable , the budget could not UNK up or down slightly . it means that , in the long and medium term , there should be a balance or surplus .    3.0592818374085793
the stronger the position of the participating countries , the stronger the euro will be .    2.7633231249422616
as a result , the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded , not even in a bad economic climate .    2.3461398824128383
this is the theory behind it , anyway .    2.409151659334904
we have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be UNK met .    2.866552780502727
that is of great importance in order to turn the emu into a success , now and in the future .    3.2480620182753874
strict compliance with the stability pact can thus contribute to a culture of stability within all emu member states .    2.5796983593729004
various member states have taken one - off measures to be able to meet the criteria .    3.6401847618304286
we are of the opinion that the member states ' budget policy should be strictly supervised , to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times .    3.1808656934982187
a drop in standards should not be allowed .    3.077320708407222
we are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised .    2.572787105102946
indeed , we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations .    2.436084955845466
. ( es ) mr president , many thanks , first of all , to the rapporteur for his splendid work .    3.384292131207399
it was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and i think mr knörr has handled it with great precision and professionalism .    2.379200854294067
i would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal better than he has done ; i would just like to add one small point : in addition to adaptation to esa 95 , there are two small technical changes which mr knörr knows all about , relating to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency .    2.4638303102647385
i just mention that to complete the view of the process .    3.1128383947947196
secondly , i would like to thank mr knörr for his UNK .    2.8586467900325103
he has done really good work in a very short time .    3.084162702604146
this is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently .    3.02836773418568
what we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable .    2.6084872977351745
obviously , the fact that parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the march figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria .    2.7725180016702
that being so , i believe the final result will be better .    3.3502628028924266
the figures will be more reliable and more comparable and i think the concerns some members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed .    2.728079811854606
this regulation is purely instrumental .    2.8080032362280356
it does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised .    3.018933796834907
but we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem .    3.098714989527885
the stability pact is in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitoring compliance by the various member states , despite the fact that the results are clearly positive in all the member states where we have analysed the position as regards the stability of the government deficit .    3.52596393861332
we must press on in that direction because we know it is vital .    2.9284082890646435
so , once again - and finally - i want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better UNK .    2.4104152673914223
thank you very much , commissioner solbes mira .    2.0210055059746748
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.676484096263824
increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro    3.351657384110503
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0020 / 2000 ) by mrs cederschiöld , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on a draft framework decision of the council on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro ( 5116 / 1999 - c5 - 0332 / 1999 - 1999 / 0821 ( cns ) .    2.151690800320041
.    2.489189446364389
( sv ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen ( all the more welcome for being so few in number ) , one might have thought that it was an UNK subject which was to be discussed at this hour , but that is not the case .    2.769408808797899
it is a definite and concrete issue . it is about our common currency .    3.0719174548776085
we cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited .    2.174531344010825
the ecb , ecofin , europol , olaf and the commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation .    2.5711890261969192
it is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced .    2.5483991128669254
it is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions .    2.6187034412259966
this is something which parliament has said it wants to see added .    2.514967312026912
the council ought to have given parliament the stipulated three - month period within which to consider , too , the last document produced on this matter , but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place .    2.8706170748478015
because the issue is to be decided upon in march in the council , parliament has cause to adopt a position on the proposal now , so that the member states have time also to take due account of parliament ' s points of view in the decision which has to be made in march .    4.152629323394927
any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency , and that country would be accountable , both UNK and economically , if its actions were to contribute to a delay .    2.604679896209133
a country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself .    2.7722208584467354
on 1 january 2002 the euro will be in circulation .    3.048675805587355
it is important that , in time , there should be a more or less similar - looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries .    3.1072595354265213
the commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information , together with penal sanctions , preventive measures and the pooling of experience .    2.6237832872362183
these measures do , in fact , entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years ' imprisonment .    2.487847677690332
trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences .    2.099964790189432
quite simply , we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty .    3.6157144171099334
the UNK of the euro are well known .    3.403649511538163
modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves .    3.1372192181390277
parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal , for example in regard to jurisdiction , the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime .    3.014247607899722
there are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting , this being a measure which we would encourage .    2.6982395970095823
the new applicant states are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations .    2.600376372620513
it has taken two years for the council and the commission to produce this proposal .    3.386124377212286
it is essential that the decision should now be taken in march .    2.8978002446909166
to delay , or perhaps even risk damage to the euro , would be UNK .    3.168289158480455
it would also be a UNK of the people who will be handling the new , UNK notes .    3.624203190446982
in particular , it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone , where people are less familiar with the new currency .    2.759706081157363
the protective measures cover these countries too , and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight .    2.816349144661936
the present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character , accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others .    2.1921968606628415
the council must now UNK in march and make the relevant decision .    2.6588029285849966
thank you for listening .    2.780172152908258
mr president , first i want to compliment the rapporteur , charlotte cederschiöld , on drawing up this report , which is an excellent point of departure for increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro .    2.6752317643313885
the euro will enter into circulation on 1 january 2002 and will become one of the world ' s most important reserve currencies .    2.8074235245654005
due to its importance on a world scale , the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery .    2.6298748635092952
this draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each member state simpler and more effective .    2.5377727461795416
it also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation , which will fill a gap in legislation in some member states .    2.465917550906516
i expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation .    2.8521768469290785
this means that every member state must guarantee the establishment of effective , adequate penal sanctions , which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision .    2.6216614517476446
as to the proposal to establish a maximum UNK sentence of not less than eight years , i do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned , even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison , as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment .    2.9879641100378143
i also call on those few member states still UNK reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter , for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done .    2.609784365794798
mr president , this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward , with legislation to be applied by all fifteen member states at the same time .    2.6784070714101618
we are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the european union as an area of freedom , security and justice , as expressed at tampere .    2.6684333524806227
mr president , i need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points mr UNK made . all that is indeed very true and correct .    2.257907808189243
it is easy to counterfeit the euro .    2.330287605032852
we are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history .    2.22434093272966
it is that a currency that does not even exist yet , that is not in circulation , but exists only as bank deposit money , can nevertheless be counterfeited already . yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such , counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence .    2.4568421100719613
it is a highly complex problem .    2.7670415489486744
if we do not act promptly - as mrs cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation .    2.043012774093251
let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people .    2.672625796280124
so what is the european union doing about it ?    3.9108841042821894
it is doing a number of things that are right , as mrs cederschiöld has described ; but , in the context of these things she described , parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision , not so much at the report drawn up by mrs cederschiöld , but more at the procedures that are being applied .    2.955588357183477
the manner in which the council , which is by far the most undemocratic institution in europe , consulted the european parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy .    3.6432553315260203
we received a text for consultation which the council had been working on for a very long time , incidentally with only partial success - i will come to that in a moment .    2.8172168699365385
now the european parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex , difficult and , at times , contradictory council document in the space of three months .    2.8500029602895887
it is only thanks to the immense efforts of mrs cederschiöld and to parliament ' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages , that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the council , so that the decision scheduled for march can indeed be taken .    2.9576864528040887
on a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the council is demanding of us .    2.1090560166843613
so let me state quite clearly here , on behalf of my group , that we discussed at length with mrs cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this .    2.598767579753561
we concluded that it is not , but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure .    3.343723017768505
this framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress .    2.5282208909941946
only , as mrs cederschiöld pointed out , in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with . they relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish , the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all member states , including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited .    2.824823500670557
one reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the UNK cannot change its spots , i . e . in the case of this framework decision , which specifically relates to judicial cooperation , the council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation .    2.866571595592925
that is why , and i quote , this framework decision " is confined to supplementing the provisions of the international convention of 20 april 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its protocol " , i . e . the provisions of a UNK international convention that is a good 71 years old .    2.5958617951980796
that means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from community legislation , as it should , but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years .    2.891712950720281
i leave it to the assembled company in this chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a european union based on judicial cooperation .    3.318677539106505
thank you for your attention during our night sitting together .    2.262288973067825
mr president , the launch of the euro could well be a heaven - sent opportunity for counterfeiters .    2.3561948838670967
the fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references , and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article .    2.5504081363395574
so the council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions , primarily criminal , applicable in all the countries of europe , against offences of this kind .    2.756929081574605
no doubt the council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that member states adopt national legislation to that effect .    2.5371426530297168
that is what i would have preferred , personally .    3.142815188907689
but , probably through lack of confidence in the UNK of certain members , the council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at european level : a framework decision .    3.2091113110084146
now that is where the difficulties begin , because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the treaty of maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro - so as not to UNK the voters by over - UNK the UNK .    2.53508423899527
the draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this UNK by referring to articles 31 and 34 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the treaty .    2.4649815119650538
however , i find these UNK inadequate .    2.5491788429293334
article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases , specifically restricted to organised crime , terrorism and drug trafficking .    2.0807803164662655
counterfeiting is not on the list .    2.7334450627826783
article 34 , a product of the treaty of amsterdam , only lays down the new form of a framework decision , and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the european union .    3.002159755542192
so we come back to the previous problem .    3.2897839854420825
in other words , the council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis .    2.5135715910462153
in a way , this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty , at the time , in presenting the maastricht treaty to the voters .    3.0958592432680914
i would also like to make a more general point .    2.938425628441885
not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part - session .    2.626119098932667
but there has been nothing for a year .    3.1227815109214467
just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting .    2.5624790230983785
the commission ' s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000 - 2005 , which we have debated this week , contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject , except the reminder , in a single line , that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 january 2002 .    2.615670448375584
however , there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved .    2.995114711125393
mr president , for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money .    2.073447001201787
these are gigantic problems but they seem to be UNK here .    3.049762409739633
i should like to take over the UNK from the previous speaker .    3.47682804625717
there are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions , because the point of departure is , of course , that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern .    3.3245633459660993
criminal law is part of each individual nation ' s own cultural tradition , and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts .    3.2103380933724983
i appreciate mrs cederschiöld ' s work , and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the tampere summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied .    2.4315044412874958
she would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the eu .    2.63489228498154
but the problem is that there is no legal basis for this , and with good reason , because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction .    3.6933070015741505
in that context , i want to ask the following question of the commission ' s and the council ' s representatives : is the legal basis which has been UNK adequate ?    4.336907331168549
in my view , it is clearly in conflict with , and far exceeds the scope of , article 34 , paragraph 2 , point b where a legal basis is established for so - called framework decisions which are binding upon the member states in regard to the desired objectives , but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation .    3.0986708726004992
what of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the member states ' obligations are laid down in detail . there is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation .    3.1147514112132155
in my view , this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis .    2.607580463068081
i should like an answer from the commission and the council , for i consider it obvious that article 31 does not supply the relevant legal basis .    2.7256555416813497
mr president , commissioner , let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that , in her report , she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes , which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now , to supplement and improve the text .    2.4869474465409556
it is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to UNK this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made .    2.8991019156959767
we have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it .    2.241856259453714
so , in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting , to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions , the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do .    3.1286888352940943
we are also concerned with the question of cooperation .    3.4100234828484686
we need to define the precise responsibilities of the ecb , the national central banks , the commission and europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro .    2.7613223450680096
i also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or eu body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work .    2.3123882624024272
in the same context , we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock , together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities .    2.4932501707635524
aside from the report , which we welcome , many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved .    3.3183980660154466
i hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification .    2.5005467032557207
mr president , mrs cederschiöld , ladies and gentlemen , how safe is the euro ?    2.562366968586887
that is , after all , a question the people often ask .    2.8912047121025153
and that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 january 2002 , the date when they will have euros in their pockets .    2.3772456607389056
for the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but , in fact , also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting .    3.4528842059610496
that too is a concern of the people , for , as has rightly been said , this will be a new currency for them , new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used .    3.443363980274303
of course all the citizens of the eu member states will also be faced with the UNK of a currency that is valid over such a wider area , and even beyond europe , as a reserve currency .    3.835802344033282
they will need time to get used to that too .    2.5343878310059504
so it is clearly necessary to ask what the eu is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting .    2.9621013740730904
and that is what we are discussing at this late hour .    3.311162083908523
this really is a subject that is close to the citizen , so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour .    3.1503933957159336
but that cannot be helped .    2.8376653692471066
of course , the european central bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time .    2.8860928801414416
after all , it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting .    3.3386861692427696
as has also been pointed out , in summer 1998 the commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken , such as information , further training - an important area , cooperation between the euro - states and of course even beyond them , and measures under criminal law .    2.7718587338985565
that is what this framework decision is about .    2.80127023554254
mrs cederschiöld , let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the commission and , above all , let me also thank parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time .    3.4239098073429015
i certainly appreciate that .    2.7201086328266304
the framework decision aims to ensure that the member states apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences .    3.1961682012463264
of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and , as was emphasised , what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced .    2.797626335811738
naturally , the commission is also glad that the european parliament ' s prompt decision - and i hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now , so that we can begin to transpose it .    3.7422186616
for the commission has been asked to report , as it will in the first half of next year , on the progress in transposing it in the member states , on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action .    3.897393249932001
it has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law .    3.582058194381823
in that respect we must recognise this innovation , this step , even if , as mr schulz just pointed out , simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step .    2.672273516988107
in reply to the question whether the commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the treaty , the commission believes that the right basis is being applied here .    3.36507091638367
the framework decision will , however , have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future .    3.1945217175425005
the commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with europol .    2.6167435618230965
that proposal will establish a duty to cooperate , and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the european central bank for identification and classification , so that effective measures can then be taken .    2.9050831790757954
on the question of coordinating the various measures , since early 1998 , the commission , followed now by olaf , has been working with experts on the subject from the member states , the european central bank and europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance .    3.158607268738712
as mr karas just pointed out , a few weeks ago the commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro , to which it proposed allocating as much as eur 32 million .    2.8510639921676657
that is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use , a large amount ; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting .    2.4310015669051808
i believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also UNK a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come , because they think the eu is no longer awake at this late hour !    2.495135398141646
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.676484096263824
( the sitting was closed at 11 . 50 p . m . )    1.912263943613366
resumption of the sitting    3.2921308587065043
the minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .    2.0123264391846676
are there any comments ?    2.1658741078678636
( the minutes were approved )    2.0038305127267746
mr president , i should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various members of parliament from all groups .    2.487320340049577
the purpose of the meeting , which was attended by several vice - presidents and quaestors , together with the UNK who designed this building , was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions .    2.5972062609359323
we discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you , mr president , in fact conceals a huge window which , if the curtain were drawn back , would afford a wonderful view over the river .    2.5014713453132362
we were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the UNK during debates .    2.7356108793302245
but what is to prevent us , before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting , opening the UNK and UNK the apparently magnificent view behind you ?    2.6334862874507867
i am more than happy for our house to be UNK by the UNK of our debates but a little real UNK on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss .    2.4953938861297584
i think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the UNK .    2.553346322071396
thank you very much mr onesta , i am grateful for any suggestions that will make our chamber more conducive to human comfort .    2.3868714827283513
i would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being .    2.8671542767687446
in the meantime , i will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter , technically speaking .    3.1837250476711034
ucits    4.491384797960196
.    2.489189446364389
( sv ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is my hope that parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in europe .    2.753090426396619
as a new member of the european parliament , it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter .    3.865421551760483
i should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises ; the president and the bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue ; the commission , and especially the commissioner , for being such worthwhile contacts ; the council ; and also the division responsible for UNK the committee , for its UNK work .    2.6183879405169095
there was a good deal of agreement within the committee , apart from on a matter which , too , i hope it will be possible to solve .    3.6718624703966234
the issue of ucits may appear difficult , technical and a political minefield .    2.546413340821314
allow me , however , to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered , what options there are available , how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings , savers ' demand for security , and the opportunities europe ' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age .    2.635738808504397
it is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors ' need for protection and security .    2.247947691652689
in the course of the 1980s , most markets in europe UNK drastic deregulation . as a result , the national money and UNK markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years .    2.416046962637244
collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank .    2.436581964375289
in my own country , more than 60 per cent of swedes save with a variety of funds .    2.5463955331982318
the security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed .    2.7382058795663835
the capital and securities market has continued to be developed .    2.70105446642202
the current directive on ucits has become UNK and outdated .    2.3632612264112507
new types of funds have been introduced in the various member states which are not permitted to market their units in other member states .    3.0253944945088014
obviously , this UNK competition and innovation and restricts the public ' s range of savings options .    2.3770898193545325
the commission ' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts .    2.9765214016232058
the first concerns the product , that is to say the funds .    2.9481177681875406
the other concerns the collective investment undertakings .    2.827979199986197
the main purpose of the first proposal is to extend the investment opportunities of collective investment undertakings by allowing them to invest in units in other collective investment undertakings , for example units in funds , standardised options and futures contracts and deposits in credit institutions and in certain types of money market instruments .    2.461375057032231
special risk - spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments , involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria .    2.3534233258131225
in addition , the commission ' s proposal puts forward special risk - spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index , a so - called index fund .    2.3884878572568793
to guarantee transparency and prudence , investments in non - harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria , for example a transparency requirement and investor protection , are introduced .    2.197129850265808
in addition , quantitative criteria ( risk exposure ) should be introduced .    2.1932809170359437
moving on now , then , to the point where there is ( or , i hope , was ) a lack of agreement , namely otc derivatives .    3.228000840136085
the commission ' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets ( so - called otc derivatives ) .    2.0588162293428938
the commission ' s proposal takes it as read that otc derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that ucits deal in , but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange - rate risks .    2.60012922023396
in recent years , the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the member states .    2.3784702482298674
it is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments .    2.3660205847684224
the definitions ' standardised futures contracts ' and ' standardised options ' should therefore be combined to form a new definition , ' financial derivative instruments ' , which also covers otc derivatives .    2.2180263758229253
investment in otc derivatives , however , should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced .    2.6288273310898873
they are very important in this case .    3.694384661010547
they must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors .    3.310243002095611
the commission ' s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage ucits , that is to say management companies .    2.4871044304676326
the rules for management companies , for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business , are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations .    2.755656613727847
a crucial point is that rules are proposed for so - called simplified prospectuses .    2.971696838026749
relevant information must be given to UNK unit - holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country .    2.174288098138314
in this regard , too , the committee is prepared to go further than the commission .    3.4161874187953973
a question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies .    3.5928712915551455
there are different views on this .    2.749109017439798
one of the most important things , for me , personally , is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under .    2.880361369292002
during the months that i have been working on this report , one very clear demand has emerged , both from industry and from those who represent the consumer .    2.7851512648645307
the current situation is not good .    3.4343249300053187
both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of europe .    2.6702715746695285
i believe that today ' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors .    3.0282863672162983
i just want to conclude by saying that a number of members of parliament think that the present proposal goes too far , while others think that i am not sufficiently liberal .    3.638749556263093
to them i just want to say , as the english expression goes , ' you can ' t have it all . '    2.8181243782346272
mr president , at the outset i wish to place on the official record of the house my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by mr schmidt , our rapporteur .    2.88255033145558
i was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous parliament .    2.728101053566012
we failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter .    2.726193180076061
in a short space of time mr schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within parliament . i thank him for that .    2.3718446081649622
as the draftsperson for the opinion of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , i also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the legal affairs committee and the economic affairs committee for their cooperation on this matter .    2.619540477751504
there is little disagreement amongst members with regard to the first proposal .    2.8713074897359325
it puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities .    2.925600857890933
however , it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern .    4.177843781056441
i have a number of ideas which should be put across .    3.757950933730601
firstly , the idea of an eu passport for management companies is to be welcomed ; and the home - state approval rule is also to be welcomed .    2.7368607026569016
however , instead of imposing a new regime , we could have used the investment services directive as the UNK for this regime .    2.7247787157518313
it seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity .    2.3281069241037335
many members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries ' national interests rather than improving the overall system for europe .    2.607879623240861
we will have to revisit this issue again in the near future .    2.8509721817742535
i call on members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put europe on a sound footing for the short term , if not for the long term .    2.7676696986964333
mr president , i must firstly thank the rapporteur , mr schmidt , my colleague , mr goebbels , and mrs villiers and mrs lulling from my group . despite their differing opinions on some points , they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner .    2.4723943127022228
as indicated by the rapporteur , we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this parliament .    4.0599722045648425
collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens , without any specialist knowledge , have invested their life savings .    2.085216333618041
this is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation , albeit in a prudent manner .    2.4198045870678677
i say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution .    2.4684497041698905
however , the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political , social and personal problem with UNK consequences .    2.4081190642225074
there is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings .    2.666270968315827
this basic principle of liberalisation , increased competition and greater investment opportunities , together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve , has determined and inspired my group ' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen .    2.4997550763066827
firstly , there is the problem of investment in non - harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive .    2.8184670141527284
it is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion , the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments , those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high - risk funds .    2.1504360322548783
it would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments .    2.3182305232641625
secondly , the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions , both within my group and between the groups .    3.029885712713799
we have achieved a compromise solution .    2.750986779951989
everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high - risk products .    2.4186016182383123
it is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market , namely the famous otc derivatives .    2.0868287193689885
we have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this , or so we believe , which i welcome .    2.825233024349664
as this issue will be returning to this house at some stage , i must highlight the working method used between the commission and this parliament .    3.04661324533444
the texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this house . this was because they were substantially amended during the finnish presidency .    2.567544998872646
we are therefore faced with two options . we can either return the proposals to the commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process .    2.5774556506335107
this second option has won the day and i am pleased about this . however , in the future i hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive .    3.443392516579583
mr president , the socialist group supports the commission ' s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services .    3.1173223110628427
obviously , in the wake of the introduction of the euro , we need to create an integrated european financial market which is similar to the american and japanese markets .    3.1666759782870404
the debates on ucits gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee .    2.6878376841602396
i should like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr olle schmidt , and also mr garcía - margallo y marfil , for their constructive approach .    2.341746310836655
the socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economies and to the allocation of resources .    3.1861184060827275
but the world of international finance is a dangerous one .    2.902878425560777
there is at present a UNK of cash looking for a home .    3.1084740513414895
in 1999 , the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over - stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions , pushing up the prices of long - term financial and real assets .    2.517250931034106
and as international financial activity speeds up , the risks increase .    2.3496655105255315
you do not need a nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets , which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25 % is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term .    2.414456777428699
the legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the european financial markets .    2.8529334115180793
the legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses .    2.305601594435008
there is no freedom without rules .    2.554975164849198
we have done away with so - called master - feeder structures .    2.597712366296037
these feeder funds exist in the united states , which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system .    3.173656156419701
the european market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems .    2.2535289436103336
the socialists , like the commission , question the UNK of allowing investment funds to invest in so - called over - the - counter derivatives , i . e . products negotiated between professionals by private contract .    3.0720332690776724
as these transactions are generally not subject to UNK control , the risks are all the more obvious .    2.604181969962492
the socialist group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors .    2.590002365154783
by adopting these amendments , parliament will allow recourse to otc derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors .    2.205906057798631
mr president , there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance .    2.9379460348589337
this principle should not only guide the public sector , it should also guide the private sector , especially financial undertakings .    2.991295384529077
mr president , our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UNK is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers , which is why i want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today .    2.787848868334234
i firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure , safer , higher returns .    2.4049642846738717
despite their image of danger , derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance .    2.157199347662821
a contract that , for example , pays a substantial sum if , say , the nasdaq or the cac 40 share index falls , causes an extra payment by the investor if the nasdaq or the cac 40 share index rises .    2.005785248245835
is this speculative ?    2.9239484081125946
not at all .    3.2609564929726482
imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident : they have good management , good prospects and they are good investments .    2.2654135511917164
then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse , as it did in 1987 .    2.9740996843861485
you have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash , but that would be to waste your research into the winners .    2.5998321461893523
it would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall .    1.9187259344312808
the solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the nasdaq or cac 40 falls .    2.1763650218305806
but even with a tailor - made derivative or otc derivative which would be cheaper , perhaps UNK you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index , you would still have the portfolio and the shares , but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse .    2.021003077759657
in exchange , you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets .    2.6032971060652974
in this case , which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers , you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk .    2.512302668910774
that is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund .    2.340583573629961
history demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light - handed approach to regulation .    2.1353661469066183
heavy - UNK - a UNK of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers .    2.3342487732730706
pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest , as required by of our government bonds , made returns of 5 . 2 % a year , barely half the 9 . 5 % annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996 .    1.9515784406968057
these are of course the returns after UNK all losses .    2.700380854166096
do not UNK a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off .    2.6227059667412704
this is what we should be concerned about here today .    3.0970682107399052
mr president , the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in europe , including the most sophisticated forms of investment .    2.765080988878718
we do not , in principle , oppose this industry .    3.106848811898597
however , unlike mr UNK huhne , we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may , in time , provoke the same type of crisis .    2.03330028322506
but we make no UNK about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole .    3.218067301059485
we shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised .    2.5158064761758276
for years certain countries , including great britain , have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens .    2.4241554886451078
they even reject the strict minimum , i . e . the monti package proposed by the commission in brussels .    2.680587680473565
this attitude is turning europe into a machine which UNK investment income from tax and shifts the whole tax burden to commercial income , with all the social and even moral consequences which that implies .    2.0956775120487103
we must put an end to this .    2.662177542481875
by blocking the demands of the financial industry , the european parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall .    3.480530108273342
mr president , the UNK directive introduced a sort of european visa for certain types of ucits which could be marketed throughout the union .    2.5303560755231365
since then , the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve ; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation , they have UNK UNK and without restraint .    2.3369029310961102
this brings us to the two proposals for directives .    2.9239649125229863
the second proposal , on which the report is excellent , does not require any particular comment .    3.02974243680178
it aims to strengthen consumer protection and security .    2.7844998922150164
it is a step in the right direction , even if one wonders why in heaven , with what right and with what respect for our citizens , we are further UNK the monopoly of the english language in all documents distributed throughout europe .    2.4341051726735987
that is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled ; it favours all the languages of the community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it .    2.9018674038642764
the same cannot be said of the first proposal .    2.8959891287668773
we might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation .    2.87165147931702
however , we are unable to agree to the text of the report , although i welcome the work carried out by mr schmidt , for several reasons .    3.511394783805958
first , it UNK too far towards products based on UNK which have no bearing on the real economy ; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which mr UNK referred to just now .    2.2716630414637398
secondly , like him , i think that we should not promote excessive concentration in funds which , in the final analysis , will prove to be a trojan horse for american pension funds .    2.933831233062364
we shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the member states to increase to 35 % .    2.752399215827747
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.799445241956104
mr president , this is a vital issue for europe .    2.8444139815154186
a europe that faces an UNK pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of europe can obtain on their savings .    2.2182907622858075
i welcome many of the developments which mr schmidt ' s report brings us .    2.9234767428961645
they are a safe product , traded cross - border .    2.761705011050016
but it is time for the legislation to be updated .    3.3555098162023356
mr schmidt has done an excellent job here .    2.448863588837442
it is no secret that i would have much preferred mr schmidt ' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through parliament .    2.80370788400638
but i appeal to this house to take a balanced and common - sense approach on this issue .    3.0223663265831457
the radical step taken by this report is to allow ucits to use over - the - counter derivatives .    2.4450448899492185
i appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by ucits .    2.831239961140094
we are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation . we are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary europeans .    2.969685835207359
mr schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of parliament for over - the - counter derivatives .    2.6605008252074547
we must not be afraid to go forward , to react to changes in the market .    2.802996360363
yes , we need to continue to ensure that ucits provide a balanced and protected product for consumers .    3.493704654912079
the report gives very adequate protection for consumers .    2.546812636652339
but a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over - the - counter derivatives .    2.822815149408495
i feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts , which can only help individual people around europe obtain a high return on their savings .    2.2795834773889383
i salute mr schmidt .    2.7518662613466494
thank you very much mr UNK .    2.3295850908145384
ladies and gentlemen , i have an update for you on the curtain and window situation .    2.5471444640172263
if we open this curtain , then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away .    2.5699950525847557
we will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting . however , i will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies .    3.177063385067663
mr president , the ucits directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 october 1989 , mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors .    2.271227418846568
the directive and the reputation which ucits enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the european union fivefold .    2.4151708039743873
there has been a strong increase in cross - border marketing of investments within the european union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world .    2.9317295715803864
however , the directive is ten years old and , now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available , it is somewhat outdated .    2.942582815032757
i share some of the concerns expressed here , especially by mr garcía - margallo y marfil , but this face - lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index , and which are therefore managed either UNK or not at all , and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively - managed fund were treated in the same way , if only to allow medium - sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market .    2.443813933788396
in addition , investors often have better protection with an actively - managed fund .    2.026224463853289
my amendment no 47 is therefore a warning for UNK .    2.789203957067188
as far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15 % is concerned , i would like to stress that , apart from the fact that this limit is too low , the text does not define the concept of a group . this concept does not exist under european law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice .    2.8614208229030407
i shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment .    2.9106021435063303
to conclude , mr president , allow me to remind the house that the directive needs a UNK which will make ucits even more attractive , but it does not need to be UNK into a european UNK which will UNK the life out of it .    3.2853699006497856
- ( de ) mr president , the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper european financial area , which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency , but also to increase competition .    2.710054173722129
at the same time , it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings , particularly those we are concerned with today .    2.763562595774783
at the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as ucits with a total value of in excess of eur 2 billion , thereby accounting for roughly 75 % of all funds assets .    2.083335408408484
hence the commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives , and i must say that i actually have every confidence in the commission ' s proposal .    2.9671763739255956
we are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds , and how difficult it is to construct the european passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even - UNK across the board .    2.3933141504849114
this therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products .    2.8203906033101296
it is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and i think it is very important for this to be reflected in the commission ' s proposal and that of the european parliament , as well as in the compromise motions .    3.7713103617263046
however , i do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the otc derivatives , and i also think that as a european parliament it is our duty to inform and UNK again and again on consumers - who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long - term security , and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings - that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection .    2.9005747722653425
why do we not take our UNK from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive , article 11 for example , which relates to good practice ?    2.8165577152519368
i therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and i think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund ' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile .    2.8070940690675923
mr president , commissioner , the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions .    2.2942142569319683
the preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the european investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units .    2.2813093050570994
the greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations , the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market .    2.4083362522978584
and the more consumers invest , the UNK the prospects will be in the european business money markets .    3.4626566069911484
it is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital - based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based , and , thus , opportunities for growth and investment will also improve .    2.4123002519227557
whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via ucits is not relevant here .    2.208956187946314
although in the committee on economic and monetary affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment , the debate we had was not the easiest one .    2.8687392586127394
for me personally at least , difficulties were caused by the directive ' s technical division into two different proposals , which certainly did not make it easier to UNK oneself with this very difficult technical subject .    2.493421793234246
however , i would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals .    3.022038446063614
firstly , i am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments .    2.8800568034627743
as regards derivatives , i consider the position adopted by the committee justified - unlike mrs randzio - plath , for example .    2.822580488606367
the directive should not treat over - the - counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many member states and were also used before .    2.63569814205012
with regard to article UNK of the other proposal for a directive , the so - called article on delegation , i think the commission ' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee , so i would support some of mrs villiers ' amendments to this point .    3.219918234019234
mr president , i see two problems with this morning ' s debate .    2.3082725744022543
firstly , when i came to this parliament many years ago i was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a liberal .    2.5504332270127983
now i have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the luxembourg members are in the chamber at one time - and they are .    2.822738854604645
firstly , i welcome proposal no 1 .    3.023073105708531
it UNK things and brings things up to date .    2.487106395198489
i think many of the british members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report .    3.5875951414087885
we support the schmidt report on proposal no 1 , but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks .    2.95486594277489
we believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward .    2.846717641717717
it is difficult to understand , and we think the commission would be well advised to look at it again .    3.377699383867157
if further regulation is needed , we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive .    2.709509858429111
in particular , we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether .    2.4722732717082616
we ask the commission to look again at these proposals .    3.0782306680438176
finally , we would urge members to vote in particular against amendment no 41 on capital requirements , because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry .    3.0286197020250425
the important thing is for money to generate more money .    2.386701130443429
this is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars , like UNK ' s UNK UNK , who has dollar signs for eyes , except in this case the symbol is that of the euro .    2.8947987712539356
in this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in UNK .    2.870467099709644
for example , my brother - in - law , who lives in rome , started drawing his pension a year ago and every day since - from seven in the morning when he UNK until midnight - he has checked the tv screen to see how the pensions funds and the securities in which he has invested are performing .    2.06264514529389
pensioners will , in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal .    3.091681001023226
indeed , whilst the young are UNK , the elderly have accumulated money and , since they are keen to turn it to good advantage , harbour great hopes for this directive .    2.5191590551453813
if national governments had in their hearts - as the european union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life , the pensions time bomb would already have been UNK .    2.5187517022554218
. ( nl ) mr president , could i first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur , mr olle schmidt , and the members of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , which has principal authority , as well as the rapporteur , mr UNK crowley and the members of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , whom i would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the UNK and extension of the proposals .    3.296477408049433
since the approval of directive 85 / 611 , the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules .    2.53393776427274
the aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors , which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro .    3.207240934071176
since the average european family puts its savings in investment funds , the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and i would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk - spreading are concerned .    2.4444327494654923
the first proposal UNK the number of instruments in which an ' undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities ' ( ucits ) can invest .    2.4562927847681872
as already remarked in this session , ucits are key players within the modern capital markets .    2.0299075848787496
their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets , in which the principle of risk - spreading is taken into consideration , protected by appropriate supervision .    2.8521668505002276
since diverse types of investment are permitted , private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques .    2.2325093863410004
the second proposal UNK the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the eu capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector .    2.6607359962947945
by allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross - border basis , these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the treaty of rome , which they have been denied for all these years .    2.996932499010539
the commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the committee on economic and monetary affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas .    2.747714772086962
the commission will adopt amendments nos - and i am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 13 , 19 and 21 for the first proposal , and 23 , 28 and 32 for the second proposal , since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements .    2.710185503512585
i also value the ideas put forward in amendments nos 1 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 18 and 20 , although the wording needs to be adapted .    2.6640918526957447
i also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in amendments nos 17 , 36 and 45 .    2.0349965478000835
i can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of amendment no 47 .    2.9142704450355312
all the amendments i have listed so far pertain to the first proposal .    2.548865321502089
as far as the second proposal is concerned , the ideas of amendments nos 24 , 25 , 29 , 30 , 41 and some parts of 27 , which contain sensible suggestions , can be adopted , again formulated appropriately .    2.3269074080937093
the commission has suggested adopting the content of these , with certain changes in the wording .    2.869449207826086
moreover , i have taken note of the request made by the committee on economic and monetary affairs to UNK the entire text , once it has been approved - amendment no 7 of the first proposal and amendment no 22 of the second proposal .    3.3444964278519045
the commission is in favour of UNK and will , in the foreseeable future , once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative , concentrate its efforts on drafting a UNK version .    3.2113527574914267
however , i cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands .    2.5387197153881234
the commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the committee on economic and monetary affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal .    3.1529522327852013
this is why the commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal :    3.635178599296043
amendment no 8 because the proposed , general reference to assets ' covered by this directive ' , instead of the more precise reference to assets ' mentioned in article 19 of this directive ' , hinders implementation .    2.3505754786416824
this amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the member states , which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive .    2.5328396567528064
amendment no 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms .    2.0835737406937804
neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions .    1.9343783281229496
we cannot , therefore , adopt the proposed amendment for this reason .    3.187511853770602
amendment no 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive .    2.627092681763593
i therefore cannot see any reason why article 22 , paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason .    2.1955676567640374
amendment no 44 cannot be accepted because , if it is prescribed that non - harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been ' imposed by the directive ' concerning lending , borrowing , selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian , this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds , for example swiss funds , would be eligible for investment .    2.6174019582830512
this goes against the commission ' s intention to widen the scope of investments , and the wording thereof could contravene UNK agreements .    3.187731249416009
amendment no 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of article UNK are concerned , because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of article 22 , especially when the ucits are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses , as discussed in the council .    2.7614517538202694
the key issue regarding the first proposal , however , is parliament ' s amendment which allows the use of over - the - counter instruments for general investment purposes .    3.0496700279595816
the commission points out that , according to the national legislation of some member states , the use of otc derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised .    3.0714381726977447
however , the commission will be suspending its position , given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments .    2.6591970388500767
i believe that otc instruments could lead to problems , because they are not UNK , the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks .    2.8473711657710745
it seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non - harmonised funds or deposits and , at the same time , freely to allow investments in clearly more risky otc instruments .    2.184673415597935
by rejecting the rapporteur ' s amendment no 39 , the committee on economic and monetary affairs has aligned itself with the council .    2.685776163846255
the upshot of this amendment by parliament would be that funds are allowed , in theory , to invest in otc instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market .    2.2841245461130066
in practice , access to other eu markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in otc instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against otc investments . this would contravene the fact that eu legislation applies to all funds which invest in otc instruments .    2.0956076172399776
given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in otc instruments , the commission cannot accept amendments nos 12 , 15 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 43 , 46 and 48 and parts of amendments nos 17 , 36 and 45 which pertain to otc instruments .    2.3874165231451783
as far as the second proposal is concerned , i already mentioned that the commission will take into consideration many amendments .    3.1317304640005283
despite this , there are some amendments which the commission cannot adopt : amendment no 26 , which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start ; parts of amendment no 27 , especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted , the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision - taking of member states concerning delegation is repealed ; amendment no 31 because the commission is of the opinion that the application of article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in ucits .    2.4576706834786286
the application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities , better known as isd , is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion .    2.748557449603704
amendment no 33 is ambiguous regarding ' the language ' of the guest member state , especially when there are various official languages , and it is questionable what will be gained from translations in two other languages .    2.5239803245394166
amendment no 34 is unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension funds can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activities .    2.4049737582508897
i think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility , provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds , but may only carry out part of the management per delegation .    2.389725056068679
amendment no 35 cannot be accepted because legally , it cannot UNK any authority .    2.351812312264293
management companies which are denied access to a member state would need to re - incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another member state .    2.9731328466924936
i would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few members this morning and , mr president , with your permission , i will do this in english .    2.830134917327711
first of all , regarding the remarks of mr crowley , who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure isd approach ; the objections of the commission to that proposal would be the following : such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non - consistent sets of rules ; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest .    2.26099423130332
for example , a management company might be doing UNK business and , if not able to sell , it would put the securities in the fund it would manage , or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did UNK business .    2.252667844896363
furthermore the proposal put forward by mr crowley would require a change of the isd which at present - as i am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business .    2.5385201596801323
lastly , his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render isd activities .    2.50832948625906
as regards the question put by mr huhne , his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations .    2.062679899624678
but hedging operations are already allowed in the existing article 21 ( 1 ) of directive 611 / 85 on ucits .    2.129365853042654
so what mr huhne wants is already possible .    2.344810556787411
a question has been put by mrs villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management .    2.3924827881909088
that is also something which is allowed under present legislation . i refer to the same article 21 i referred to in relation to mr huhne ' s question .    3.2110029271778515
in her question mrs kauppi asks why the commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals . the reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product , while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider , and on prospectuses for ucits .    2.8593683990417946
the separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the council .    2.668953821924787
the commission has not only to listen to parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but , as is well - known , must also deal with the council .    3.466559340038929
that is the reason why the commission has put forward these two separate proposals .    3.234887700821389
lastly , mr balfe has complained that there are , in his opinion , too many limits in the whole proposal the commission has put forward .    3.11740577815891
it seems to us that these limits are justified : firstly , by the need to diversify investments ; secondly , because of the UNK to the need to UNK investment at any time ; thirdly , in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds .    3.669920211387367
these are the reasons why the commission believes , because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field , that these various limits are necessary .    3.176675639469983
the vote will take place at 12 noon .    2.136842507139407
mutual assistance in criminal matters between the member states    3.5158500215551207
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0019 / 2000 ) by mr di pietro on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms , and rights , justice and home affairs on the draft council act establishing the convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the member states of the european union .    2.0475166257914466
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in letters dated 3 august 1999 and 3 december 1999 , the council called on the european parliament , pursuant to article 39 of the treaty , to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the member states aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters .    2.79142777414996
it is thus , as you can see , a very important draft , that will effectively serve to provide the member states of the union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance .    3.282650685258335
in actual fact , there are still certain differences of opinion within the council over the type of convention , and over certain provisions contained therein .    2.846035632928908
some of these differences have already been UNK out , but others persist .    3.0827459923439298
the spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary , but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime , which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights .    2.4505088875764227
it is for this reason that , despite the many omissions in the text , the provisions set out therein could - and i say could , mr president - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens .    2.9941159847187397
the commission has proposed various amendments to this end , all of which aim to systematically restructure the council proposal by suggesting a series of technical adjustments that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regards the amendments proposed .    2.470084664503295
the amendments can be UNK as follows : they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence , introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible , and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications , an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various member states of the union .    2.572745523625254
the proposal , as formulated by the council and subsequently amended by the commission , provides for a convention based on three UNK : the first lays down guidelines for ensuring the consistency of procedures and formalities for letters UNK ; the second lists a whole series of specific requests for mutual assistance and defines the formalities and procedures which must be followed in relation to these specific types of mutual assistance ; the third and last provides for and UNK the procedures via which telephone conversations conducted by citizens in a state other than the one instigating proceedings can and must be UNK .    2.3915050047647877
mr president , international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross - border crime and crimes which are committed in one state , but the evidence for which is to be found in another .    2.9468813878720432
it is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other , even more delicate issues into account : the whole issue of double jeopardy , that of UNK , and that of the credibility of one member state of the union in respect of the judicial authorities of other member states of the union .    3.0896650874252707
these are thus extremely important questions , which we hope that the council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion .    3.0332042809096627
as regards other aspects of this subject , mr president , i would refer you to my written report .    3.0760456995915195
i should like to draw attention to the fact that the council is not present today .    3.1922356994305616
by contrast , i welcome the attentive presence of commissioner vitorino , as has consistently been the case since his appointment . this leads me to another point .    2.6022866729257523
this house has only prepared one report on this convention . it was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed .    2.737631104160473
i condemn this , as well as the council ' s absence .    3.6981428601536055
these are serious matters on which this house must act .    2.6475933781435983
we are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance .    2.036537434990322
this is why this report is so important .    2.9239908785274396
it represents a step towards the area of freedom , security and , particularly , justice to which we all aspire .    3.1740569945730552
it is also an important step towards european natural justice . this will be built on mutual confidence between the member states and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the european people in any european court .    3.179565563352928
it will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular .    2.95639635135937
mr president , as the rapporteur said , this house has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the convention .    2.870088373338059
on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party , i have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible .    2.8177460333171616
the regulation of phone tapping in the council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate .    2.60812045806883
yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field . in fact , we are aware that these are already happening widely .    2.9675496206270098
the other point which i must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video UNK with regard to accused persons .    3.2720064945699336
again on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party , i have asked the council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue , which is frankly unsatisfactory .    3.532874860460063
apart from a few exceptions , the members of the group of the european people ' s party will vote in favour of the committee ' s amendments , and of course our own .    3.352703294834493
mr president , it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system , for the europe that we want to build , which comprises administrative law , civil law , both substantive and procedural , and criminal law , both substantive and procedural .    2.695083845775822
the convention on mutual assistance and criminal matters , which we are examining today , is but a UNK in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of europe , which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms .    3.3057895582736103
thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights , principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation : i am thinking of fair trials , and more particularly of the rights of the defence , of the impartiality and integrity of judges , of the length of legal proceedings , for which my country , italy , unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down , of the cases pending before the european court of human rights .    2.781679919493572
restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law .    3.014002439365216
the report that the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula , taking up many of the amendments we have presented , still leaves room for a certain confusion , in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated .    2.8284949588357082
the news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue : we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and UNK than the dark scenes UNK by UNK .    2.40195006022896
mr schulz should be aware of this .    2.971177307969283
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i fully understand the frustration of mr di pietro who , in a short space of time , has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today .    2.742450720383572
crime in the european union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step - by - step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs .    2.7565590423268422
the european parliament is certainly not to blame for this .    3.1953548713046667
it is the governments of the member states who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree .    2.9067673365551574
as a result , the european parliament is faced with an almost impossible task .    3.0134304624578836
one has to content oneself with the idea that all means , however slight , must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance .    2.9342554221671375
by way of paradox , i could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report , for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken , the more the world of crime will UNK and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious .    2.7654189260677318
i would therefore make an urgent appeal to the council of ministers to finally face reality , that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law .    2.857366844050742
the goal is , after all , to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates , in the first place , but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights .    2.8267633977240694
if not , we will be fighting a running battle .    2.936618250329228
i therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the eu member states in the first instance .    3.7713023604378875
in my opinion , this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all member states .    2.803778321442034
as long as this harmonisation has not been achieved , however , we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance .    3.841266595853476
to this end , i had submitted an amendment stipulating that legal assistance can only be granted in the event of criminal prosecution instituted by the authorities based on facts which are punishable according to the national law of the UNK party and the member state petitioned .    2.942876378887334
the content of my amendment is , in fact , echoed in amendment no 43 , which also stipulates this condition of accrual .    2.730608795019177
this condition of accrual is essential since , in my opinion , the principle of UNK UNK sine UNK , legality in criminal law , must be observed .    3.1255348159330345
as such , any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned member state contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned member state .    2.2833456454541357
hence , it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted .    3.2907473871899837
finally , i would like to reiterate that mr di pietro has , in my opinion , delivered sterling work by submitting a report which , within the limitations , offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms .    2.4888945714260724
if , however , we would like to give european citizens a greater sense of security , we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation .    3.6505268590526807
mr president , my group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day - to - day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs .    2.8799576020369884
the present proposal is complex , because it deals with agreements between member states but has far - reaching consequences for the citizen - government relationship .    2.7703159073791905
in the words of rapporteur mr di pietro , the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings .    2.5670271533292413
thanks to the agreement , it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests , whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different member states .    2.9790275529136774
the chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court .    2.859071303712094
additional measures are hence required , such as the obligation on the part of criminal UNK to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used .    2.4689991913921707
the fact that the council ' s proposal UNK roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my group .    3.3780651882035553
there are certainly no restrictions in its scope .    2.3927556966011174
as such , the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime .    2.499347181940173
in fact , it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law .    3.4043690360827563
it is , therefore , conceivable that the european union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will UNK in the dust .    3.3727595309230587
mr president , the convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned .    2.4307936112362034
it pertains , among other things , to notifications , information exchanges , the temporary transfer of detainees , the UNK of property , UNK via video conferences , investigative activities and ' undercover ' activities , and the interception of telephone calls .    2.33742548890391
this is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached , and it should immediately be said that if any amendments , such as amendments nos 32 or 81 , or the revised amendments nos 70 or 71 , were to be passed , the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped , and we would vote against it .    2.7174201873894654
i hope that the common sense of our fellow meps in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments .    2.4034192081223353
the fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this parliament .    2.921404081305533
as commissioner vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches , the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules , which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner , with this disparate agenda , with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation .    2.9535320323616614
what is , on the other hand , absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the community , and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible , and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement .    3.0002393205067106
my thoughts turn to what may become of this community , of these conventions and judicial relations if , for example , a fascist country such as turkey became a member of the union . it would truly UNK me .    2.7471669677343606
we need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules , especially procedural ones , which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the community .    2.3429520134241564
it is clear that this is primarily an issue for the igc and one that addresses an aspiration to which this parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the council and the commission .    2.8007700225028156
i believe that this first half of the year , in which we have a commissioner from portugal and portuguese presidency of the council , provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration .    3.1089593456926834
it is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting amendments nos 78 and 79 , which already UNK a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences .    2.518395666217389
on the one hand , we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote , precisely so that this convention - which , i repeat , already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning , while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum community law .    2.5379727589243766
mr president , confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level , the member states must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible .    2.4305506192564863
indeed , they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national UNK in the field of justice , over which member states have sovereign powers , and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights .    2.406233944797893
we must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the council which , as the rapporteur himself has underlined , now claims , after years of discussion , to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months .    2.89662032897231
furthermore - and i agree with the assessment made by mr di pietro - the council ' s text would appear to be UNK with contradictions , inconsistent UNK and omissions .    3.282514680522389
it is clear that the justice sector , more than any other , cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner .    2.428423776863669
it is the opinion of our group that even the report , considered as a whole , would be the subject of much debate , notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties .    2.995665384884525
the report contains arguments that are too disparate , which do not link together smoothly , and everything thus hinges on approximations .    2.157541944187084
we will , in conclusion , vote against this report , while stressing that the europe to which we aspire is a europe of rights and guarantees : rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion , as well as very serious examination .    2.7365903526702917
we must first establish general rules and institutional certainties . only then will we be able to institute actual conventions .    2.367782901681456
mr president , on behalf of the members of parliament on the bonino list , i intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the committee on civil liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf . it is a vote against this report , or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based .    3.0647731189625853
i would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work . he listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage , and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence , both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of european mutual assistance .    2.7839713052653887
the committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented , and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence .    2.476077409902279
this UNK us to maintain that the european parliament would have done sterling work in guaranteeing that civil rights and freedoms were safeguarded , if this were a UNK parliament and if we were , as part of this procedure , in fact co - legislators - which we are not .    3.3084908242711726
this is the problem , and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the council , which is one we find completely unsatisfactory .    3.9211044782429405
this is a task that has lasted three years , and on which we have been consulted , so to speak , as a matter of course , when this issue , as has already been stressed , comprises highly important formal and substantive facets , which called for a range of assessments , consultations , concerted actions and codecisions .    2.841390080997381
it would seem to us that the council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions , the rights of the defence , the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally UNK to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly .    2.8251619862489155
we should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention , and then requested another : the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it , even if we hope that the amendments , which nevertheless improve the text , can be incorporated by the council - we doubt that they will be , but hope all the same that they are .    3.5143540549562355
i agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work , which has been carried out under difficult conditions .    3.565751798097082
the danish members of the group cannot vote in favour of the proposal but will , on the contrary , be supporting a number of amendments , especially those tabled by the greens .    3.5305113837760795
there are two reasons why we are saying no .    2.9237621586464915
firstly , these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and , to my mind , the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty , which have not been fully realised . this is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support .    3.0373345998733643
we would warn against that trend . we have this afsj mantra - area of freedom , security and justice - the full UNK of which lies in its establishment of eu systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character .    2.017055703564884
mr president , i too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom , security and justice which europe will hopefully one day become .    2.602274986159081
it is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons , in which there are no frontiers to crime , but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime .    2.71936812050753
a small step - i say - but nonetheless a welcome one , for which the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the member states and in the union itself , even if these are not yet enshrined in a european union charter of rights , which we hope will soon come into being : just restrictions and guarantees because , unfortunately , existing rights are , in practice , not always respected by every public authority in every member state .    2.79585810056161
certain isolated passages in the commission ' s proposal perhaps UNK on the side of caution , as is the case when it is maintained that the UNK accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another member state of the union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries .    3.003010560073351
i personally find it unacceptable , for example , for mr pinochet to be given the option to move to spain for a confrontation .    2.7300759284644647
or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link .    2.094749257693181
these are nevertheless minor flaws , which the rapporteur did not want and which - i hope - will be remedied when this chamber comes to vote .    2.484282372145548
the rapporteur has made laudable efforts , which should not go UNK and for which i would like to thank him .    3.1699346142540574
the overall result is remarkable and i hope that the council will fully take it into account .    2.935208588258539
there is , as has already been said , one point still to resolved , which is also the most delicate one : it concerns article 18 of the convention , which relates to the interception of communications originating in one member state , but which are directly performed by another member state , without the assistance being requested of the state in which the interception is being carried out , something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology .    3.1881734358667506
this is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse .    2.2160020404799785
it could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing , but to the commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring .    2.4023020532162476
it thus merits further reflection which , at a time in which the ambivalent reports on echelon are UNK UNK of big brother , should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used , on the one hand , to safeguard the rights of the individual , and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime .    2.70947971538181
the objective is thus to achieve , as closely as possible , a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual : an objective which now specifically applies not only to the member states , but also to the union , which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom , justice and security .    3.1084573811693605
this is a distant goal , but is one that can be attained in stages .    2.5577631156374405
the most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the member states , but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward , as it is a step in the right direction .    3.062191593753979
mr president , first of all i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement .    2.278320533732003
it points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal .    3.0058415582667486
legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters .    2.776180346348194
because of shoddy drafting the convention can be interpreted very widely , and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the european convention on human rights .    2.453032505200845
article 18 allows interception in another member state without its involvement .    2.422857868903165
not only should this be deleted , the whole interception title should be scrapped .    2.52428261804436
an initiative of the fbi drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation .    2.9551072984299656
now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception , and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at .    3.5221164492284527
the requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers , that is , telephones , mobile UNK , internet , etc . ; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting , this is open to abuse . i would also like to ask : given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception , does this include parliament ' s in - house service ?    2.599600076455238
are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very , very shoddy grounds ?    2.44244042710676
furthermore , in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences .    3.358587417146105
this leaves it wide open to abuse .    2.3722619292016742
again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof , something which is recognised in international , fundamental law , the UNK of UNK is essential .    3.09031157225363
that is not guaranteed .    2.8790294889626655
this issue is extremely serious .    2.953957196758092
we are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout europe which are extremely concerned about these developments .    2.529676255855581
mr president , i am neither a member of the legal affairs committee nor a lawyer , but like almost all of us , i understand the need for this single economic area of europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom , security and justice .    2.6631468225100607
in that sense , the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important .    3.1084693549132316
what did i understand on reading the related texts ?    2.398891011129882
that it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the council .    3.2332189911384552
the many contradictions and conflicting views over what europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations .    2.0910101163308905
for example , the situation proposed by article 18 , to which many speakers have drawn attention , where each country , each large country if you will , each country with the technical ability , can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country ' s approval .    2.2652192409535568
in my opinion , the legal affairs committee and the rapporteur mr di pietro have produced some very interesting work .    2.4339318888164554
it is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by mr di pietro could not be conveyed in the UNK five minutes he had here today .    2.5303807951058195
nevertheless , it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries , UNK and citizens , a path which i think must be pursued much more completely and much more UNK .    3.1015710671943966
i should like , however , to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law .    3.07077682370324
a child , a student or a UNK who UNK UNK in one country is dealt with in an educational way , while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons .    2.28492890782486
how can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis ?    2.5493073080639705
for that reason , in conclusion , i believe we should do something , particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws , not those relating to organised criminal activity , but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena .    2.8420104266673736
on behalf of the tdi group , i should like to take the opportunity afforded by judge di pietro ' s report on mutual assistance in criminal matters to refer to a case which is a tragic illustration of the way crime is eroding security in europe .    2.8025080623333536
on 14 december 1999 , a five year - old UNK called UNK was found in a UNK - car on the calais - UNK train , crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother .    2.155596065495146
UNK UNK , who had probably been raped , was found with her throat cut and covered in stab UNK in the UNK on the train .    2.786053099347598
the presumed killer , UNK UNK rezala , is also strongly suspected of having murdered the british student isabel peake , who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents , and another young woman , UNK UNK , who was found dead in UNK under a pile of coal in the building where he lived .    2.090186165740062
rezala should never have been in france . he arrived from algeria at a time when , according to the authorities , immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come .    2.6684430929386767
he should never have UNK in france , having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences , which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country .    2.490318859219208
he should never have been free because 14 charges of theft , violence and rape had been brought against him , one of which was for the rape of a minor .    2.05273385206774
he should never have arrived in spain , where he UNK a woman at UNK and yet was immediately released by the spanish authorities .    2.352891277185488
today , thanks to the complex networks of sexual UNK , he is in portugal .    2.698273458529307
portugal refuses to UNK him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in france than that provided for in the portuguese penal code .    2.485754630721955
i should like to ask the portuguese minister , the president - in - office of the council , to put a stop to this scandal at once .    2.4582374047994398
i should like to ask the house to wake up , at long last , to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment , not the UNK , bears full responsibility .    3.1553478572235587
mr president , this agreement deals with a sensitive issue : cooperation in the field of criminal law .    2.7475449038362267
it is therefore understandable that the council finds it difficult to agree .    2.7933063341381406
successful application of this agreement by the member states requires unanimity within the council .    3.364525108396027
only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice .    2.266610913611905
this , however , does not mean that the council can work on this anonymously .    4.039248879124578
quite the reverse , in fact .    2.764762959371374
the wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test .    2.8945461237286763
careful parliamentary scrutiny by the european parliament but , above all , by the national parliaments , is therefore of key importance .    3.662828848066099
mr di pietro ' s proposal to UNK the current article 18 regarding UNK telecommunications , amongst other things , is understandable , although very strict .    2.750857200323306
the text of article 18 is ambiguous : he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a member state in another member state without the latter ' s prior authorisation .    2.3070064552684837
in this way , member states would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the state where interception occurs and the citizens within that state .    2.586224788555401
proposed additions , such as repeated references to the echr , the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of member states to implement the echr , add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement .    2.9194031259749225
i am aware of the problems but i think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text .    3.4708042226459286
the dutch members of the group for a europe of democracies and diversities will , however , despite hesitation , not withhold their support for the di pietro report in the final vote .    2.9710777596034537
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation .    2.7317361125355686
this clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much - discussed european citizenship .    2.2595178061684797
pursuant to article 29 of the eu treaty , the union ' s objective is ' to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom , security and justice by developing common action among the member states in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia ' .    2.784807190854859
the creation of europol represents one step towards achieving this objective . however , we must take the next step , which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine european judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom , security and justice .    2.887873985731044
this draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application , at member state level , of pre - existing conventions on other legal areas . the intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the member states and in the european convention on human rights .    2.5312340324955103
it is this concern for basic rights , freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals . we recommend that the council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue .    2.398679967205408
as for UNK , more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded .    2.8904226930891017
the procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights .    2.9337567308997916
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.799445241956104
mr president , legislating in criminal matters is often UNK , wrongly , with arguments of individual freedom and security .    2.2026980161300065
is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed ?    2.6669296908974065
is one free when security is no longer assured ?    2.7860007396291224
modern criminal law UNK around the quest for a balance , a dialogue between security and freedom .    2.3797201314609646
and this dialogue is open - ended ; it UNK to the demands of the day .    3.132941617728157
nowadays , certain forms of crime are cross - border crimes and it is , of course , in the interests of the member states to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them .    3.2551289623752258
but the council ' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts .    2.555694689643084
first , the form : the draft convention is vague in the extreme , and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society .    2.612923893463612
it is not just a question of style .    2.7513039102615537
we are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter .    2.7691511151644157
then the content : the council draft UNK the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems , varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain member states of the union .    2.0414586412937927
it makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ .    2.5161310880757912
i should like to stress this point because it is paramount .    3.0052690965596236
we must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the european union without having stood trial and that , in some states , custody is abused and used as a means of UNK UNK .    2.913381055044904
other european countries , on the other hand , do not accept UNK as sufficient proof of guilt .    3.1781187962604864
it is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in europe , which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves .    2.598626580577595
mr president , as you know , all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago , but with nearly a thousand UNK a year in our prisons , they have not really abolished it ?    2.7325407081300956
mr president , co - operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market europe , but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation : the fundamental human rights and freedoms , laid down in the european convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .    2.600993296254077
we can but thank the parliamentary committees , which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far - reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which , in its initial format , we did not find at all convincing .    2.658440162732542
i turn to mr schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives , but in connection with general political concerns .    2.4313860501759743
if it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or UNK these , they can be found with the rapporteurs , among them the author of the report on this convention .    2.8144730720744247
i thus believe that mr schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks .    2.0276818448781846
as i have said , numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - i am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team .    2.3871613044622855
in brief , this parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters ; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters .    2.4501307367231453
we need hard and fast rules .    2.444121528465877
the council has behaved in an UNK manner , changing tack in mid - course , and is nowhere to be seen .    2.356439190066676
we would , on the other hand , like to thank commissioner vitorino for attending the debate held in this chamber .    3.1721108441992527
as i have said , we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in europe - without UNK from interceptions , without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than UNK justice , and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds UNK .    2.3369368248145195
. mr president , the draft convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the member states of the european union is approaching adoption by the council .    2.9564605039369063
most say it is about time .    3.1793543628643195
according to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the council in april 1997 , the work on the draft UNK convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997 .    3.3061731475443668
more time will pass before the convention actually enters into force , given the fact that this requires member states ' ratification .    3.026068244881644
even with the new rules introduced by the treaty of amsterdam , UNK its entry into force once at least half of the member states have adopted the convention , i would like to urge the member states to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this convention .    3.2820798827804465
past experience with ratification of european union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing .    2.546437811727531
this convention will not create a new or different system of mutual assistance .    2.563472542211931
instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time , such as the ones foreseen by the council of europe convention on mutual assistance of UNK and the UNK treaty .    3.2109058403932407
the draft that the council has UNK contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several members of parliament .    3.1215850856282006
it is a considerable achievement of the convention that where at all possible requested member states shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting member states .    2.389887940269856
furthermore , requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities .    2.2851634133195313
generally speaking , there are two kinds of provisions : those that create an obligation to render assistance , such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences , controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications ; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for member states that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed , for example , the provisions on joint investigation teams , UNK investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents .    2.406475158174066
the commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques , given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime .    2.1416954928459213
it is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations .    2.5301124171357148
however , one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence .    3.183037648690511
i very much appreciate that the report of mr di pietro , whom i salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time , includes the right of defence as one of its main points .    3.0124670750353566
at the present time it is entirely up to the member states to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the council of europe ' s court of human rights in strasbourg .    3.6720431212648386
it remains to be seen whether this will change with the new european union charter on fundamental rights , work on which has just begun .    2.6635082602273936
we must recognise that article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision .    2.3409277304309004
the article was carefully UNK in council in very lengthy discussions , in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered .    2.3637546215549143
as far as criminal investigations are concerned , for which i am responsible , i take note of the invitation that was addressed to the commission and the council by several members of the european parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis , having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts .    2.916172619677137
however , we must be realistic .    2.9777550325420394
the text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set - ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the maastricht and amsterdam treaties respectively .    2.2578349613871573
this is what we have , and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken .    2.852457317441574
i am quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial systems of the member states will ease the road we have ahead of us .    2.6525851682454005
apart from that , the tampere european council has already indicated in which direction we , in the commission , should go .    3.3841053399204295
the commission sincerely hopes that the european parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields .    2.928358234137612
i do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years .    2.1857931417308225
i am counting more on the european parliament to be not only a critical observer , as it has been in this case , but also an active player in taking the union forward in the fight against crime .    3.323879712627084
vote    3.1522193301854244
ii . the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 85 / 611 / eec on the coordination of laws , regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ( ucits ) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses ( com ( 1998 ) UNK - c4 - UNK / 1998 - 1998 / UNK ( cod )    2.131705798836331
goebbels ( pse ) .    2.710345687505359
( fr ) madam president , when a UNK , a spaniard , a UNK and a german have to negotiate in english , linguistic ambiguities will arise .    3.028690744268222
i therefore propose , in agreement with the rapporteur , mr olle schmidt , that the words ' issued by ' be replaced with ' dealt with ' throughout amendment no 37 .    2.651218396060127
the words ' issued by ' also need to be added after the words ' transferable securities ' .    3.0794076698232367
the amended text will then read , and again i must read it in english , which is the UNK UNK of our parliament : ' transferable securities issued by over the counter derivatives dealt with ' , etc .    2.600442326950056
we must also ensure that amendment no 45 by mr garcía - margallo y marfil is amended if it is to be adopted , because the same problem will arise .    3.0277260944352786
mr goebbels , i am sorry , but i think you are UNK the UNK ; amendment no 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words ' with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale ' be moved . you were asking for the place to be changed .    2.5914990633198536
madam president , my apologies , i was looking at amendment no 36 , which logically UNK amendment no 37 .    2.3445555152827895
but , you are right , we are discussing amendment no 37 and here too we have a similar problem .    3.79437787648213
it is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating .    2.9511484551406624
the text therefore reads : ' instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation ' .    1.9805734700604078
my apologies once again for my mistake .    2.5690730600589093
are there any objections to this oral amendment ?    2.2457542482078305
( parliament adopted the oral amendment )    2.269709167620376
( parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes )    2.1978503093952346
madam president , i asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as president of this house . we have a procedure for visits to be made to this house to report on certain situations .    3.1826696084776653
i do respect and agree with this procedure , as i also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone . however , for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals , political parties , including my own , and institutions .    2.9376612851904325
i feel that this behaviour , particularly in your presence , is unacceptable and totally UNK , especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign .    3.1611296822762425
therefore , particularly out of respect for you , i must say that i do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this .    3.2749767403534533
i was told that this was a personal response .    3.01368407100181
note will be taken of it in the minutes .    3.6661322565003585
madam president , particularly out of respect for you , for myself and for this house , i did not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question . however , as a member of this house , as general secretary of a party in the basque country and as an ordinary citizen of spain , i will do so now because of the extremely serious accusations made against individuals and against parties like my own , which has a long democratic tradition , and which has scrupulously respected and defended human rights for many years .    3.174252915840356
madam president , i want to express my concern that this clear defence by mr knörr borràs of human rights apparently does not prevent his government from cooperating in parliament with a political group which not only does not condemn , but UNK with and encourages , violence against people and property .    2.3293178685923888
i see that mr gorostiaga atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject .    2.8930085947719957
we are not going to enter into a debate now .    3.0644837036398687

before the vote    3.672320697945502
madam president , i want to condemn the absence of the presidency - in - office of the council .    2.535758337110698
on third pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice , it is unacceptable for the presidency - in - office of the council to be absent .    2.733585187915671
i also want to mention the translation problems , of which i will give just one example , as we do not have much time .    3.5623642725095173
correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts .    2.236986579035927
amendment no 83 in italian , which is the original version , states that ' UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK da una persona di UNK UNK o da un UNK o legale esterno ' .    2.420708345471162
the term ' legale esterno ' has been translated into french as ' avocat neutre ' . i have no idea what an ' avocat neutre ' is .    2.331629935188737
it rather seems like a contradiction in terms .    2.2752283922770795
however , in the spanish version the ' UNK ' has disappeared completely .    2.8070313190229794
madam president , you have said several times that this is a very serious problem .    3.5694030444509304
the lawyer - UNK should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced .    2.667777807023168
we shall address this problem and check all the translations .    2.490692409896905
madam president , i simply wanted to add my voice to that of mrs palacio vallelersundi before the vote started , to say that i regret very much the absence of the council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the third pillar .    2.82701231010964
i should like you , madam president , to express to the council our wish that they be present at such votes in future .    2.8952828023791435
quite , i am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and i shall be most happy to pass this on .    2.8545479428010565
relating to amendment no 31    3.5184000706599106
madam president , in the phrase which reads ' where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned ' , the words ' under the national law of the requesting or requested member state ' should be added after ' where ' .    2.1554576949710564
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )    1.859109816008224
madam president , in the heat of the moment i forgot to mention that , in my report on the excessive deficit procedure , the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the spanish version .    3.062394934999766
an ' s ' has been omitted and instead of reading ' la propuesta nos parece correcta ' , it reads ' la propuesta no parece correcta ' which is completely the contrary .    2.0396149948701017
i just wanted to correct this .    2.3285673475942716

. ( de ) madam president , i have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification , because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations .    2.753632554687119
i hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this .    2.455703118758763
the second sentence should read : ' . , UNK UNK UNK ' ( which is why we have this aid ) , then ' ohne UNK UNK ' ( unconditionally and ) should be deleted , and it continues as follows : ' ohne UNK von UNK UNK von UNK UNK UNK UNK werden müssen ' . ( and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries ) .    2.542771160775078
this clarification would certainly meet with our approval .    2.359847393287461

madam president , i voted in favour of the schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because , as i stated in this chamber this morning , i consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the european union be put to good use .    3.3807498474380546
the vast majority of these citizens are elderly people and pensioners , who want a peaceful retirement and who , after the problems encountered during the course of their working lives , have at last found financial peace of mind .    2.2911672359500734
the regulation of investments in transferable securities , the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners , is thus a major step forward for the european union .    2.5872091710749516
. ( sv ) olle schmidt ' s report is an improvement on the commission ' s proposal .    2.789141189089252
i am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so - called eu passport .    2.2693288025702514
however , i do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all member states have approved commissioner monti ' s proposal for minimum taxes on capital .    3.1523132769836386
in its present form , the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets , in spite of the fact that what is most important is to UNK them .    3.306338656634385
like the whole of the group of the greens / european free alliance , i have therefore voted against the proposal to amend directive no 1 and have abstained from voting on the proposal to amend directive no 2 .    2.9374550383645692
brok report ( a5 - 0029 / 2000 )    3.0224086813372475
madam president , there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the european union .    3.2178395105272135
we have before us malta and cyprus , which are two states keen to become members .    2.8238559382963095
given that the complexity of the procedures has been greatly reduced , i voted in favour not only because this measure addresses the need for cohesion between these applicant states and the union , but also because i believe that this should be taken as an invitation from parliament to the council and the commission to ensure that cyprus and malta become fully - fledged members of the european union as swiftly as possible .    3.3580017832151277
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) it is with great satisfaction that i welcome this report on the pre - accession strategy for cyprus and malta , whose accession is vital to the future of the european union in the mediterranean .    2.733148753816326
the aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for cyprus and malta , starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years ( 2000 - 2004 ) .    2.714122936341022
the proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire .    2.320687546324512
this new move follows on from the step taken at the helsinki european council last december , when it was decided that malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in february 2000 , i . e . by the end of this month , in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the union and the adjustments required .    2.6982280240966157
as far as cyprus is concerned , although the council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of cyprus to the european union . it also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition , which i welcome .    2.501507157603381
i have , in fact , always thought that insisting on a settlement of the present situation , in which one - third of this republic ' s territory is occupied by turkey , before starting negotiations with cyprus was quite unfair .    2.494630111621638
on a more general note , it is true that the socio - economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries .    3.0520936678702553
however , they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the european union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire .    3.4731672097246964
until 1999 , this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols ( b7 - UNK ) .    2.166894699059398
both countries also qualify for financial aid under the meda programme ( b7 - UNK ) .    2.15475320854538
during the first and second UNK of the 2000 budget , the european parliament stressed that the new ' pre - accession ' heading ( b7 - 0 ) , proposed by the commission in the preliminary draft budget , should not be limited to the candidate countries of central and eastern europe and should also be extended to malta and cyprus .    3.2145309547687315
however , because of the council ' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 ( pre - accession ) in the financial perspectives , the european parliament agreed , by way of exception , and i stress that it was by way of exception , that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 ( external action ) of the financial perspectives for the year 2000 .    3.21328882322897
at the same time , the european parliament created a new heading : ' pre - accession strategy for mediterranean countries ' ( b7 - UNK ) , under which two new articles were created for the pre - accession strategy for malta and cyprus pending the commission ' s presentation , following the helsinki european council , of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the financial perspectives .    2.7002696318607744
this proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases !    3.229420313437334
. i welcome mr brok ' s report supporting with amendments the commission ' s proposals seeking to prepare cyprus and malta for eu membership .    2.907534322925056
the package will grant around euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year .    2.655675149528254
it is , however , regrettable that the commission has UNK multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis .    2.5965567718882543
this is bound to have an impact on the ability of malta and cyprus to plan spending .    2.9636400750235183
the funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the community ' acquis ' .    2.8724371974596257
given the already advanced state of these two countries , compared to other applicants , this should easily allow them to be ' technically and UNK ' ready for membership at the end of the 5 - year programme .    2.427335984680687
cederschiöld report ( a5 - 0020 / 2000 )    2.7218909894400274
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) as a member of the committee on economic and monetary affairs during the last parliamentary term , i welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency .    2.759618454975323
the union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting .    2.259995064429162
consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets , bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away .    2.429820901289671
and the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify .    2.7993945856382023
the european information centres , which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency , should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting .    2.4249722746777396
on another level , we must ensure that community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting .    2.515409120839037
as far as criminal sanctions are concerned , measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the european parliament .    2.993198161000912
the purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the international convention for the suppression of counterfeiting currency of 20 april 1929 and to facilitate its application by the member states .    2.5303476925233315
each member state must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable .    3.837692796507208
these offences must be punishable even if they relate to UNK and coins UNK in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 january 2002 .    2.2953347060632114
this is a basic element of the decision .    3.0546562105328805
i cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected .    2.995821930568125
we must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years !    2.226396368114108
they should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation .    2.5933783851224432
it would also appear to be in the union ' s interest for all member states to help protect the euro , especially sweden , denmark , the united kingdom and greece , which will not be introducing the euro on 1 january 2002 .    3.6986382064506658
although this framework decision is a step in the right direction , it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards .    2.460222861096476
there is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems .    2.452261934084575
that brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the european council in tampere .    2.898663067186586
.    2.489189446364389
( da ) mrs cederschiöld ' s report reflects an extremely UNK form of logic . the eu introduces a common currency .    2.457473970798346
the risk of counterfeiting increases . counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire eu ; the punishment must therefore be the same in each member state .    2.539442596689736
the harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be UNK against the background of problems of one ' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity .    2.7185438545891563
there is nothing to indicate that the member states ' legal principles , legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting . nor , in the light of the international convention of 20 april 1929 , can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases .    2.280438792140366
we are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the UNK of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such UNK grounds . instead , the focus should be upon preventing the real problem .    2.7270629377347753
. i welcome this proposal to protect the euro against UNK .    3.3237765037968576
when the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 january 2002 , everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the euro .    2.614725769120345
di pietro report ( a5 - 0019 / 2000 )    2.7952356948432793
madam president , as the representative of the pensioners ' party , there have been many occasions on which i have stated , at the committee stage , that the european union must intervene in regulating the lives of the elderly , and in the measures and rules on pensions , as is already the case , in coordination .    3.218540384925934
similarly , as concerns the field of justice and criminal law , which we have discussed today , i believe not only that the different criminal law , UNK and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated , but also that we must at last formulate common standards : an offence committed in italy must also be viewed as an offence in great britain , spain or elsewhere .    3.165776434726908
i believe that we , the parliament of the european union , who are the elected representatives of the citizens , must give UNK impetus to ensuring that the european union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens , including that of justice , and that of pensions .    3.6207758056601675
.    2.489189446364389
we vote against this report , because by allowing trans - border interception of telecommunication and reversing the burden of proof , the convention will create the legal ground for large scale bugging operations in the eu .    2.3282592807196907
that means , making a european bugging system like the transatlantic UNK operation ' echelon ' perfectly legal .    2.0084275409611316
this convention will lead to gross abuses of people ' s rights to UNK .    3.1644497481099867
it is a major threat to civil liberties in eu .    2.6818315853420818
resolution on the commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000 - 2005    3.3379837455554453
. commissioner prodi pointed out that ' africa is our responsibility ' and not apparently that of the usa and other major countries .    2.593798186455155
i worked in africa 30 years ago , and it was poor and underdeveloped but the problems are now more catastrophic .    2.671844849257671
two million people died of aids in africa last year , approximately 200 000 died in wars .    2.471328948085562
in zambia 25 % of teachers have died of aids .    2.5019145999974373
in some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today .    2.169555286278488
our policies in africa lack coherence .    2.8033348479262425
there is huge duplication of effort .    2.5109981728724486
furthermore , the UNK of debt remains an obstacle to real development .    3.078192923901784
it is patently clear that africa has become the forgotten continent .    2.2495679852730808
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) in its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000 - 2005 , the commission repeats that europe needs to become a ' global actor ' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world .    2.38233118079958
what should this global actor ' s objective be ?    2.627752027971505
doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of ' to defend the countries of europe better ' , since that is the traditional and UNK purpose of political associations .    2.4508683625351653
and yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen .    2.410002113838124
all we find are vague phrases about ' strategic partnerships ' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of europe would apparently bring with it .    2.198194467675525
the omission of this principal objective is highly revealing .    2.3246822474107334
it demonstrates one of the main flaws in the european union , a little - known , almost always UNK flaw , but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens ' loss of interest .    2.815214956093384
addressing the fundamental question of relations with the united states , the commission mentions just one priority : ' we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade ' ( page 4 ) .    2.621526464863605
while we are on the subject , where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend european interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way , one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict , which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the commission to fight its corner .    2.398685571361166
how strange that the commission should lose its instinct for self - preservation just as europe is integrating .    2.516236916084748
i think there are three reasons for this : 1 ) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states , the european institutions have lost touch with the people and , in losing touch with the people , they have become UNK in the hands of foreign interests ; 2 ) having lost touch with the people , the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole UNK of the people , but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system ; 3 ) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains ; but it also causes far more to be lost because , when it breaks nations , it breaks UNK expressions of solidarity and , with them , the willingness to present a united front .    2.7521222297314956
. ( fr ) i share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate .    2.1999865690184395
i do , of course , understand the constraints of the moment and i am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure .    3.3979705530741295
however , experience has taught me that , in politics , modest ambitions are never the key to success !    2.6986414026506704
i shall not keep saying that i am disappointed , because you need to hope in order to be disappointed . and i have had no hope since the investiture debate .    3.0236772651013473
as for the future , given that the commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in austria , i am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of UNK a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the union .    3.443064813610823
- ( it ) on behalf of the italian communists , i would like to express great dissatisfaction at the contents of the document , which was expected to define the strategic guidelines for europe up until the year 2005 .    2.82266493927298
employment : for many years now , the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality , and yet , despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless , the same UNK is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment .    3.1465771604812494
and yet our president is a fine UNK .    2.5117606359104894
and yet president prodi himself gave firm guidance to the italian government during those years and is therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifices demanded of our fellow citizens and which they made in order to sign up to the euro , and he is aware of the major role played by italy in european development .    2.918169737524038
for this very reason , we cannot agree to cut pensions further .    2.999705619001827
there is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner .    2.8835992171631952
what is more , the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control .    2.2222800074717073
i would therefore ask the commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens .    2.005059880900483
i referred to the case of italy , not only because the president is very familiar with it , but because community statistics ( eurostat ) themselves reveal that not only has italy ' s welfare expenditure - currently 25 . 9 % - been below the community average ( 28 . 2 % ) since 1990 , but that it has also been well below that of countries considered to be doing well , such as germany ( 29 . 9 % ) and france ( 30 . 8 % ) .    2.5865731491039723
europe ' s role : we first need to emphasise that europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict : only then can we talk of the ' military ' role of the union .    2.6723731939361386
agriculture and health : we see the issue differently from the commission : in our view there are no consumers : there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health , quality and respect for the environment .    2.749808082946764
moreover , these are factors which create employment .    2.7975842210054975
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) the proposed action and programme presented by mr prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again .    2.2190242184234554
in fact , the word seems to have been UNK from the commission ' s vocabulary , whereas liberal and american references UNK .    3.2420850066186944
mr prodi UNK to the contested concept of ' governance ' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the imf , whose ideological agenda is UNK solely on liberalism and monetarism .    1.9920655010865471
the shift in meaning is not just UNK . the only logical thing to do on reading this document is to pursue the mass market and generalised deregulation and forget about the UNK of european policy which our citizens hoped for .    2.5994792413621592
mr prodi talks solely of ' mechanisms ' and ' structures ' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people .    2.1975932406522674
enlargement appears to be an end in itself , but unless decisions are made on a social policy , a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the union , the europe bequeathed to us at the end of mr prodi ' s presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalised globalisation , rather than the community of destiny which we hope for .    3.0677950991620744
finally , mr prodi ' s complacency towards the austrian government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol ( which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations ) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence .    2.3690959193286947
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) the european union is UNK its unbridled expansionist ambitions .    2.8434167749752537
the commission ' s objective for the next five years is to become a ' global actor ' by showing ' genuine leadership on the world stage ' .    2.5952919029266837
but the prodi commission now wants to transform the eu so that it can apply for joint global governance with the united states , which it also sees as its future competitor and rival .    2.556950662565806
this new imperial policy advocates reorganising european and national institutions , strengthening the power of the state , increasing competition , establishing a european army and redistributing financial resources .    2.250427417367647
even daring to refer to the defence of a ' european social model ' is a UNK lie because the more the eu UNK the united states , the more it becomes its UNK .    3.0759339852033034
we shall vote against these objectives , because we are fighting against this policy both in parliament and on the streets .    3.0659700052432837
a european charter of fundamental rights would be the only UNK of light in this policy but , yet again , there is no provision for the people of europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically .    3.1230180477710987
firstly , the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the commission ' s programme .    2.5815002452201172
secondly , in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years , we consider that the main question to be considered by the commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the eu which neither the programme nor the motion mention .    3.312519232204276
in our opinion , the commission ' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the european political initiative being returned by the governments of the member states following the santer commission scandal .    3.625118200983927
this is very positive as this is how the national parliaments , on which the governments depend , will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to european construction .    2.8859567920463793
the truth is that the european parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about europe , as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections .    2.695317493905658
the mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the member states must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent , more transparent and more democratic .    3.1624508144521495
we welcome the efforts of mr prodi to improve the public image of the commission and the need for the latter to agree with this house and the council .    4.424965520765192
however , the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms , particularly by creating a council of ministers for europe which , by itself and in coordination with the other european institutions , can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the european councils into specific actions .    2.850905103703114
corrie report ( a5 - 0032 / 2000 )    2.8217597644968238
madam president , the work of the acp - eu joint assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models UNK from the lomé conventions .    2.562227834612006
these fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them .    2.3411982264708695
the developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade , despite their vulnerable economies .    2.7001917464693466
the cooperation agreement with south africa is a prime example .    2.81718659567181
the council approved the agreement negotiated by the commission despite the fact that a basic section , namely agriculture , had not been finalised .    2.8455180069041157
as paul - marie coûteaux rightly said in his intervention yesterday and in his proposed amendments , one wonders exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represents .    2.002707894120394
it is most worrying , especially as a similar agreement with mexico appears to be taking shape .    2.4066197637621007
nor is it possible to support the rapporteur ' s call for the european development fund to be merged with the community budget .    3.678667894115605
we want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each member state , which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature .    3.259487929904534
alas , there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no - one feels responsible being UNK and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the edf .    2.7873577869120565
madam president , i welcome mr corrie ' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the assembly has carried out over the last year .    3.16600148469908
the report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing lomé convention , which expires at the end of this month .    2.6767003884148437
the new agreement provides for a development budget of eur 13 . 5 billion over the next seven years .    2.418572924790013
it is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the acp countries .    2.5274793020827078
UNK efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste .    2.689449065328426
civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects .    2.991576549131219
i hope that before the end of this new lomé convention we will be able to welcome cuba as a full member .    3.2045389114223295
. the joint united nations programme on aids estimated that by the end of 1998 , there was a total of 33 . 4 million people in the world living with the hiv infection .    2.642976510566324
over 95 % of all hiv infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub - saharan africa is the worst affected region in the world .    2.5946837512492884
while only around 10 % of the world ' s population live in sub - saharan africa , 70 % of all people who became infected with the aids virus in 1998 live there .    2.4650369566940533
80 % of the 13 . 9 million aids related deaths in the world have taken place in this region .    3.099387660268669
the aids problem in africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one .    2.456983562972209
the effects of the aids pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub - saharan region is being UNK or reversed .    2.413940504953467
from the data which i am referring to today , it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate UNK on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide - ranging impact .    2.924305907065433
it is clear that the spread of aids in the sub - saharan african continent is linked to poverty .    2.361933411047857
aids UNK that may cost $ 18 000 per annum for one person are obviously not affordable by countries whose annual health budget may be less than $ 5 per capita .    1.8004089834634942
it is incumbent on the european union and the united nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner .    3.1413390046226572
we must primarily ensure that the basic needs of the poorest people in the countries most affected by the aids disease are fully met . these countries include ethiopia , UNK , mozambique , tanzania , UNK and zambia .    3.174969795307804
prevention education should begin early in the primary school UNK in these countries .    2.434733018257629
appropriate messages about the health effects of aids must be delivered to primary school children by teachers who are comfortable with the information that they are trying to communicate .    2.226319185863725
health facilities and staff of ngos need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients .    2.443571927916633
it is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective .    2.4225038884826446
at a more central level , there is a need for more effective co - UNK between government donors , international ngos , indigenous ngos and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted .    2.210512667838215
already weak economies are being further weakened in africa by the aids virus .    2.381368884906362
already stretched resources are being further stretched .    2.7990993670342714
50 % or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an aids related disease in the countries where aids figures are highest .    2.0955201408983166
on a separate matter altogether , i would like to support cuba ' s membership as an acp country within the framework of the new lomé convention which will shortly be agreed between the european union and african , caribbean and pacific countries .    2.836293914254383
i know that this is somewhat controversial , particularly , because of the attitude of the united states government towards the castro regime .    3.0885635813701198
however , on this occasion , the european union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the lomé convention accord .    2.9659117042709466
good governance criteria broadly covering questions of refugees , corruption , human rights and democracy will be part of the finalised accord between the european union and all countries signing the lomé convention from africa , the caribbean and the pacific region .    2.6671730099572386
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) the lomé convention , on which the entire structure of relations between the european union and the 71 african , caribbean and pacific countries rests , is still the most efficient and ambitious development tool in north - south relations .    2.480157450837113
after years of ' good and UNK service ' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the european union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries .    2.790116365751329
it is the humane face of europe .    2.522341576656499
and the merit of mr corrie ' s report is that it highlights the value of this original , proactive development instrument , together with the work carried out by the joint assembly .    2.8626267556698783
especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened .    2.3421249012323666
the partnership between the european union and the acp was negotiated in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium .    3.2269902511780786
i am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties , opening new prospects for this partnership .    2.207205370912278
now , more than 30 years after the inauguration of an unprecedented partnership between north and south , the tool which has proven its worth and served its time needs to be adapted in order to meet new challenges .    2.451923038409748
which is why the new 20 - year agreement due to be signed in UNK on 31 may represents more than the simple renewal of the conventions regulating relations between europe and the acp .    2.6953765461177235
it should seal their revival .    2.4677517737379775
it UNK illustrates the political dimension of a partnership which constitutes the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north - south relations .    2.0347689378738836
the joint assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of europe and the developing countries defend their common interests .    2.908837440364306
after the debacle in seattle , our duty from now on is to adopt a concerted position and ensure that the rules of world trade develop and are used to fight poverty .    2.7618141001036287
the partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised .    2.9140712404321434
then , by UNK actions to micro - projects and making them accessible to the civil society in the southern countries and , finally , by calling for enlargement and the rapid accession of cuba , which all the acp called for at nassau and which has now made a formal application .    2.640667792468961
but we must also preserve the original spirit of the lomé convention , which has enabled relations between the european union and the acp to become what they are today : a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect .    2.921658020423333
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) a few days after the demonstrations in seattle , the ministers of the european union imposed an agreement compatible with the rules of the wto on the acp , i . e . their former colonies .    2.8315692299922626
apart from reducing the volume of exports from these countries to the community market , what we term ' development aid ' to the acp has fallen constantly , from 70 % of total european union aid in 1986 to 30 % in 1998 .    2.356537412873238
the european union prefers to send its funds to eastern europe , the former ussr and asia , where there is greater opportunity for profit .    2.611184267331901
the acp - eu agreements make a mockery of democratic principles and the fight against corruption , by sparing those who are responsible : when will sanctions and controls be imposed on total - elf , which is supplying those responsible for the civil war in the congo ?    2.566867676615859
or on shell ?    3.0088724784887977
although the market is presented as the only rule which applies to acp - eu relations , the european union also plans to police immigration , as article 13 UNK , in order to justify the policy of the european states against illegal immigrants .    3.2102359018275406
we do not accept this agreement , which UNK people of the wherewithal to build societies which are independent of the european multinationals and banks .    2.9498989226025274
. mr president , i am full of praise at the sterling efforts of meps - some of my labour colleagues among them - on the acp - eu joint assembly and their efforts towards securing a new lomé agreement , which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world .    2.5888524832150273
few of my constituents will probably be aware that the eu is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world .    3.0006451584893212
while others may have the biggest UNK , the eu has the deepest pockets .    3.163776144419937
this is something that the eu can rightly be proud of , and i think we should shout it from the rooftops more often .    3.2527864357088303
the labour government ' s record in britain is also a proud one .    2.724090153557172
UNK short , mp , is one of the few cabinet - level ministers for international development in the world and , as such , can take her case to the very heart of government .    2.9828067438234958
UNK brown , mp , meanwhile , has led international efforts to UNK crippling levels of third world debt and ensured that labour ' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the english channel .    1.914555713033854
whether through the minimum wage in manchester or debt relief in UNK , labour ' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same .    2.221551957162768
there is still much to be done , however .    3.4014906888123217
the next great challenge is to re - launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last december in seattle .    2.129574232215682
it must be a ' development round ' , in which developing countries , effectively excluded from previous rounds , are fully included .    2.578072998208855
for the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves .    2.562070516561358
developing countries want trade not aid , a help up not a hand - out .    2.2614250745420645
and the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products .    2.401566831227845
in this way , the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good , to benefit the poor not just the wealthy , the many not just the few .    2.588095904268713
thus , whether through the new deal in UNK or fair trade in UNK , labour ' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same .    2.361056281678678
swoboda report ( a5 - 0031 / 2000 )    2.838502806968585
. ( el ) the eu ' s stabilisation and association agreement with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , in the form of a joint agreement as established by article UNK of the eu treaty , can contribute to the stabilisation and development of that balkan republic .    3.0001320689935236
in parallel , it can benefit from substantial financial support via the phare programme .    2.492253890526642
however , the eu ' s present policy in the balkans is fragmentary , inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature .    2.9030876647828516
there are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach .    2.3001350196835055
there is no sense of UNK for the balkans , which would include everyone without exceptions or UNK .    2.9261515005603798
finally , intervention by the european union to solve the problem of fyrom ' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more UNK - and to respond more UNK towards negotiating fyrom ' s principles within a reasonable time scale , is necessary and useful .    2.44283151907165
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) the commission ' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the european union and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the community would appear to respond to a primary concern : a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south - east europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the second world war .    2.256985725521405
having been crushed UNK the UNK of UNK communism , this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s .    2.524706492152493
and yet , under these difficult conditions , especially since the military intervention in the balkans by nato , some of these genuinely european countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which UNK them to aspire to join the community .    2.6410828082214515
in this sense , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case .    2.211783677959642
exemplary because it proves that the balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the european union in stability and association agreements .    2.792877345576276
symbolic because it reflects well on the fifteen ' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region ( bosnia - herzegovina , croatia , federal republic of yugoslavia , fyrom and albania ) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement .    2.4198183602936516
the uen group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states . a satisfactory solution cannot be found in the balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned ; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion .    2.3412008692240134
the union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to UNK a platform of common values with it , of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone .    2.2610538890936946
it is not its job to UNK to people in their choices or , failing that , reinvent a new variation on a ' sense of history ' which UNK self - determination as a one - way street .    2.062822823845075
the community construction only makes sense if it creates positive UNK alone , and the uen group hopes that this signal to fyrom and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully - paid up part of europe .    2.4875856894023705
frassoni report ( a5 - 0021 / 2000 )    2.849504181973245
. ( da ) the danish social democrats in the european parliament have today voted in favour of mrs UNK frassoni ' s report , according to which the european parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the commission about the implementing provisions for the council ' s decision of 28 june 1999 concerning comitology .    3.154714514823327
in all matters , we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision - making procedures involved in eu cooperation , for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control .    3.3073245325980225
we should also like to see this arrangement extended to other areas in which , following the agreement , the european parliament ' s relevant committees will be sent material when they ask for it .    3.067022576555636
( the sitting was suspended at 1 . 23 p . m . and resumed at 3 p . m . )    1.762562042369662
company restructuring in europe    3.3048604007788773
the next item is the commission statement - company restructuring in europe .    2.1568864331039594
. mr president , industrial change , which can be gradual or sudden , is driven by new technologies , worldwide competition or consumer preferences .    2.504219259476381
it has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion , but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated , prepared for and managed .    2.607121228508461
the UNK of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures .    2.0602685397833196
companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities .    3.096862336335583
sometimes this calls for mergers of activities .    2.445041713015206
the commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change .    3.151359567381048
we are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis .    2.2345117439210913
we have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large - scale operations of corporate restructuring , often affecting the lives of large numbers of european people .    2.5136288707473184
in some cases these operations were prepared well in advance , fully involving workers ' representatives , with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions .    1.9844540066870708
where necessary , workers likely to be affected were prepared through employability measures to face the challenge of sudden unemployment .    2.2768700776154214
in other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected .    2.0495228875763263
on every occasion , and as recently as last october in this house , the commission has highlighted the following basic positions .    3.1162225223196156
firstly , decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management .    2.7527460222645233
this means that , when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences , job losses for example , companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution .    2.2019988623438085
this requires anticipation , timely preparation and careful management of these processes .    2.2473124482151694
thirdly , nothing can justify the absence of timely , effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers ' and employees ' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced .    2.1949051736482774
worker involvement is always , and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring , not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations .    2.831411855372499
in the end it is also a decisive factor of their success , as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust , dialogue , partnership and solidarity between its different components .    2.2778902841744704
these basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in europe .    2.627166119143815
this is what intelligent restructuring is about .    2.37365052005672
it is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns , as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past .    2.0840814411186037
we have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the european union .    2.626018832997005
we have set minimum requirements at european level , which all member states and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses , especially when they are massive , or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers .    2.5698844353774684
the collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the european works council directive constitute our legal framework , protecting the workers ' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively .    2.7074282571509345
as regards the national and / or local level of employee involvement , the commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees ' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented , as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions .    2.4717867305549306
however , even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management ' s attitude is socially UNK .    2.310152883807103
in fact , the commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today .    3.463174449089597
in a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment , the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change , anticipation , risk prevention and employability .    2.546292571612106
that is why in november 1998 the commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support .    2.4657442922335107
we thank you for that .    3.393068053455689
unfortunately , the other branch of the legislative power , the council , has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it .    3.281277707178028
i hope that this debate contributes to reminding member states of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative .    2.994574665785233
we have recently heard from the portuguese presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched .    3.0612583717718187
the forthcoming french presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves .    2.2498748227678904
the commission sincerely hopes that parliament and the council quickly UNK this important dossier which constitutes , in our view , the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today .    2.724462809817931
as for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their european workforce .    2.1861735812916745
they may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force .    2.4283914932511115
the commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this .    2.6193999380899498
in any case , i wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them , notably through relevant national UNK instances .    2.4406839300087433
the commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the european works council directive .    2.7564762785235826
as recognised in the report , which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks , we accept that the directive contains some loopholes .    3.5644980260998698
nevertheless , as my colleague , commissioner diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions , when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately , different considerations must be taken into account .    2.3834340556204485
first , any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements , unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies .    2.3652429574963447
secondly , an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like european company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal .    2.2790161895371015
the successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the UNK directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above .    2.6883818667551918
that is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the european works council directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive .    2.858236568875294
action is not limited to legislation .    2.8204780856134466
to encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the commission is also developing the recommendations of the UNK report by preparing the setting up of a european observatory on industrial change .    2.850041900896964
we are also developing another suggestion of that expert group , the managing change report .    2.2294245919363345
let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this house .    3.296312536651531
as for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy , let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers ' representatives to be heard by the commission in the framework of the relevant procedure .    3.1022960720937713
generally speaking , we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations , including their effects in terms of employment .    2.593401286233
as an example of this i mention that public authorities , notably the commission , have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 january this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment .    2.626453784278896
to this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years .    2.2752006582109963
the same provision was included in the structural funds regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds .    2.939640120408337
social cohesion and the UNK of policies at eu - level is the focus of the forthcoming lisbon summit .    3.225333030644435
i know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in europe .    2.7312585142629677
thank you very much commissioner .    2.372143463464932
mr gorostiaga atxalandabaso , i understand you have a point of order .    2.721382845193187
if it is a personal statement , would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate , at which stage i would be happy to call you ?    3.5754110128980576
mr president , the problem is one of public honour in this parliament , it is not a personal statement .    3.93904809468788
this morning , the president of parliament , mrs nicole fontaine , repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order .    2.9707740770522406
unfortunately , this is not the first time that madam president has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me .    2.576425343467122
in doing so , madam president has breached rule UNK that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak .    2.302494194893343
she has also breached rule UNK that gives the right to all the members of this house to make observations , observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy , mr vidal - quadras .    2.7187229894081653
i will willingly accept madam president ' s apologies any time .    2.2226501232510927
thank you for your statement .    2.5012896798705437
we will certainly make sure that the president is informed of your statement .    2.876760185484711
i can assure you that as far as i am aware the president never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote .    2.8703631539257586
therefore the house was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage .    2.3526725767751766
mr president , i welcome commissioner liikanen ' s words , and i am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because , although the subject is broad in scope , it also concerns a specific fact .    3.1445169829356057
the subject in question is of great political and social importance .    3.2323202385198933
free enterprise , free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the european union .    2.9533897685388033
company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments , and must therefore be defended .    3.590217917822319
however , all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles .    2.6247165362377523
today , we are witnessing one of these cases , which , on the surface , may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry , but which , if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the european union , will become an UNK rule which will cause problems for many of the member states and the union as a whole .    3.323897441633547
an american company - goodyear - with production sites in italy , germany and england , is reviewing its production and relocation , justifiably , in its own view .    2.1561524234643006
however , it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant community legislation , for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or UNK the obligation to render an account of their use of italian and european public finances .    2.5926789398805004
in italy , commissioner liikanen , goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14 % of the market and which goodyear itself defined as , ' having the most highly - skilled workforce of all its plants ' , a plant which was opened with a total of eur 85 million of european capital .    2.0595718926408106
no notice was given of the closure , and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers , despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private .    2.3348474892235482
europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom , including freedom to use one ' s own money for the purposes of one ' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will , others who make demands and then , when the break is made , refuse even to discuss the terms of the break , despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally .    2.8426870366020625
just now , commissioner liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be UNK .    2.999882656924598
sadly , in this case , he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring .    3.2492637438067677
i would also like to point out to commissioner liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court .    2.9312439877046543
of course , it is always possible , but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down , the idea of going to court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in italy is not very reassuring .    2.6800708729115756
commissioner liikanen , we expect an authoritative intervention .    2.6531525994469005
as parliament , we are , of course , expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this , which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten , as has almost happened already .    3.1280484866439724
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for the second time within the space of four months , we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in europe .    2.4245865236973247
this is - as it was the first time round - UNK off by the reorganisation of large companies , which is linked to a drop in employment .    3.4690067632744808
i would like to make it quite clear that the liberal group is against any political interference in companies , in terms of both finance and management .    2.6033519846629884
our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed .    3.2662282969802816
it appears that goodyear in italy received italian and european subsidies to the tune of approximately eur 40 million .    2.2393000760251156
the company went under despite this .    2.508357672055806
this goes to show that jobs cannot be bought .    2.5034034125390736
the market is a law unto itself .    2.643117326705166
as such , state aid costs the government twice : first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit .    2.2118034675722367
surely this cannot be the role of your , my and the citizens ' tax money ?    3.2581005217162025
all this , of course , does not mean that our group does not share the concern of the italian members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned .    2.9852650299153463
my group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution , for two reasons : firstly because this creates selective responsibility .    2.2102321609503006
a company is pilloried one day and not the next .    2.7758139307723098
why should this be the case ?    3.472576457895006
michelin caused a great stir .    2.6791942259016945
but i did not hear a UNK when UNK and UNK were discussed , where , similarly , a great number of european employees were involved .    2.7727022637333723
secondly , this is not fair towards employees of other companies where UNK also take place and where it hurts too .    2.544678618123773
my group has signed a joint resolution with epp and uen , in which , however , we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names .    3.0673888323309306
this is why the liberal group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9 .    2.420969287490125
if these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted , my group will abstain from the final vote .    2.422539962603249
i do hope that this will not be necessary .    3.686368128891463
mr president , the portuguese presidency and the commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000 - 2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required .    2.541553922910675
the first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs .    3.2775833090315025
yet the current situation in europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed , particularly , and most seriously , by companies which are making huge profits .    2.592488889784628
in the past , workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival . now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant .    2.3158666656715607
examples have been given in spain of michelin and abb - alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for italy .    2.2547395538179598
there is also another hidden way of making workers redundant , as practised for example in spain by the UNK company under the term ' externalising ' . note that sensitive words like ' redundancy ' are not used .    2.0600777920853783
externalising services by UNK these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights .    1.9172181368269987
this is just an UNK way of making workers redundant .    2.3339177898142176
commissioner , if the european institutions really believe in what they say about full employment , they must take clear steps to secure this .    3.143945335569714
they must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations . they must revise the directive on collective redundancies , reduce the working day , link european subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the european union .    2.5219506475029037
mr president , sadly , once again , parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in europe .    2.8800028169611833
yet again , workers are likely to lose their jobs .    2.6876311477331423
this time , i am referring to the workers of the company goodyear in cisterna di latina .    3.2341611754626522
as has already been pointed out , in one month ' s time , 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income .    2.382329891394749
despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the cisterna plant one of the most productive in europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle , while goodyear , after years of benefiting from state and european subsidies , is totally free to walk out .    2.384766671712565
i do not think this is at all fair , either to the workers at the cisterna plant or to all those italian and european citizens whose taxes have , albeit indirectly , enabled goodyear to benefit from the state aids i have just mentioned .    2.3159592945005665
the european commission and the council must , at last , assume all the necessary responsibilities , both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to community and national aid , which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long - term agreements to protect jobs .    3.1191787333299983
today , we ask the commission to start by protecting the workers at goodyear in cisterna , and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible , thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the cisterna plant .    2.799887153802497
mr president , commissioner , i would also like to remind the house that there is very little time available , and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate , timely effect .    2.5872496010020423
mr president , commissioner , as far as restructuring goes , there is no doubt that european companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under .    2.5921093494002783
we are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management .    2.8013018555724036
although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares , this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of UNK , often shareholders , with the sole UNK aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company .    2.733806537359844
rationalised management and improved profits should , in my view , serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost , and any financial benefits should follow .    2.2878401950436626
however , what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate UNK and relocation , with all the familiar consequences , both on the quality of products and at the social level , especially in terms of unemployment , difficult working conditions and increased flexibility : consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level , especially on the family unit .    2.6292238617044923
there is a very real risk of seeing a two - headed monster emerge on this planet , with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital .    2.1865415339127687
surely europe should act as a safeguard , maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare ?    2.2432773411169338
we must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results .    2.60139271937267
finally , allow me to remind you that the third letter of the edd group to which i belong stands for ' difference ' .    2.6479520395376506
europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs . without doubt , the voice of difference in this UNK flood of restructuring .    2.351908349903584
mr president , last month in the uk , in a region that neighbours mine , the michelin group announced significant redundancies at its UNK - on - UNK plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres .    2.289050973892515
i , like all members present , am saddened by this loss of jobs .    2.3981807749507817
equally , i am saddened by the announcement made by goodyear that has prompted this resolution .    2.5326776274716085
but i doubt very much indeed whether a european works council would have been able to change this company ' s decision .    2.9179325284122117
this house is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes , in this institution , forget that europe cannot survive alone .    2.5482601760386205
we need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent .    2.1411024813789394
in my few months here , i have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the eu , nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave .    2.608850762736979
two days later , UNK , which UNK several thousand people in my region , stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their UNK plant .    2.8484732794097165
in a world where surely less regulation is the key , we in this house seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the european union , UNK by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens .    3.0159840522634838
we meps speak often about smes and have now come up with a unique way of creating them .    2.3617738900808902
take a large successful business , add european regulations , and within months you have created a small one .    2.1401067830288936
perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here .    2.50765039733792
mr president , i will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today .    2.3827093631350484
in this respect , i share mrs plooij - van gorsel ' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail .    2.560284154127023
but maybe next time , we ought to discuss UNK , the merger which has now taken place between our UNK UNK and british steel .    3.0026062076232716
i would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the european union and policy in other fields .    2.5338537695045336
in this light , i am pleased that mr liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion , where the interests of employees are concerned , with mrs diamantopoulou but we can involve the commissioners who are active in other fields .    2.9909944879472268
i would also like to advocate coherence in the commission ' s policy from these different vantage points , unlike my predecessor , who holds the belief that there is no need for rules .    2.469924421170994
we need to gain an insight into what companies are like now .    2.270989470528765
at present , we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an anglo - UNK tradition and companies with a UNK tradition .    2.7449451966075475
what remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant : whether it is merely the property and UNK of shareholders , or whether it is a more broadly based UNK society , which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff , consumers , suppliers and the local population and has , in addition , a social function .    2.8468138469258837
as such , i would like to ask these various commission directorates and these various commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments .    2.4619655454995315
i think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in europe , as company policy forms part of this .    2.966032464108373
the government is talking to trade union and goodyear delegates in italy as well , in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the north american multinational in cisterna di latina , an area of central italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations .    2.5793546003025978
the closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty .    2.1279115741948758
the goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight , in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the goodyear workers in the different european countries as well , and there are many of them : france , germany , the united kingdom , poland , luxembourg and UNK .    2.8915840324129687
today , a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery , anxious to find out what their future will be , what solidarity the european union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits .    2.561723444907082
the european union , in all of its aspects , must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes .    2.9387963063898903
mr president , earlier this week president prodi announced that one of the commission ' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment .    2.829121068370752
he acknowledged that 15 million europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion .    2.3578944669839963
what is more , the portuguese presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority .    2.69343053333277
yet , all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies .    2.4343469610622996
the commission ' s decision to allow the abb - alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point .    2.7157697194659036
the new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings .    2.3847858091155403
this global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs .    2.6664676351033543
in my region of the uk in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of abb - alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in britain with 95 jobs being lost in UNK and UNK in UNK .    2.6456946275868387
the company ' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying .    2.547196904233523
it is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee .    2.6803078041947797
point 17 of the community charter of fundamental social rights of workers stresses the need for consultation , adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more member states .    2.413889695206802
i do not think it is simply a matter of a community charter .    3.344746161126346
eu legislation on this issue could not be clearer .    3.543792719930321
the commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences .    2.7629926256041024
we need more joined - up policy making on these issues .    2.287512345299749
what we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation .    2.3971236798814535
this is the only way of respecting article UNK of the treaty .    2.915159197329275
i welcome the statement made by commissioner liikanen , but i also look for the support of this parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers ' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course .    3.064614622337412
i have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .    2.0957031118202805
that concludes the debate .    2.231945172538318
the vote will be taken later this evening .    2.675642108804915
the sitting was suspended at 3 . 50 p . m . and resumed at 4 . 05 p . m .    2.218724116709947
topical and urgent debate    3.188588329552281
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .    1.8738769413675036
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :    2.1588552386927007
b5 - UNK / 2000 by mr galeote quecedo and others , on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the el ejido area in spain ;    2.140395534257037
b5 - UNK / 2000 by mr gasòliba i böhm and mr sánchez garcía , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , on racist and xenophobic incidents in el ejido ( spain ) ;    2.1053878040657747
b5 - 0169 / 2000 by mr puerta and others , on behalf of the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left , on outbursts of xenophobia in el ejido ( spain ) ;    2.1758337111502177
mr president , i am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our african origin .    2.620835193998326
i must firstly congratulate the groups in this house on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution . i am aware of the efforts made by members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes .    2.8512669157558297
secondly , i must also assert my total conviction that neither spain nor andalusia is xenophobic or racist . of course this does not mean that i do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law , and by the law alone .    2.3649091834740177
we should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner .    2.9660435247309302
these events , which are unfortunately UNK the political decisions in this area , confirm without doubt that the development of the tampere agreements and title iv of the ec treaty must be an urgent priority .    3.147173045018719
today ' s problems cannot be solved in five years .    2.7183909054272446
they will take a long time , as we are finding out .    3.6071692850025197
the legislation of the member states must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in tampere , as paragraph 7 of the motion states .    3.1708267595499287
legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays .    2.17936561676525
furthermore , the labour market must be organised UNK so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages , social security and social protection in terms of equality . this will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people , which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion , and which are the real basis of the current social problem .    2.968059096656635
solidarity , dialogue and agreements between local , regional , national and european institutions and employers , unions and the immigrant communities themselves , whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility , are essential .    2.240518088551671
collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital . in this respect , the action plans approved by the high level group and the tampere european council must be allocated a budget .    3.4206764811843633
specifically , i must stress in this debate the plan for morocco . this is a country with which the european union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration .    3.079700710691187
finally , this house must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and UNK prompted by such behaviour .    2.2392881293940152
this is a very important social debate in the creation of a european area in which the right to freedom , security and justice will be recognised in the future charter of fundamental rights .    3.2519778959846213
the proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this house have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions .    3.0129682190098865
we all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers .    2.1011324898276476
we all , i believe , agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions .    2.6116076475506236
these events certainly have their origin in , among other factors , the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully .    2.1885453001170174
we hope that the events in el ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated .    2.9841317327479118
yet it is not enough to regret the situation .    3.0702066264027814
we do not want africa to become our cross , in fact quite the contrary .    2.858953896746462
we must therefore act .    2.726507999684539
i should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another european region affected by immigration - the canary islands .    2.476663557184474
firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for UNK .    2.376314393335415
secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration .    2.793163970283056
thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect .    2.324496547764685
finally we are producing a census of immigrants .    2.32151654655945
i hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the tampere agreements on immigration and the new spanish act on aliens . in particular they must ensure that people arriving in europe do not lose their dignity .    2.3977528999890687
mr president , last week , in the andalusian town of el ejido , we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the european union in the year 2000 .    2.880531795303394
this was acknowledged by the commission president , romano prodi , on 9 february when he confirmed that what had occurred in el ejido went against the very principles of the european union .    2.5806705218661645
these events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism , xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated .    1.9892407842253537
it is incomprehensible that ways of UNK and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial .    2.4680755236538885
the only way to prevent these events happening again , in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers , is through social integration . this requires a firm economic , political and social commitment from the competent authorities .    2.487044184996967
we are all immigrants .    2.8688770399380403
for generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly UNK .    2.0849870318466386
geographical mobility is not an UNK of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work - related causes .    2.9287082009723338
we are all immigrants , if not ourselves personally , then through one of our relations or UNK .    2.6260445321704435
however , instead of producing these events which we are condemning , migration must generate social , cultural and economic enrichment .    2.543776677540247
what happened in el ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the european union .    2.5852005056096417
we must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of el ejido against immigrant workers in the area . a whole community should not have been held responsible , UNK and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident .    2.3254057510938715
secondly , all the authorities must act immediately . coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism .    2.88381827592864
in particular , local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia , especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property .    2.3399622663190613
these authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these , as has happened with the mayor in question .    2.6425722290132208
thirdly , the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials . they must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the european union .    2.4151378661915333
finally , the european union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles .    3.608401321602258
it must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and UNK with national , regional and local authorities and non - governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles . this must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the eu .    2.571942158226847
mr president , initially our group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon .    2.7325342386137046
however , the incidents in el ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout europe and which deserves our full attention .    2.251093379382567
we thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in europe . yet , over the years , social disintegration in europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance .    2.2546867265304225
this is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in el ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like haider ' s .    2.3742610200394267
this house therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures UNK all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately . we must ensure respect for human rights , tolerance and UNK and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues .    2.9562270434902485
in this respect we must not forget that the original victim ' s UNK was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated .    2.353304110821046
the current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures , as indicated previously .    2.847175469646147
finally , as our nobel prize winner , josé saramago , has said , we are all in each other and as UNK UNK said , although saramago disagreed with this , we should not just love one another , more importantly , we should respect one another .    2.818486733104093
mr president , commissioner , andalusia is one of the most tolerant and UNK regions of the european union .    2.5348040485599714
since time UNK it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as andalusians from day one , whether or not they were born in our region . therefore , as an mep , but primarily as an andalusian , i can feel only UNK , UNK and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community .    2.3487213781780056
yet a worrying situation is apparent .    2.518809649694843
all decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents . i am referring , for example , to the lack of agreement with morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry , part of whose fleet is UNK in almería .    2.888763735776826
i am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and UNK by the eu which is UNK relations between almería and morocco . i am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions , member states and european union which , due to actions or omissions , is leading to a few territories like almería having to support this migratory pressure from north - west africa on their own .    2.729907446965971
all these factors have unfortunately been UNK over time and are now allowing those who are cruel , UNK , racist and destructive , of which all our countries have some examples , but UNK a minority , to light the UNK of xenophobia .    2.784448482309021
anyone , whether european or not , who lives and works in andalusia , is an andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect . the eu can and must speak out .    2.519372302189813
for you , the south is andalusia but for us andalusians it is africa .    2.556366774242776
we must therefore ensure that the eu provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another . this has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way .    2.577735626214661
mr president , commissioner , i speak from experience acquired during many visits to el ejido over the years . i was therefore aware how the situation was developing .    2.0146572189550875
here in the european parliament , as in many other institutions , we have UNK this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened . this is because we felt the problem to be ours , as it was .    3.279767030517649
in el ejido there is a serious social problem , problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the UNK .    2.891517398104185
these events have also acted as a wake - up call to our consciences .    2.277146858352408
here in this house , in spain and in many other countries , we have all fixed on el ejido . yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening , not only in el ejido , but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment .    2.7181890385943834
we all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward . we will not find the guilty parties in this house or in many other places .    3.06372284720615
those responsible for what happened in el ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants . we must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution .    2.659576527844287
these problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there . this therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in el ejido and throughout europe .    2.619725684170335
mr president , this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in spain fighting for human rights .    2.362395624537922
all the spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support .    2.5211096783571967
it was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities ; the democratic system in spain has been held up to UNK , despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years .    2.3216858880401188
employers would be lost without immigrants .    2.6963809110055426
working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no spaniard will accept them .    2.234725495202748
low wages , the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard UNK - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are UNK and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves .    2.537153741887717
what happened at el ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in europe today .    2.7108798372600083
for four days , the immigrants were collectively UNK .    2.4844570097266034
women and children were UNK .    2.993432660862033
fleeing from all quarters , hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a UNK on the UNK of the town .    3.1069482206447647
we are right to UNK haider ' s austria ; but we cannot allow little local UNK to practice policies of racial exclusion and UNK economic UNK .    2.370561674141638
what happened in spain could happen in any country in the union if we are not careful .    3.238754725743238
we all have a duty to put our own house in order .    2.5309585940593218
i support this proposal for a resolution , especially the points which refer to the application of article 13 of the amsterdam treaty , and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the structural funds allocated and the fight against exclusion .    3.126436864399685
it would be to our credit were the european parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in spain and throughout the union are respected .    3.104151041839678
mr president , acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of europe .    2.271529462171002
everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements .    2.3429430138630982
we must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature .    2.2595440765076362
no european society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other .    2.321880602519277
these violent scenes at el ejido are so similar to UNK pictures of UNK in the UNK , when the UNK UNK the black population , that it is hard to tell them apart . they also put us in mind of germany in the 1930s , when the nazis were persecuting the jews .    2.7864767987405163
without wishing to lump everything together UNK , because each period is different , we have failed to learn the lessons of history .    2.661851039036181
that is my conclusion today .    2.5899130693634316
because this UNK hunt which broke out in the province of almería should have been foreseen .    2.701230177078373
it is the result , first and foremost , of the UNK and exploitation of immigrant labour .    3.6027057896636174
three annual crops of moroccan and african workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly eur 2 million ; and yet 60 % of them have no running water in a region where , as we know , the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer .    2.1524255156201484
we also know that many of them only earn eur 30 a month , while their fellow european citizens can earn three times that .    2.2721741633586894
this precarious wage - UNK position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable .    2.1553639291381397
the irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion .    2.3202111830698238
we should counter such acts of terror , mr president , by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere . my fellow member , mrs UNK , was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order .    2.762235285943282
finally , and i think this is important : why not have the honesty today to relay what was UNK in a recent un study explaining that , if spain wishes to preserve its work , retirement and pension potential , it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status ; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year UNK ?    2.5682706700367586
we must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember , to recall the dates in history when our countries UNK on the brink of horror .    2.4163395516218196
we need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come .    2.8979214102169957
it just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on saturday .    2.4759224842103316
we must take to the streets of europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to europe and which lead our youth UNK .    2.316823600270113
mr president , since the signature of the treaty of amsterdam , the european union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia .    3.1229925210703944
two types of measure are required for this purpose . the first should seek the integration of people of non - european origin and the other should aim to organise immigration .    2.6064951016139464
with regard to the first , the commission has sent us a series of proposals , contained in two directives and an action plan , which aim to apply the following decision taken by the heads of state and government in tampere . this states that ' the european union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its member states .    2.8030420808414096
a more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of eu citizens ' . this is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in el ejido where there are irregularities , labour exploitation and indecent living conditions , which have been condemned in the past .    2.6708367692459634
i hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration . i also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in tampere , including spain , will work diligently to apply these .    2.571881571399109
i have less hope about the development of an effective and fair european policy in accordance with the statement made by the council on immigration .    3.4935543481035536
the only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification . this is a key issue , as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in el ejido .    3.8473412146670696
yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments . outside the community arena , some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies .    2.711443204710592
this is occurring in my country , despite the government , the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens .    3.041254078920109
the objective of combating racism and xenophobia , explained in the treaties , should be the objective of all european institutions and politicians .    3.632075855219484
on 28 february 1998 the european political parties , including the spanish popular party , signed the charter of european political parties for a non - racist society .    2.656319076930888
this requires coherent behaviour , yet local leaders of the popular party are throwing more fuel on the UNK fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out .    2.1304568830843644
the party to which the mayor of el ejido belongs should , according to the commitments signed in this charter , act forcefully .    2.5661008257849387
it is only , as stated by mr UNK mollar , through unity , responsibility and UNK that el ejido , spain and europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed .    2.8928180250875006
mr president , one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of UNK , no less , of moroccan day UNK which took place in el ejido .    2.312996097793421
we do not the extent to which far - right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame .    2.1221577683860144
we wish to assure these moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough , they have to suffer this type of aggression .    2.6684888790938195
and if the UNK include working - class people , all we can say to them is that , in acting in this way , they are UNK their own UNK .    3.1505787559765923
in waging war against people who are as poor as they are , they are only doing their own UNK a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves .    2.498393205304993
but there are some who bear even more responsibility than the UNK who UNK the iron UNK and UNK : those who spread racist and xenophobic slander , those who indulge in anti - immigration demagoguery in spain , austria , france or elsewhere , sometimes even here in this house , are no better than those who take this stupid , UNK demagoguery at face value .    2.3575811581491304
the UNK UNK and their extreme right - wing UNK are the mortal enemies not only of the workers , but of society as a whole .    3.0424023776051405
i want to make it clear at the outset that the commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at el ejido against the immigrant workers of the region .    2.783526711323922
we express our support for the families and friends of the victims .    3.2309551548834574
president prodi and commissioner diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements .    2.3987671466421645
it was especially moving to hear the remarks from members of parliament who come from the region about what has happened , UNK , in a part of spain that i know reasonably well .    3.014159028764968
racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our community , wherever they take place .    2.420559391531644
they fly in the face of the very principles on which - as mr havel said yesterday - the european union was founded : principles of liberty , democracy and respect for human rights .    2.7385782531090093
of course progress has been made in recent years but we still have to work together towards a climate of tolerance in which racism and xenophobia are regarded as completely beyond the UNK , completely unacceptable , while at the same time we deal very UNK with incidents such as the ones we are discussing this afternoon .    2.7334735196782565
the european union has already laid the basis for community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race .    2.692154957587132
the insertion of article 13 , which was referred to during the debate , dealing with non - discrimination in the treaty establishing the european community , is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the treaties .    3.154427441856773
since the treaty of amsterdam came into force the commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of article 13 including , in particular , a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin .    3.230169182787181
this proposal is under examination by the council and the european parliament .    3.2989886939910775
the commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete .    2.37795149002547
the conclusions of the tampere special european council , as mr UNK mollar said , clearly illustrated the will of the heads of state and government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based , with particular emphasis on the union ' s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants .    3.278642382168391
at tampere the heads of state and government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the member states as well as the situation in the countries of origin .    3.1513210173486637
the european council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration .    2.664368348999404
its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration , with particular reference to the rights of women and children .    2.9517392337865584
those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour .    2.1931989872931377
the word that is used about them in chinese society is ' snake - heads ' . it seems to me a fitting description of them .    2.100005784381353
let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a european union charter on fundamental rights , which has now reached the drafting stage .    3.519723739050259
the charter will extend to third country nationals in member states even though certain rights will be reserved to nationals of member states of the union .    2.501867128456839
the el ejido incidents were shocking , as several members have said in their speeches .    2.4502013856106224
but trying to take something positive from them , i hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance , fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the european union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it , not at some indefinite moment in the future , but here today .    2.2865677361487364
thank you , commissioner .    2.120450226877885
the joint debate is closed .    2.607557207215761
human rights    3.7853276173549655
mr president , before we start the debate on kosovo or mitrovica , i must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me .    2.4352994215058272
indeed , it is not the first time that we will be debating kosovo here .    3.7035745225515084
we have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot , as nothing is actually done with them .    2.338753256462763
i certainly appreciate the fact that commissioner patten is present , given his powers .    2.689707161114527
but i - and many members with me - also have to note that the council is consistently absent from this debate .    3.0307105342280605
we need to cooperate with the council too .    3.3595689976544416
i see that a UNK from the council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the council but , for the rest , nothing will get done .    3.1861775893702076
i would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the council should be present during the topical debate , so that we can enter into direct consultation with the council .    2.902226247189314
i would request you to pass this complaint on to the bureau of parliament .    2.465637671109617
mr president , commissioner , we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons .    2.671047257448673
first , because mr sakellariou , who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom i shall not quote , vehemently UNK it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender .    2.2082353829421724
i have no doubt , and i am sure that you have no doubt , that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance .    3.483926929028801
the other reason is that this text does not , unfortunately , go very far .    3.19261550269648
i think that it manages , through a series of clever UNK , to carefully avoid addressing the central issue , i . e . the final status of kosovo .    2.5425087534135415
i doubt that any of you still believe that kosovo can one day become part of yugoslavia .    2.482145462542443
i also doubt that any of you can believe that milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of kosovo .    2.2350410108026417
i also doubt that any of you think that , as things stand , it is not in milosevic ' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise kosovo , as he is doing and as we have seen .    3.2171560185394354
finally , i do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to kosovo .    2.6922971922949395
i also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution , which you no doubt overlooked .    2.75363946162547
you condemn the first direct attack on the kfor troops .    2.3519015502718656
i would not want you to be birds of ill omen , but i fear that , by failing to confront the real issue , you will end up being just that and i shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen .    2.7240791431564033
on the contrary , i think it is our duty to call on the commission and the council , which unfortunately is not present , to insist that the united nations consider the question of the final status of kosovo , of the multiplicity of micro - states in the region , of what happens post - dayton and , finally , the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the european union a policy in this region .    3.335564794505376
finally , i would stress that we have been asking the council and the commission since july to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 kosovar prisoners and mrs brovina , mr UNK and mr UNK .    2.8801607251060726
i note that the union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange .    3.3563127090259726
why not ?    2.9864373439465504
mr president , what is happening in mitrovica in kosovo is appalling and reprehensible .    2.5917764604851214
violence begets violence , and revenge begets revenge .    2.311829424972548
the police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on .    3.014711025494625
the chief commissioner of police , UNK UNK , has expressed his UNK at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed .    2.680152005330357
he has fewer than 2 000 officers , and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000 .    2.8752572587347416
the police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence , so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities . it should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them .    3.284523918804
otherwise , there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands . it is therefore also important that local officers should be trained , and the idea was , in fact , that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained .    2.7417529947377544
however , there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime . a year ago , we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up .    2.4546083284637636
i was in kosovo on 27 october 1998 when the serbs withdrew .    2.2509060974384534
the agreement was that 1 800 osce observers should arrive to guarantee the peace .    2.3033405840855945
after a month , however , there was still only a handful of observers .    3.5466118528095416
by christmas , there were perhaps 100 and , by the spring , still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was , in fact , in place .    2.5810767174147022
atrocities were not even being recorded .    2.7086436538145526
then the war came , and the observers were withdrawn .    3.000281002015185
i would therefore ask the commissioner : can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our UNK here in europe ?    2.7568862583014204
can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers , who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad ?    1.9780854627001043
i might also ask : when do you anticipate that they will be in place ?    2.9073096385760464
and when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities ?    2.394534030824724
i mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all .    2.934039790116774
all who are in contact with real life in kosovo share the same opinion : it is a tragic , desperate situation where there is a democratic UNK and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side . mitrovica is a tragic example of this .    2.7097591564082046
but nato ' s decision for military intervention and the kla ' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced kosovo to a UNK , as well as destroying civil infrastructures in serbia .    2.789486592554599
today , kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups , and these include not only serbs and roma , but also moderate albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power .    2.4063005574879113
it is useless to talk of the roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from UNK , who are now living , UNK in , in kosovo , abandoned by the UNK , which itself has been abandoned by the donors , while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions .    2.7969982120317893
in the joint resolution , we ask the council and the member states to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures , giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence .    2.922790871855497
in this sense , i am in agreement with mr sakellariou ' s proposals .    3.1113620378854203
another subject being discussed is the release of the albanians held in prisons , particularly flora brovina , a woman of extraordinary humanity whom i met , together with the women in black of belgrade , during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups .    1.9914302187307347
flora defended herself , and asked serbs and albanians to shake hands .    2.1434055418950813
flora brovina ' s UNK is the guest of serbian women in belgrade .    2.693917930582614
this is a sign of hope , the hope that it possible to act differently even in serbia .    3.0222194082209053
it is not true that flora brovina has been abandoned .    2.4296348779612416
she might well have been abandoned by the large institutions , but we , who worked in kosovo and serbia for many years , are doing our utmost to campaign for her release .    2.568651213949107
i believe that the european union must do likewise .    3.200904154227352
the embargo on serbia must be lifted and serbia must , in turn , release its political prisoners .    2.412183186421786
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to fully endorse mrs pack ' s very UNK - charged contribution .    2.2541153154488414
what she has said here is completely justified .    2.5055085761213403
i completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us .    2.5447654351390123
we condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do , but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse .    3.544387808350598
needless to say , the situation in mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why .    3.0626205917841856
there are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the UNK mines also plays its part .    2.2598930496617813
we have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners .    3.2662788383848262
there is a great deal of pain , a lot of suffering in kosovo .    2.8236437893352955
the people are holding demonstrations , they are sending us e - UNK .    2.7040245557449007
they ask us where their children are , their sons .    2.2660462718009446
we need to be able to go back with a proper answer .    2.8828379953021055
the case of flora brovina is just one of many .    3.1862900681255173
we are right to include this in the draft resolution , but there are hundreds , even thousands of flora UNK out there .    2.8849079068003673
i would ask the commission and the absent council at long last to do something for these political prisoners .    2.8935122834021993
the fact that they are locked up in serbia also fuels the UNK and violence in kosovo .    3.1048585269343234
mr president , in the present joint draft resolution , paragraph 10 urges the council and member states - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the un police units .    2.887525952270207
this request is fully in line with the vision held by the special representative of the un in kosovo , mr bernard kouchner .    2.9084533608647187
in order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in kosovo , he needs , by his own UNK , at least 6 000 foreign police officers .    2.484916553156749
the un , however , have pledged to UNK a police force of 4 800 .    3.1064466272555
to date , however , mr kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal .    2.612920463575132
moreover , half of this group is from the united states and germany .    3.0768699166589175
it is logical that the special representative of the un in kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation , especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region .    2.8111168090962155
what is UNK , however , is mr kouchner ' s sharp criticism levelled at the french government these days .    2.955070463301914
paris is leaving its fellow - countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen , not more than 37 , in the crisis region .    2.3978183487681557
for this hardly honourable position , mr kouchner UNK none other than the minister for home affairs , mr chevènement .    2.5308715992025723
according to mr kouchner , the minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the french police officials on ideological grounds .    2.710343949670847
i would ask the council and the commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the european parliament of the outcome .    3.2970863377494575
press freedom in angola    3.404586562872656
mr president , i do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity .    2.243504340770766
on the question of angola , i think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last .    3.192520611348059
it would be the first in a long time .    3.165918086194037
so i welcome it as such .    2.7418522621303922
i think that the european union and the western world in general has had mr savimbi in their UNK for some time now , with no discrimination whatsoever , but corruption is now so rife in mr dos santos ' s regime that even his long - standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything .    2.1982158676170145
so i think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter , especially the worrying things which we are discussing , particularly logistics support for the information services by the united states and great britain , generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely ' UNK ' matters which we need to go into .    3.0170961031319963
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the european parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the european union .    2.736420716290116
clearly , governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial , geostrategic or economic interests .    2.232164095573495
we have established requirements for the countries which want to join our union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support , because we believe in democracy and its values .    3.162687696949666
a free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy .    2.2558224565250926
there can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion .    2.4551181596204725
yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted , UNK , threatened or put under pressure .    2.1157821538003905
we rightfully condemned the behaviour of unita which threatened the peace process in angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace . rightfully and with the full weight of our authority , we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the government of angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society .    2.2498144278843437
mr president , how much longer can we continue our cooperation with angola ?    2.351936661880556
human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time , not only by unita , but also by the government itself .    3.1224248619358
the legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle .    2.389485355168676
the angolan government must immediately authorise a substantial un presence which can mediate and can report on human rights .    2.125391955559511
additionally , european observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists .    2.6963224900088107
europe , as a major donor , has so far remained too passive with regard to angola .    3.2382242470039193
if the angolan government continues to refuse to cooperate , measures will need to be taken .    2.988559882353173
without national reconciliation , reconciliation with europe is not possible .    2.87501858897683
this being the case , angola will unfortunately remain a very UNK diamond .    2.4150855718295468
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this house . the repression of both angolan and foreign journalists in angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment .    2.233460436695207
however , this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them .    2.1993481150154093
yet this is not the situation .    3.7934330514627757
angola does not enjoy rule of law . it is a repressive dictatorship .    3.3715114640031656
it is at war , and a bloody war at that , which is dragging on and on .    3.0825427044985156
the prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept .    2.4778047567005546
the repeated appeals made by the angolan church and , for example , by mr UNK and mr UNK , for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this house .    3.2146832542291457
as another member said , we must have a general debate on angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country .    3.0229864177106105
for example , i have today received information directly from UNK UNK , whose situation we are discussing , according to which two UNK from portuguese television have been imprisoned in angola .    2.6821444571602933
these cases keep occurring .    2.73792496997685
yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in angola .    3.5646932485262774
the silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption , violence and war .    2.2378646880695934
i must draw attention to the fact that the war in angola is spreading to other parts of africa .    2.985764116179612
it is impacting on the war in the democratic republic of the congo and on the situations in namibia and zambia . it is now also affecting the situation in zimbabwe where robert UNK has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the congo to UNK up UNK UNK who is beyond salvation .    2.3655013873896036
there are two sides in angola or rather two armed groups .    2.289240680412557
the first is the mpla , which controls the oil profits . the second is the armed UNK of mr savimbi , which controls the diamond profits .    2.0709697798998916
it is oil and UNK which are financing the continuation of the war which , as has been said , is terrible . it has displaced millions of people and caused them to go UNK .    2.901042618387522
this war must be stopped .    2.8323459236692994
the authority of this house could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the angolan situation and also on the whole of southern africa .    3.995073231711016
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom . it is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes .    2.7143116580160456
the problem considered by the motion is a major one but , as has already been touched upon , could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster .    2.880414598590552
this situation , as in neighbouring former UNK , is like a UNK wound in which it is not clear who is UNK whom . as mr soares just said , a truly terrible situation is developing in angola and in other countries in the region .    2.946334096047495
this was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the first world war of africa , given the involvement of certain countries in others .    2.7494864630059257
it is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in angola .    2.345998800677225
we have experienced this in our own national and european history . people can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant .    2.4925367177741977
the cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace , although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible .    2.5252758411601293
like a previous speaker , i also fully support the appeals which have been made .    3.3227246849967487
we must , some time soon , find the courage to tackle the whole angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously .    2.3571412972160153
in recent years , the behaviour of unita has UNK our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the angolan state for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people .    2.1432537939101257
we must establish dialogue with other forces in angola , be attentive to the appeals of the angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions , national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war . these can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades .    1.9892914695417385
the people of angola deserve better .    2.9824639567381777
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it seems as if the world is turned upside down .    2.2488313593813474
journalists are sent to prison for simply speaking the truth , whilst soldiers who are supposedly fighting each other exchange smuggled goods in the bar in the evening .    2.0517481646284432
this is angola ' s reality .    2.3886775465007424
we are now expressing our horror concerning this war .    2.299249092963515
three million victims , two million driven from their homes within the country ' s borders , hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders , including women and children .    2.2161537410002268
the government too is responsible for this continuing violence . this is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds .    2.608613035467684
we would , at the same time , like to insist on other things .    3.111645341298234
we want the un embargo , which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being UNK across to unita airports , to stop .    2.5217815723701995
but what do these sanctions mean ?    2.5465734647140557
it is the western world itself which is partly to blame .    2.563243937521985
it is we , our own people , who keep the war going over there .    2.5701201959963
the so - called civilised world should UNK its head in shame .    2.451982017016006
this is also the case for the so - called statutory government which is just as guilty , because if this journalist has accused the president himself of deriving benefit from this civil war , then all he is doing is UNK what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across africa .    2.2888147463581423
mr president , we are partly to blame for this war .    2.6575614371299525
we should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war .    2.406623426567074
mr president , the facts are well - known .    2.7649218705265666
on 24 december , the angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the portuguese paper , UNK , to a year ' s imprisonment and a fine of usd 20 000 .    2.654672587504925
the journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the president ' s cabinet .    2.216023535735446
the trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness .    2.101221680855902
another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the mpla government party .    2.4136077925846657
these are only two examples of a trend in angola to silence any government critics .    2.163509693760298
over the past year , more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security .    2.2614326888789122
their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along , namely the large - scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars , paid by the oil companies to the angolan government .    2.266952389499902
even the british minister , peter UNK , conceded this recently . we should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government , he told president dos santos last month .    2.147109608442044
but , at the same time , we note that great britain and also portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government .    2.5801363144893394
there is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding angola .    2.819888329726558
on the basis of a report , the human rights organisation global witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of dos santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts .    2.5096130489088173
i would like to challenge portugal to deliver proof to the contrary , by making commercial interests UNK to human rights , to which so much lip service is being paid .    2.5738213431761157
in my opinion , angola is a test case .    2.3010779715964413
we should , at any rate , judge the portuguese presidency on its actions and not on its words .    2.729312056458148
native americans in the us - dineh    3.25829261460243
mr president , the american leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the indians and other indigenous peoples .    2.2289582315473035
we have to admit that our european sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect .    2.773378139389325
once again , an indigenous people ' s right of existence is being threatened .    2.709873439376226
once again , the individuality , dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest .    2.245828485626234
once again , we are losing a piece of our planet ' s cultural and ecological heritage , despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights , on the protection of minorities , rights of indigenous peoples , etc . , which have already been ratified .    3.3923890902235945
if tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperatives at all , we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the peoples concerned .    2.8494428349289604
but if we are to believe the environmental movements , even this is vain hope .    2.4611668753335625
there are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been UNK to the so - called new lands .    3.190996887309682
it very much remains to be seen whether these new lands will be safe in terms of public health .    2.6219147527977555
it is of key importance that the american authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a UNK alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life .    2.366139826538522
it is also important that a debate is held where the long - term effects of mining in this region are discussed and UNK up in economic , ecological and social terms .    2.474199789082783
the credibility of the industrialised north is at stake .    2.508722950466346
indeed , what right do we have to demand of developing countries that they give their minorities a voice , that they protect their valuable natural areas and that they respect human rights , if it UNK that we are unable to meet these demands in our own countries ?    3.2551520691467926
mr president , as mr van hecke rightly pointed out , this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples , and parliament must speak up , especially vis - à - vis good friends , and the united states is a good friend .    3.4436944496672
this is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time .    2.5682237419426364
it is up to the european parliament to protect vulnerable people .    3.3146784665108333
so we need to do this .    3.842275396667352
this is also about respecting a culture , a language , a way of life and a people ' s religion , a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared .    2.48442284849019
it is important to point this out .    2.5665551562584827
we have just approved the water directive here in parliament .    2.6887127119351453
the water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being UNK by a mining company , and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened .    2.689657512191214
the forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally .    2.4961821524556274
people should no longer be forced to move .    3.1347778720283026
over the past 25 years , no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop .    2.77737387018423
if people need to move at all , they need to be given a viable alternative .    3.281633381863905
this is not the case here .    2.862445821917215
the area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable .    3.159028964594252
this is why i think that we as european parliament need to ask the american authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and , if necessary , abandon the scheme altogether .    2.6975458854603738
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this is my maiden speech and i am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights .    2.5602629018717526
in terms of human rights , europe has a very UNK past and this is why we have become to some extent the UNK of these human rights .    3.993335636022659
we need to continue to stand up for these rights , especially in our own member states and societies , but also elsewhere .    3.7045500506671796
as mr UNK said , we certainly need to do this vis - à - vis the united states which , after all , is close to us in terms of democratic values .    3.3416503118201084
the treatment of the native americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights .    2.794559854142828
the account of the dineh indians is telling .    3.1939698996686796
the area in UNK which is to be the new land for the dineh indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in us history .    2.6221418646266446
it is now the intention to send the last 4 000 dineh indians to this land .    2.314908074078797
this too is characteristic of american society , which hears little about it .    2.2287828977415653
they get UNK up about wars and genocide on other UNK , but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country .    2.3869498455832514
today , the dineh indians are facing their final fight for their right to land , for their right to dignity and , above all , for their right to their way of life .    2.5803356518145617
there are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful , economic UNK .    2.4263751963539013
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers , but i would like to emphasise a few things .    3.1393655695839278
the dineh people belong to the north - american navajo indians .    2.701891838464838
they are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years .    2.122674675388232
they have been living in harrowing living conditions for years .    2.5058726370518816
the deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries .    2.4111691190815834
the relocation act , which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re - distribute the land of the navajo reservation , authorised the relocation of the peoples .    2.325878036315536
this relocation is , of course , unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic , social and cultural terms .    2.6271128610831083
the dineh indians are being moved like pawns and , in that way , lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their UNK - but also any prospect of work and sources of income .    2.5216657091869195
the relocation act was pushed through in congress by a group representing the coal mining industry .    2.0204736495574043
congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives .    2.8809465429644727
the population was not allowed any input .    2.4601711187784843
this resembles a kind of trade in human beings .    2.9569078220265705
the relocation scheme was implemented and the dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium .    2.206400600760254
after the collapse of the dam in new mexico in 1979 , which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium , this place is one of the world ' s most contaminated areas .    2.1610789376702906
the united states administration , the coal industry and all of us need to UNK ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative : either the soil is cleaned or the dineh indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support , be it in the psychological , social , cultural or budgetary field .    2.365403817715721
it is high time we respected the rights of the indians .    2.611247972310141
this is why we ask you to vote for this resolution : we in europe should not be UNK by american interests which are being pushed by financial , religious and industrial groups .    2.820381361211652
so let us contact the united states now !    3.1435542694513385
madam president , despite the protests by the international press , we still do not know the fate of mr andrey babitsky , the courageous russian journalist who has worked intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of chechnya and the destruction of the city of grozny .    2.2488928781778172
among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given , there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over mr babitsky ' s fate , by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with chechen fighters which , inter alia , if this did actually take place , would constitute a breach of international law , which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances .    2.638899629440422
nevertheless , we now have more precise information : we know that the acting russian president himself , mr vladimir putin , asked russian special services to safeguard andrey babitsky ' s life and freedom .    2.1774249147309805
this is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes parliament ' s position on the case all the more appropriate , as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence .    2.2582786494625204
moreover , we are asking the russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so - called detention centres , and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention , maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity .    2.1418077117167638
we would ask the council and the commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights .    3.092787641390679
mr president , in terms of human rights , there is of course a great deal amiss in chechnya .    3.804788896157157
we have received reports from human rights organisations saying that russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - i am talking about old men and women - in grozny .    2.295979608102044
citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air - UNK UNK .    2.7725096626293246
we insist that these violations of human rights are investigated .    3.0119956522941402
despite the pledges made , violations in , for example , UNK have still not been investigated .    2.8792284871998075
international government organisations and non - governmental organisations must be allowed access , and the union ' s general council decided on 6 december 1999 to send representatives from the member states to ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there . i am , to say the least , curious to know how they are getting on .    2.978104215431532
the fate of andrey babitsky , the correspondent in grozny of radio liberty , who was arrested by russian troops , is a dramatic example of russian policy .    2.243245556410987
it contravenes article 3 of the geneva convention of UNK and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press .    3.3297713353762397
we want information from the russian authorities as to mr babitsky ' s UNK and his state of health .    2.7277737476600135
yet he is taken hostage and treated as a UNK of war .    3.0411573006695822
the war in chechnya , like any war , is a trail of horrors .    2.7799335410204713
the filtration camps are camps in which torture , rape and violations are perpetrated : we know that now .    2.127228370934471
and just what is mr cfsp doing ?    2.626215195256672
russia is a permanent member of the un security council and a full member of the council of europe and the osce , it has been invited to g7 and is a client of the imf and the world bank .    3.129178476406549
what are we doing about it ?    2.5362476674874386
i do not understand why the power centres of europe are keeping quiet , letting things pass and , by working with the russians as if nothing were amiss , giving its support to the government which is waging this war .    2.245291519447266
i beg you to intervene .    2.663493514377333
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the tragic case of the courageous russian journalist andrey babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which russia has sunk .    1.9704777276880365
the entire federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda .    2.7640207661436653
a UNK has become president and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters .    2.2276849852242178
journalists , on the other hand , who are simply going about their work in russia , i . e . endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible , are being treated like criminals .    2.8420873076559117
i can only reiterate my appeal to the council and the commission to stick to the rules .    3.3324473382001867
it is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the eu if it does not recognise democratic principles .    2.801389283654943
mr president , what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as ' terrorists ' and ' UNK ' ?    2.3622029345945648
without any hesitation , the russian minister for internal affairs , vladimir UNK , earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question .    2.226067608379026
the victim of this exchange is said to be the 35 - year - old war correspondent of radio free europe / radio liberty , andrey babitsky .    2.2742569244778443
i am using the phrase ' is said to be ' on purpose , because official chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged mr babitsky for a number of russian prisoners of war .    2.147543554966544
in the meantime , the highest russian authorities are casting a UNK of UNK over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist .    2.4526100023823076
for example , acting president vladimir putin gave an assurance last monday that he had ordered the country ' s security services to bring the missing UNK back to moscow safely .    2.224984048998372
russia ' s new strong man , however , added a rather UNK comment to this welcome declaration : ' as far as i am aware , mr babitsky already feels free . '    2.6250168984900957
this distressing ambiguity on the part of the kremlin is not really surprising .    2.794399082973835
the facts are clear .    3.0872952813305243
andrey babitsky was an unwanted UNK in mr putin ' s ' anti - terrorist ' operation in chechnya .    2.0778743977410494
hence his disappearance of over one month .    2.4656787472542865
in any case , the babitsky affair warrants one conclusion : the leaders in moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage - taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically chechen crime .    1.813431708236332
this resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the chechen tragedy .    2.4377435702253196
nor is it a mere luxury .    2.7307821834082384
indeed , it is in line with some thirty russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on andrey babitsky free of charge .    2.2780616622649537
cambodia    4.486654657805862
mr president , commissioner , it is because of my experience in the balkans , when i was there on duty , that i call on you today to support the efforts of the secretary - general of the united nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the united nations .    2.6707844587717444
i do not think that reconciliation is possible after such UNK tragedies , unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced .    2.125170997901992
nor do i think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial .    2.9631863775582565
i became convinced of this in UNK when i had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement , none of which unfortunately lasted , between the parties to the conflict .    2.0828366514231362
every time , just as the exchange was about to take place , we found men missing from the UNK drawn up lists .    2.8387618196454385
every time , when we asked why , the reply was the same , ' we cannot release him : he is a war criminal ' .    2.5523992937325226
in the UNK , pain and fury of the agreements , it was impossible to break the UNK circle of blood and vengeance .    2.5723592556129335
if we want to help the cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked , we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus UNK the simple UNK and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them .    2.676007478729009
i expect UNK UNK and his main UNK to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the united nations .    2.70483499230276
this will be the only way for the cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace .    2.849110057155403
mr president , it became known this week that two prominent cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have UNK the king and prime minister .    2.0609123795614273
these papers actively support the opposition politician , mr sam rengie .    2.1797668666875816
legal proceedings have been initiated against sam rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason .    2.3893017606043983
in his millennium speech , he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to king UNK in the event of his death .    2.8027230021371
in march of last year , a member of sam rengie ' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of UNK .    2.6998363007568287
in september , two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a UNK attack on the prime minister .    3.319066894140007
this is notably the only party in cambodia which has no military arm .    2.1333098057321545
in october , a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by UNK men and not released until the UNK was paid .    2.4275642548905445
the pattern of intimidation is clear .    2.553393865814049
there is more going on in cambodia : prisoners are being tortured , the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children , and people are held on UNK to an excessive degree .    2.3801929796765733
all this is happening on a daily basis .    2.9299660134285026
even more serious is the government ' s refusal to bring the leaders of the khmer rouge before an international tribunal .    2.5378807461941326
it is true , the civil war in cambodia is over and political tension has UNK .    2.1995739295018786
the way in which the political opposition is now being treated , however , gives us cause for great concern and , if it carries on like this , it is bound to impact on the union ' s relations with cambodia .    3.4069572169811835
mr president , there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law , according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes , and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights , not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected .    2.7226243830186743
living examples of this have been the pinochet - UNK case , kosovo and , in UNK form in our own union , the debate surrounding the government decision in austria .    2.9963704887225826
this is what is at stake now in cambodia unless the leaders of the previous UNK regime are bought to justice .    2.4897081305410147
at the same time , the struggle against impunity is under threat .    2.29129476881564
the situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the treaty for an international criminal court has been UNK slow .    2.8663496958000527
i am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - kosovo , angola , chechnya and cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge .    3.1190785764970723
first of all , on kosovo , the commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards kosovo , as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in serb UNK .    2.7712494721102816
our efforts in kosovo , as elsewhere in the wider region , are directed at short and medium - term recovery and long - term stabilisation .    2.875069295038056
in particular we support the development of a free , democratic and multi - ethnic society .    3.0754365681749194
our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and , in particular , to try to build confidence between the various communities .    3.3705566076778037
we have always condemned ethnic violence , no matter which ethnic group is the UNK or the victim .    2.611938076513396
we consider it is unacceptable against serb and roma minorities as it was against the kosovar albanians in the past .    2.3831426085779985
we support the efforts of unmik , kfor and the osce to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order .    2.6394906673406484
in this regard we strongly support the high representative ' s recent appeal to member states to provide more police officers for the un civil police mission in kosovo .    2.530650080404818
it was a point raised by several speakers in the debate .    2.9631196189515365
i hope it will underline the importance , when we address the development of a common foreign and security policy , of looking at the non - military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects .    2.9337875277363827
we continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in serb prisons .    2.9316329481852055
i totally agree with the points put so passionately by the mrs pack , either before trial or following judgement .    2.1406119595816344
the plight of kosovar albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing .    2.8641510479100165
we call on everyone , within and outside kosovo , to support these common aims , to support unmik and kfor in their efforts to achieve them .    2.5323153923039836
turning briefly to angola , we had again a number of UNK speeches , especially from mr soares , with his UNK knowledge of the subject .    2.7098503970320986
the commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in angola .    2.141318637532466
it is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society .    2.40042430612287
an area of special concern is the harassment of journalists , including temporary detention of members of the so - called independent press .    2.6996056466369396
the european union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the angolan ministry of justice in november last year .    2.35747040126633
we fully support the work of the un through UNK , given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in angola .    2.9917416005006907
we are also committed to the security council ' s sanctions against unita , including arms controls .    2.697477718544357
while maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs , the commission is preparing for a post - conflict phase in our financial support for angola .    2.7472791875617064
an essential element will be support for democracy and human rights , including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society .    2.5870858029491792
the resolution i would love to have a debate on in parliament one day is on demining , and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines : stocks in the ukraine , stocks in moldova and stocks elsewhere .    2.376904619866684
this is a subject which is not given sufficient attention .    3.172489988740628
on the question of the indigenous peoples in the us , i am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the us authorities will have been noted by them .    2.8466394658979857
our general policy however , is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society , something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with north america .    2.985301820833322
the commission shares the growing concern about the missing russian journalist , mr babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in chechnya more generally .    2.4097888234666534
this issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in chechnya , and i have heard mr posselt on this subject before .    2.7304629172674817
there are alarming reports of human rights violations .    2.8358958176630127
of course , there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict .    3.066427213679995
the commission delegation in moscow participated in a european union troika démarche on the UNK of this month .    2.8405121770534985
we underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the russians to clarify the circumstances of mr babitsky ' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights .    2.4711259513293915
we await a proper response from the russians .    2.5390548347840314
in the meantime , the conclusions of the general affairs council earlier this week have confirmed the message which i have given today .    2.806735579438242
and we are ready to return to the issue at the eu - russia ministerial troika in lisbon on 2 march , if we need to do so .    3.4112233822400975
finally , on cambodia and the khmer rouge : we strongly agree that senior khmer rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes .    2.0291027776496007
i totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by mr UNK .    3.08853883782166
we vigorously supported the troika démarche to foreign minister UNK UNK on 4 february this year .    2.1105181567724136
the european union underlined its full support for the efforts of the united nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former khmer rouge leaders .    3.163443254133743
at the same time , we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties .    2.808825169659214
i am encouraged by the optimism of UNK UNK , secretary - general of the un , on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal .    3.315570255975651
the commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law , democratic principles and human rights with cambodian authorities through the ec - cambodia cooperation agreement which entered into force on 1 november last year .    2.2827477437868002
it has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days .    2.4321137277626566
i hope we have other opportunities , but i hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead .    2.7191858625413183
thank you very much commissioner patten .    2.318282792994994
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place at 6 . 00 p . m .    1.9069860698128644
danube environmental disaster    3.556153896319288
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :    2.1588552386927007
b5 - UNK / 2000 by mr leinen on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists ,    2.4852759271705342
b5 - 0167 / 2000 by mr UNK and mrs thors on behalf of the group of the european democrat and reform party ,    2.9138630870057574
b5 - 0168 / 2000 by mr UNK and mrs grossetête on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and the european democrats ,    2.6065147987115607
b5 - UNK / 2000 by mr papayannakis and mr sjöstedt on behalf of the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left ,    2.3498349229826743
b5 - UNK / 2000 by mrs schroedter and others on behalf of the group of the greens / european free alliance    2.476650719283967
on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a romanian UNK into the lepos , somes , tisza and danube rivers .    2.1015932686400975
mr president , we debated the framework directive on water this week , and the disaster in romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water .    3.103658661123959
this disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a european union .    3.1013273294369093
we therefore welcome commissioner wallström ' s brief visit , for it can contribute to this awareness .    2.4290310648404576
after all , this is a candidate country we are talking about , and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the eu environmental rules in time .    3.285255845841641
the polluter ought to pay .    2.912365373315326
i wonder whether the european union can UNK this kind of cost from the environmental UNK who appear in the so - called ' wild east ' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place .    2.836390705472364
i would be in favour of its doing so .    3.1513614019699983
mr president , commissioner , there has been one ecological disaster after another and , unfortunately , they are all similar .    2.792474033765586
once again , there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important UNK in europe .    2.5617463748909124
the delta of the danube is in danger .    3.056561799610056
as in spain in april 1998 , as in brittany and the vendée since last december , once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat .    2.3793133406687317
the european parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger , which threatens our environment , UNK our ecosystem and again weakens our populations .    2.2918598414808513
this new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries .    2.8734931472454335
the authorities in these counties , which are still very UNK from an environmental point of view , need to overcome numerous obstacles .    2.9871960135329343
first , they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites ; then they need to have suitable technical means of UNK and containing this type of pollution and , finally , they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites .    3.0415018227809902
today , the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted , which is why the european union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with community environmental protection standards .    2.82411708594392
but , over and above that , it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question .    2.758233569087195
i hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility .    2.304530815856092
the environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the european continent .    3.6496339233468893
it must form the basis for our partners ' political will .    2.7588266751957886
implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop , it will also have social and economic benefits and , at the same time , public health standards will improve .    2.8894057157797706
the european continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the ' polluter pays ' principle .    2.470306744262394
mr president , when the doñana disaster occurred , the non - governmental organisation , the world wide fund for nature , gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in europe .    2.796578944893508
the number is huge . they are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply , ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas .    2.1439376937335153
i visited doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture , fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised .    2.3255157761761036
i therefore believe that the european union must , to start with , carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in europe .    3.1901523917120773
we must bring these reservoirs under community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again .    3.134502119444546
if we do not , we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent .    2.7831727044358154
mr president , this disaster at the mine in romania affects a large UNK area with rivers and watercourses in romania , hungary , serbia and bulgaria , the fact that 100 000 UNK of cyanide - UNK water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come , as well as for animal and plant life , agriculture , the tourist industry , biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem .    2.493955875940268
it is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today .    2.461706597470486
is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals ?    2.6703222165977993
the answer , of course , is an emphatic no .    3.355812015363791
there must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide .    2.4763947589624915
i assume , therefore , that the eu will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total , worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance .    3.2045648176007164
it has already been banned in most eu countries for a long time now .    2.8149073523975594
that an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs .    2.3986900435273126
i have been informed that the commissioner for the environment , margot wallström , has travelled from strasbourg to romania in order to see for herself , on the spot , what has happened .    3.138206452752068
my group assumes that margot wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected : economic aid , support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning - up operation which is required .    2.4118606579328374
this highlights the need for something which we in the group of the greens / european free alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time , namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type .    2.5587118278189807
it also UNK light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant states .    2.967803568606023
we must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people ' s health and the ecosystems .    2.5473959012689944
mr president , i do not think we are in a position to throw stones at the eastern european countries which have come knocking at the door of the european union , because ecological disasters occur as much here , in the west , as they do in the east .    3.0789303182171923
for example , the UNK from the UNK basins at the gold mines in UNK , in france , have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today .    2.904212037927937
we know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions .    2.116197157768212
who is going to pay ?    3.5442467626660066
which is why the environmental aspect , which is becoming a matter of urgency , must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs .    3.3255994439664
i too should like to ask the european union to put its own house in order here , i . e . to call on member states which still have gold mines to commission expert reports , so that we know just what the situation is .    3.0912923675791606
i am thinking in particular of the gold mines in french UNK , where the workers , who are generally women , are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions .    2.3329987923467335
. let me associate myself , not least as a former environment minister , completely and without any reservation whatsoever , with the expressions of concern by honourable members .    2.5018097133523063
an objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage .    3.1388834247626827
but early reports suggest that the poisoning of the lepos , tisza , somes and danube rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy .    2.172537488490345
it has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days .    2.561157420845955
no living organisms , from UNK to UNK , have been spared .    3.653113949158892
several members have set out what seems to have happened .    2.747937861149658
we have all seen some of the consequences on our television UNK .    2.952613020536069
some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster , at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned , on a par with chernobyl .    3.0353943503641307
it has affected the peoples of three countries - romania , hungary and yugoslavia .    2.3538342504514427
as with all such disasters it is the long - term consequences that are the most pernicious .    3.061734136216994
some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to UNK the river .    3.1096249655744197
there is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish .    2.1961685712744186
we plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can , as rapidly as we can , to help cope with this catastrophe .    2.994087841232769
that is certainly the view of my colleague , commissioner wallström , who i know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today .    2.769147094212563
the reason she cannot do so is because , as some honourable members have pointed out , she is in hungary and romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the UNK and romanian authorities to tackle the crisis .    2.829893913762044
we stand ready to do so .    2.690276774795546
we contacted the romanian government and the international commission for the protection of the danube river about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently .    2.675330178900885
the UNK have approached UNK and UNK , in geneva , for an assessment of the damage in the danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts .    2.993077891720307
we stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from hungary and romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed . that is obviously crucial .    2.548558503025741
it is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it .    2.574846411634644
it is to that end that our efforts are now engaged .    2.719122743710733
there is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the romanian authorities .    2.959538748406424
this is an important point , as several speakers have suggested .    2.6284425475965425
the polluter - pays principle is a cornerstone of european union environmental policy .    2.6037636617763407
it is mirrored in the international convention for the protection and sustainable use of the danube river and it should be applied in this case .    3.51056990087377
the european union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due .    2.266388606832626
the union has mobilised some eur 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the danube river basin .    2.5863640772153595
in the context of pre - accession aid to the region it may be possible to UNK some of the assistance we are giving under UNK and phare to tackle the most severe impact of this accident , as long as the polluter - pays principle is fully respected .    2.936692871385851
we will want , in the longer term , to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster , above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place .    3.1999424632351228
the incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of european civil protection , along the lines suggested by president prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two members today .    2.390031078089513
but for now the priority is to cope with this crisis .    2.743647101502139
as i have said , my colleague , commissioner wallström , is on the spot today .    2.9079663678970293
she will want to keep parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit .    2.5814078031407615
this has been an appalling tragedy for europe and europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to UNK our future .    2.564926285020148
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
we shall now proceed to the vote .    2.0168894393738306
vote    3.1522193301854244
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) the only reason we voted for the pse - verts / ale - gue / ngl compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the goodyear - UNK management to close its factory in italy .    2.115252050648266
however , the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and UNK unemployment .    2.9983595597923403
moreover , it is all just words , because the socialist governments , which are now in a majority in europe , are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right - wing governments .    3.3245495170262336
the real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures , but banning them .    2.2012511327369797
the only way of stopping the UNK machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit , on pain of compulsory purchase , and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public .    2.620251729305422
society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners . the first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment .    2.4247074243617313
the sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone , without cutting wages , must be taken from the profits of large companies .    2.392597199095851
it is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders .    2.4615433701188514
. ( sv ) i cannot support the present resolution because , in paragraph 8 , an individual factory in italy is singled out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place , while the current management is being advised to try to sell the factory to a european UNK manufacturer .    2.3764446709957596
it is not the european parliament ' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the european union ' s 15 member states are to remain in place and which are to be shut down ; to expand their work forces or reduce them ; stay in the same location or else move ; be sold or not be sold ; and , in the case of those which are to be sold , to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside europe .    3.0013672149044854
ultimately , it is a question of different spheres of authority , where the european parliament and its members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands .    3.046311574395595
the swedish christian democrats would emphasise the value of the european union ' s and the european parliament ' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction .    2.8225690915083836
tourism and employment    4.1525098580779645
the next item is the report ( UNK / 2000 ) by mr viceconte , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the communication from the commission : ' enhancing tourism ' s potential for employment - follow - up to the conclusions and recommendations of the high level group on tourism and employment ' [ com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cos ) ] .    2.1571891518625588
, rapporteur .    3.02017711459732
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , despite the european union ' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully - fledged community policy on tourism , increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs .    2.7788712804648004
one of the reasons for the community ' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market , which explains its UNK for women and young people , to whom it often offers their first experience of employment .    2.6600418237035646
the importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data .    2.423257511945842
the fact that , due to the absence of sufficiently reliable and scientific statistical data , the tourist industry is in effect an unknown quantity has greatly limited the prospects of pursuing a consistent policy in this area and creating employment on a wider scale .    2.3501333402189784
it would be appropriate , therefore , to begin by UNK the impact of tourism on the lives of union citizens and the UNK , in both economic and social terms , of promoting the european tourist industry .    3.587351623947038
firstly , i would remind you that the tourist industry is one of the infrastructures which any advanced society must have . without it , institutions , business and the world of work could not function .    2.7458567414314894
tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their UNK place of residence and thus confers mobility , the characteristic feature of contemporary society .    2.203453644390101
the term ' tourism ' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun , sea and holidays , which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level .    2.3507057617551195
secondly , i would like to UNK a UNK , taking as a starting point an apparent paradox , which is clearly highlighted by eurostat figures : the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations , but on the contrary the most advanced nations , whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features .    2.520462221741119
clearly , the importance of tourism for the economy of regions traditionally regarded as tourist destinations , southern regions for example , is very different , and should be studied carefully .    2.7244424847779554
it is an obvious truth , and one that is measurable by other economic and social indicators , that thanks to tourism , many mediterranean regions have undergone a radical change for the better in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitants , and achieved a drastic reduction in the numbers UNK .    2.61944706638696
social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists , thus creating an entire productive system .    2.726812750738774
in such cases , there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers , thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy .    2.75366794685634
this reminds us that tourism cannot be regarded as the poor countries ' petroleum industry , because it requires huge investment in structures , infrastructures , entrepreneurship , professional expertise , social services and training ; that the tourist industry is essential for the equilibrium of many regions as it provides a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activities : agriculture , small firms in the industrial and craft sector , transport , services , retail sector , training , etc ; that the development of the community ' s tourist industry is closely linked to its sustainability with regard to the community objectives ; that the varied geography and historical , cultural and environmental heritage must be protected and exploited .    2.2982942988661623
in my opinion , the european union can , in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity , supplement the action of the member states and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures , such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the treaties ; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the union , with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms : rural , environmental , cultural , conference - based , spa - related and sports - related tourism , and also tourism focusing on senior citizens , research and training ; the amendment of directive 95 / 57 / ec on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism ; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures ; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences .    2.6072630921977
these and other specific measures included in my report can , in my view , lend added value to the actions that the competent national and regional authorities should foster , in order to promote tourism and create new jobs , starting with the adoption of positive fiscal measures to assist small and medium - sized firms , particularly by reducing the burden of charges on labour .    2.6776068302238207
mr president , commissioner , before i explain to you the position of the committee on women ' s rights and equal opportunities , i would like to share with you three basic factors which , in my opinion , determine the present and future of european tourism in an international environment .    2.6383338618777863
in europe today , the tourism market contributes 5 . 5 % of the gross national product and UNK a rather significant proportion of the workforce , approximately 6 % .    2.578440277740925
those figures are UNK higher for some countries .    2.5530411561461768
to grasp the importance of tourism for some parts of europe , it is worth pointing out that in my own country , greece , a country that attracts tourists , over the past four decades , during which the farming population has clearly aged and the population is over - concentrated in the major urban centres , the only areas which have retained populations of low average age or to which young people have returned are ones where tourism has developed .    2.4656705442285523
it is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for europe , tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the european union ' s regions .    3.1644026384055897
another factor is that the world market is growing UNK .    3.4346087955386992
the forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010 , but unfortunately for europe there is a reverse trend .    2.3661475199021935
europe ' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of asia , the far east and america .    2.472754280889734
you see , the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport , its reduced cost , and competition from new centres of tourism outside europe .    2.206057373113502
furthermore , 90 % of businesses active in tourism are small or medium - sized , the very enterprises which form the living UNK of our social and economic tissue , which are called upon to tackle the new obstacles and respond positively to the challenges of this global development .    2.687173703698576
as the rapporteur said , this becomes particularly important when tourism is appreciated as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantities of agricultural and industrial products , services and transport and to create a significant amount of added value .    2.332389022910294
here , then , i want to point out that international competition is tough and , if we are to overcome it positively , we must together UNK and share a long - term strategy .    3.3969181907462818
we must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism , so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age .    3.1025686731394195
today , nobody can ignore the fact that new digital technologies and systems , with internet at the sharp end , mobile telephones and digital television , are bringing about radical changes in tourism as a whole and its respective structures and operational models .    2.2142412267633897
the introduction of these new technologies is not a threat , but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offers the potential to provide new and innovative tourism products and services , which our tourism needs for an ever - UNK tourism season , so that it can attract new customers and offer new and alternative forms of tourism .    2.439959926637262
to this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff , including programmes for training the unemployed and their re - introduction to work .    2.230237300877704
the committee on women ' s rights paid particular attention to the issue of education , because according to official figures women account for 53 % of those engaged in tourism services , and in parallel , they form a majority among the working people most easily affected by social and economic change .    2.5581711116496555
we must not forget that people working in tourism , especially women , encounter particular problems such as seasonal work , the need to renew contracts from one year to the next , social protection , lack of interest in continuing education , and reduced possibilities for development .    2.3945914316923442
we therefore ask the european commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development .    2.9462524806862014
mr president , i would like to begin with some words of optimism , which came to us in the form of the high - level group communication of october 1998 , the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade , it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the union .    2.7020083079518233
in addition , it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created .    2.559560662415327
the commission and parliament are called upon to answer two questions : what are the right conditions and what is the role of the european union on this ?    3.461055919330976
the commission and parliament can help us understand , in the first place , exactly what we are dealing with , because even the term ' tourism ' , as was , moreover , pointed out in the viceconte report , is still an ambiguous term , a kind of UNK that depends on UNK , climate , a range of opportunities , and a series of background factors ; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production , income , wealth and employment .    2.932972817046589
there is a shortage of facts : we have no information on the economic impact , which still remains a complete mystery .    2.802822426057756
we have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other , despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the commission and parliament .    2.5257523656195855
with the aim of working out a strategy , it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible , so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs .    2.8470727576956927
this does not follow automatically : often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry , without this being matched by an increase in employment .    2.816019538415338
there is no legal basis , and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector .    3.4639206250513688
a legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies , to coordinate and to programme , all vital factors for making european union tourism competitive with other markets .    2.101577964644088
a legal basis would mean we would avoid having to draw on the structural funds , as was the case in the past , to obtain some loose change .    2.7704797047016863
moreover , only minimal amounts were made available to us : we should bear in mind that the commission communication indicated amounts totalling eur 4 700 000 000 over the last five years , which corresponds to the cost of building 400 kilometres of motorway .    2.610341934090593
there is no opportunity to send a strong message to the member states : recognising the legal basis of tourism would allow the states to acknowledge one of the european union ' s competences which at the moment , is only exercised in fits and starts .    2.9386352011744004
we fully endorse the community measures which were recommended in the commission communication : UNK taxation , that is , fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95 % of which , i would point out , is made up of small and medium - sized businesses , which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium - sized businesses in the european tourism sector ; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the european union , and therefore to investing in training ; finally , it undertakes to make the job market transparent .    2.8613500693178366
the tourism market is by definition a flexible market ; we do not want this flexibility to be seen in a solely negative light , with seasonal work being misinterpreted as illegal work : remember that 50 % of employment , especially in southern countries of the european union , is done on the black economy .    2.663374122974491
we feel that the european union and the commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism , which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment , after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment .    2.9239563674179228
first and foremost , we need to compete in terms of quality .    3.8604341516698746
finally , we consider that tourism can , in addition to being a growth factor , be a factor for democracy , and in this regard we are asking the commission for a clear , conscious commitment .    3.494190963547258
mr president , there are three points i wish to address .    3.206688639359492
the first is the inclusion of a legal base in the treaty .    3.11803773510245
this is something i favour , but currently as part of a minority in my own group .    2.9350120748148676
we are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism , both to local economies and as a factor of european integration .    3.0153095232620153
the problem for some of us , however , is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity .    3.2413876319378327
second , there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism .    3.339609580740936
the resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism .    2.5690760397862777
at the same time the commission is currently concerned about UNK itself to core tasks .    2.7168166473788706
the question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable .    2.905816766843656
third , there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment .    3.3013211327118728
of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full - time employment .    2.606531408529239
but there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment .    2.808161589698643
students are an obvious example .    2.7015371129120767
we have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection .    2.48872516481596
thus , while complimenting mr viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend , we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed .    2.860171744166611
mr president , i too believe that tourism has a very important role to play , not just in our european regions , but throughout the world , because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development .    3.4938606989557983
but it is also a very vulnerable sector , as we recently saw with the oil slick .    3.138280176141879
a UNK tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick .    2.4274456964222297
when it comes to tourism , we can no longer do what we like where we like .    2.847736710092945
there are huge reserves ; certain zones , rural zones , so - called zones lagging behind but which still have UNK nature and UNK natural habitats , are listed as having good potential for what we call eco - tourism or green tourism .    1.9894901372883353
this could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs .    3.3128463335532636
but these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors .    2.342309948192345
we must not kill the goose that lays the golden UNK of tourism .    2.048625218974703
tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future .    3.61825186399529
i can think of many mountain regions which are continually UNK in order to develop a tourist sector .    2.803583199179131
we have stopped counting the damage and destruction in natural habitats and mountain zones .    2.2479030642710223
i should also like to refer to the darker side of tourism , the tourism exported from the member states of the european union . i am referring to sex tourism .    3.103114431016707
i know that action is being taken against this so - called tourism elsewhere , but we must remember the european union ' s responsibility at this level .    3.236590214938302
under no circumstances can we , as responsible politicians , allow what is currently happening to continue , with young girls practically bought in the countries of the east and coming here to be abused on the cheap .    2.2397237154653986
finally , i should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy .    2.6983300950349673
i am thinking in particular of countries such as cuba which are isolated but i know , because i have travelled there extensively , that the cubans who come into contact with tourists can learn something of the outside world , obtain different information and pass on different information .    2.233356814471749
for all these reasons , i think that reforming the treaties would allow the huge tourist question , which is an important asset for the whole planet , to be properly integrated .    3.29440983712685
mr president , during the most recent meeting of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i was pleasantly surprised .    2.5144687781966164
the opinion of mr sánchez garcía , addressed to the committee on constitutional affairs , contained a remark regarding the igc .    2.6400284874865405
the draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the treaty .    3.118183076102856
this was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .    2.563931110630025
having heard many members who share the view expressed in the opinion , this was a real relief .    3.204187182198492
unfortunately , his text has not UNK the vote .    2.7392771297493357
it does , however , support my view that i am not , apparently , the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion .    3.618838962400536
this brings me to the content of the report .    2.774361465652168
an important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment .    2.941255915121549
especially in the southern member states , the tourist industry is a major source of income .    3.58818974719098
from this vantage point , there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy .    2.6321921873613916
the seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention .    2.2943417227790897
i am surprised , however , at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of community policy .    4.15210182201469
this is not desirable , either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment .    2.4041772938830026
the discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors .    2.248273202831098
within these regions , a huge range of problems have their part to play .    2.5103103264149556
it is obvious that mainly local and regional - and , therefore , to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy .    2.595796830610012
for this reason , i cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to european level .    2.813342889876128
in addition , employment policy in general is also a factor .    3.1248151297414952
here too , the structure of the economy differs for each member state , and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse .    3.6138504001026854
it will not do for one type of policy , probably with many exceptions and UNK , to be applied .    3.0276359028038633
this would mean that the eu would UNK be removing tasks from member states and that the brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily .    2.886071916276229
their expertise , is , of course , UNK to that of the commission .    3.3421118606925284
this is why i am very hesitant when it comes to formulating community measures to promote employment .    2.7711427675396427
even in the tourism industry .    3.7753282777947934
it would really be a nuisance if parliament were to attempt to achieve this UNK by extending its powers .    2.416075247416327
mr president , you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands .    3.195799251403913
first of all i should like to thank mr viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report .    3.2749635405512634
it is a very extensive report .    2.8510512199375495
we greatly welcome it , just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on , the report of the high - level working group which was set up by the european commission .    3.2599387720906803
i hope that the commission will not forget that .    3.47638368140212
having set it up , i hope the commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust .    2.45202992197185
tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation .    2.306614794946335
as has already been said in this debate , three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for .    2.5743758633620577
europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy - making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position .    2.9239200050771084
we need a more dynamic vision based on tourism ' s contribution to job creation .    2.3851079217622466
we must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross - border activity and therefore deserves a european policy with a stimulating , innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development .    2.1274795640018263
i know the commissioner is very keen on information technology .    2.7764535469964122
he has convinced me of that .    2.5769890353168483
but his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together .    2.329335222844232
there are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test - UNK , therefore , for integrating job creation strategies .    2.697774074372722
let us look at some of these reasons .    3.0430017078523197
the importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one .    3.066716263403511
various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry , particularly the more vulnerable groups , such as young people , women and the unskilled .    3.006360162654242
i am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first .    2.8340110008872124
the availability of unskilled , temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the community .    3.4564721593656573
tourism contributes to regional development - in rural areas that are maybe trying to diversify - and tourism contributes to urban areas that aim to raise the profile of their own cultural heritage .    2.510838283748177
if we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across europe .    2.430997703987894
we must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to europe ' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact , about forty years .    3.3463296600217296
we are losing market share .    2.676585666345528
i believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive .    3.022005526710283
i hope you will help us .    2.8519915116638077
and of course , tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment , especially among society ' s more sensitive sections : women and young people .    2.5591200016178206
in view of all this , i think it is a serious contradiction that there is no european policy on tourism .    3.969160880997359
the lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector .    2.8052603850257705
the occasional application of article UNK - formerly article UNK - which requires unanimity , has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only eur 8 million for five years and 15 member states .    2.421925957214564
the measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective , and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection , environmental policy , transport policy , taxation policy , etc . , which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult , since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them .    2.377882475186118
with sorrow , i stress that in the context of restructuring the commission ' s services , tourism is dealt with by a section , not even a directorate , within the directorate - general for ' enterprise ' .    2.884214484783263
but we must support our tourism !    2.9356231240380635
in our view , the UNK which could create a basis for its support are : the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector , the framing of a community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market , coordination of the tourism policy with other , parallel community policies which affect it directly or indirectly , a study of the sector , and the adoption of medium and long - term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product .    2.771933061197612
mr president , commissioner , since the issue of employment has been raised , i want to recall another issue which is also very serious , namely the bankruptcies among tour operators and their consequences mainly for hotels , which are small or medium enterprises lacking the necessary organisation and access to information that would indicate to them whether or not their contractual partners are UNK .    2.467549245049699
clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level .    3.064906857595948
in contrast , at european level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and tour operators , for example a regulation of such relations , the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund , etc . , in collaboration with representatives from the two branches .    2.7980383867187926
since then , however , there has been no progress .    3.7203910625380394
there must therefore be measures to improve the quality and competitiveness of europe ' s tourism and , to the extent of the possible , safeguard the operation of companies .    3.425877698064826
such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure , so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism .    2.657599898272839
i will end by congratulating mr viceconte and , as one who comes from UNK , a tourist area , i ask that we should always view tourism not only in terms of pleasant holidays but as a primary job creator in a europe which needs those jobs .    2.9248583371692014
mr president , commissioner , the new attitude adopted recently by the commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who , in recent years , have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the community framework .    2.9814497496536276
we all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause - effect relationship between tourism and employment . it is also due to the recognition by the european union , since the 1997 conference on these issues , of the enormous potential , represented by tourism , for employment .    3.1709675278819183
in this respect the commission communication before us today is opportune , as is the report by mr viceconte whom i congratulate .    3.203642082667049
this report contains 34 conclusions , including 15 calls to the commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection , particularly in outermost and island regions .    2.6193366483449707
it also contains four calls to the member states which highlight the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities and the establishment of measures favourable to tourist - oriented smes , particularly in the tax sector and in access to financial instruments . these would encourage the growth of employment in sectors which use labour intensively , such as the tourist sector .    2.6390143870415046
finally , once this legal basis to which many of us aspire has been established so that a common tourism policy can be developed , we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment , as proposed by the commission with the support of this house . in this strategy , young people and women , training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention .    2.973745765728872
mr president , commissioner , i should like to start by thanking mr viceconte for his report , which has drawn our attention to a sector which is all too often underestimated .    3.0431799112991276
tourism is a social , economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most european citizens , either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services .    2.392404219361445
every year , nearly 200 million europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel , usually to other countries in europe .    2.5336818742447544
moreover , europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries , even though it faces increasingly UNK competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products .    2.449324066531512
since the treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real community tourism policy , the european union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment .    3.2101211811286277
vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in europe especially , as far as tourist service providers are concerned , in meeting UNK demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers .    2.3727896609047177
employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious , thereby hampering its sustainable development .    2.3679854140414394
it is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible .    2.083639496263167
as the report notes , the adoption by the member states of tax incentives for smes in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour - intensive sectors and , consequently , in the tourism sector .    3.0093361779845997
this sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions , especially the most remote and island regions , which have UNK assets in this area .    3.429943763560255
let us not forget that , in the most remote regions , tourism is the most important industry in terms of income .    3.7705099803472297
the income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the community .    2.0729686106115905
in addition , tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement , insofar as it makes us more aware of other european cultures and thus helps respect for european ways of life to develop .    2.141474053847677
it goes without saying , therefore , that tourism , developed rationally in the long term , should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies , while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural , cultural , historical and environmental heritage .    2.3841180283654118
i should like to close by stressing the essential role which the european union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental europeans to discover the most far - UNK destinations in europe , namely the most remote regions .    2.6550464963039153
mr president , we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance . the basic document is really no more than a commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment .    2.58980152680275
not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 april 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old .    2.339395562835654
this document stems from the previous commission . it is undoubtedly the result of work carried out by commissioner UNK throughout his term of office and which UNK in the luxembourg summit and his failed UNK programme .    2.8996144906198915
i believe this is the first debate in this house with the new commission and a new commissioner , mr liikanen , who is of course listening very closely to what we are discussing .    3.8246078734327384
i would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly .    2.8102336305079536
firstly , the governments made a commitment at the maastricht conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the treaties . this commitment was not fulfilled in the treaty of amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding .    2.7704538398315157
yet there is a council resolution from last june on tourism and employment .    2.9511209789475505
what expectations does the commissioner have that the new intergovernmental conference which is starting will include this aspect ?    2.4581701595748697
my second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward .    2.3922116107101696
bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade , as highlighted by mr koch , does commissioner liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy , given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment ?    2.9793294713096192
will the commission present new initiatives in order to see whether , through the constant efforts of the commission and parliament , we can gradually convince the council to do something on this issue ?    4.007814853616336
mr president , commissioner , first of all i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr viceconte , who spoke at such length on the tangible possibility , for the fifteen member states of the union , of creating jobs by way of a sensible policy , a sensible european union initiative in this field .    2.6286539990397944
this very afternoon we have had a debate on workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed . we now hope to be able to solve these problems .    2.821370815721549
tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the european union .    2.2760542660511947
all the european states are known throughout the world for being tourist UNK UNK by all , including the united states of america , which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native americans .    3.1432088892278034
i would like to stress one point in the viceconte report which i welcome and particularly support , and which i would like the house and the commission to reflect on before giving a favourable response .    3.3959004305272957
it regards tourism for senior citizens .    2.4639334175703542
i usually see commissioner diamantopoulou desperately UNK her hair out , bit by bit , because the elderly live too long , leading to problems with pension payments .    2.0433985938138806
however , in this case , the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens .    3.829428405743564
unfortunately not all , but many of them travel the world to see its UNK and to discover and learn more about it : italians want to see what the english are like , the greeks want to see what the UNK are like and the french want to see their italian UNK .    2.579646335086589
tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen states and of the entire world closer together , and of course , it leads to peace and understanding .    3.228451482144381
this kind of tourism , which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens , is just as important .    3.263498015740103
this type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations , not just during the summer when we go UNK in the sea , for example , but also during winter when we go to take the air .    3.0436369313949214
senior citizens are always on holiday , all year round , from 1 january through to 31 december because they do not work and do not have just one month off during the year .    2.4589416286954298
unfortunately , this is not true of them all , but this is why i am calling on the commission to follow up on the viceconte report .    3.782396054513535
. mr president , i would first like to thank the rapporteur , mr viceconte and congratulate him on the report .    2.955921940630591
i think we all acknowledge the economic , social and environmental importance of tourism in today ' s developed europe and its great potential for growth and employment .    2.572615512027969
i am glad to see that the commission and parliament are converging towards the same goal in this area .    2.7706859330060274
employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism .    2.6310020409793813
an essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect is that the cooperation with member states and the industry and with other partners be as fruitful as possible .    3.7292283126645267
this will determine the success of our work .    3.2363867671943427
certainly the commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies .    2.7849982501002755
this will also be important with a view to the special summit in march , where tourism is bound to be mentioned as a significant contributor to employment .    2.7019248125911446
coordination of community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies , transport , employment , environment , culture and competition must strongly involve member states and the tourism industry itself .    2.558426220098162
as far as specific policies are concerned , i would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy .    3.0150133462674136
the commission guideline document for the new structural fund ' s programming period has already identified tourism as one of the areas with particular potential for employment creation through competitive enterprises .    2.4007437386087433
the commission expects member states to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming .    2.3626118420034947
quality , sustainability , innovation are at the forefront of the commission ' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the council of ministers .    3.197605258019124
quality products in order to improve competitiveness , sustainability in order to protect resources and innovation in particular through the use of information technologies .    3.0943514784037927
regarding sustainability indicators , the european environment agency is already working with the commission on the issue .    3.3983092238000374
i want to mention , as has already been mentioned by many speakers today , that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the eu during the next two decades .    2.9987918262382065
these possibilities should be fully exploited .    2.792329743284343
mr provan said that i often talk a lot about tourism and information technology .    2.4735222362635394
i am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for european tourism .    2.4364921906833117
the travel and tourism sector is the front - UNK in making use of ict tools .    2.5371754666712483
this will dramatically change the way it operates .    2.752783059546887
marketing , reservation and transport are expected to be the areas of UNK change and improvement .    2.771815477127149
use of ict opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism .    2.9710429929304683
direct business to consumer contact will supplement , and sometimes also reduce , the currently , nearly exclusive business to business relationship .    1.9838148215113198
it will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products .    2.060822269014109
for the commission this requires that action in the tourism field must be tightly linked to measures promoting the take - up of information communication technology by the tourism industry , in particular by the innovation and innovative society technological programmes which are both within my competence .    2.3959922592858742
the implementation of the directive on statistics aims at improving the knowledge of market structures and trends in european tourism and its industry .    2.694269908437221
commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach .    2.362922620927293
the report on the experience acquired in the work carried out under this directive is part of our work programme for the current year .    3.6742542011118635
more work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently on - going with the international organisations , such as the world tourism organisation .    3.1912300618485645
the european community ' s prime role is to ensure a framework which enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimise and realise the tourism sector ' s potential for growth and employment .    2.48740065682167
such a european strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by member states and the commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas : exchange and dissemination of information , notably through new technologies ; training in order to upgrade skills , quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism .    2.9406074106675866
in the autumn the commission will report back on the progress made in this respect .    3.4155178634220937
a report on the work to be undertaken , together with the member states and the tourism industry should be available in about two years from now .    3.257114563184301
depending on the results of this work , a wider debate could then take place which might well be the starting - point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives .    2.432617604104766
mr medina ortega asked me some very concrete questions .    2.2385131993613516
as regards the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned , we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the framework on tourism .    3.2015632369288896
it is not only the targeted , specific tourism actions which are important but the other horizontal actions in the field of transport .    2.602740927379487
at the moment , the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem .    2.7196541057619363
in the area of environment , we are looking at ways to cooperate with mrs wallström ; in the area of regional policy mr barnier is giving a lot of attention to this sector .    3.321189151120224
we need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies .    2.503897518377634
i am sure that we will improve on that in the future when we have had a good high - level working group report , your support with your report here and also when the tourism sector is part of enterprise policy .    3.1022724840329308
why is it so important in that sector ?    2.5061850455260326
it is because the key emphasis on the enterprise policy will be how to help to create new enterprises ; how to make it easier for young people and women to create their own enterprises .    2.58969951095384
that is where the potential is .    2.6992315319437252
if we can eliminate the obstacles to make it cheaper to create new enterprises , to facilitate the access to financing and to change the attitude of society to be more positive entrepreneurship , i am sure the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from this .    3.1496093818488196
there is one problem that i hesitate to mention today as i am new in the sector .    2.399449413078417
i have been working now in all industrial and service sectors , but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible .    2.4672137291103517
it is very difficult for a commissioner to try to work in an area where there are dozens of different organisations whose representativeness needs to be ascertained every time .    2.8204253385633327
to strengthen the role of tourism in europe , the organisations should do what has happened in most economic sectors : seek better focus , better coordination and concentrated activities .    2.767357186533896
then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work .    2.6083492925706766
that is the real difficulty which we must overcome .    2.943172603026686
as far as the treaty is concerned , the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet .    3.15360659320587
i want to be very UNK : i have not seen much enthusiasm about that conference or the proposal to enlarge the powers of the eu .    2.9123468859522768
tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the eu .    2.7884638450404364
we will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case .    3.6574245913157846
finally , the commission welcomes the resolution which continues the line of the high - level group , the commission communication on enhancing tourism ' s potential for employment and the corresponding council conclusions .    2.958578229256529
the general agreement between both institutions in this field must not keep the commission from following the most pragmatic approach in achieving our common objectives .    2.2499696435008274
thank you , commissioner .    2.120450226877885
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a . m .    1.9308565305978025
( the sitting was closed at 7 . 40 p . m . )    1.9854601505022489
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.588172984177108
the minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .    2.0123264391846676
are there any comments ?    2.1658741078678636
mr president , yesterday ' s minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so - called ' strasbourg declaration " which intends to UNK the european parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that i am a nazi .    2.909307532252362
i thank the president , mrs fontaine , who just yesterday expressed her opinion by UNK the UNK of this house .    2.9971990513473448
mr president , as well as UNK the UNK , UNK UNK and the democratic government of the basque country - who have the kind of attitude which , in the case of ireland , deserved the nobel prize - by calling them nazis , the declaration insults representatives of the european citizens - as in my case : i represent a section of UNK society - by saying that we are more dangerous than the nazis , and insults groups which are clearly democratic , with decades of history , in an unacceptable and crazy way , which i would like to condemn here and now .    2.9442377821033157
i would like these words to be heard , because the european parliament cannot be UNK in this way in a crazy declaration which i consider to be totally unacceptable .    3.267631721935539
thank you , mr nogueira , for your explanation .    2.705734833954689
i would remind you that questions on the minutes should refer to the minutes .    2.7962771977642347
in any event , for those members who not aware of the president ' s position , i will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today ' s minutes :    3.1098342520314946
" on 17 february , mrs nicole fontaine , president of the european parliament , received as UNK , at their request , the representatives of the forum d ' UNK .    2.8458216318845273
the spanish vice - presidents of the european parliament were represented .    3.4349650871527264
following this interview , the representatives of this forum presented her with a text entitled " strasbourg declaration " . the president wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this " declaration " .    2.073266896493901
strasbourg , 17 february " .    2.719364662106697
i therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up .    2.9511558866119905
mr president , i would like to request a correction to the minutes regarding the vote on amendment no 5 of the swoboda report .    2.5534138992492226
please note that mr michel UNK , mr jean saint - UNK and i voted against this amendment .    2.8062783087501377
we take note and this will appear in the minutes .    2.8918672615252246
mr president , this is not exactly a point of order but concerns a communication we have before us today , namely that the conference of presidents open to members , which was scheduled for 23 february , has now been cancelled .    2.5939843234797197
we should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings .    2.542113712573309
i have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform .    2.909459356361361
we can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers .    2.314411143844071
that would be more productive and i do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already UNK being cut again and again because of this kind of show - piece .    2.7149668974186034
so i think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all .    2.5469751672621066
mr bösch , i take note of your observation but , clearly , we hold this type of conference of presidents , open to all meps at the original request of the meps , so that they may participate in some of them .    2.9370511254161378
surely we should be more selective .    3.7069449553150142
in any event , the bureau will consider your suggestion .    2.1955679365108782
( the minutes were approved )    2.0038305127267746
vote    3.1522193301854244
mr president , we should like to request that the last sentence of amendment no 2 which reads : ' also calls on the member states to promote tourism for the elderly ' be incorporated into paragraph 25 , which deals specifically with social tourism , after : ' tourism for organised social groups . ' .    2.589577394691412
we think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective .    2.411546301554978
mr president , the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the european union .    2.8838561088044545
it is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the eu ' s areas of competence .    2.362569557314588
a criticism which is often levelled at the eu and which , to some extent , is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas .    3.404927168394875
in so far as tourism falls within the political domain , it should be at national , regional and local level .    2.7021091924507443
tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the eu ' s financial support for less well - off regions .    3.614838491045094
even in that respect , any cooperation should , however , be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle .    3.4614229655825133
because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment , there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation .    3.3884847782856204
however , such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy .    2.802140574191324
the report UNK the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism .    3.7489264560562487
however , the swedish christian democrats would oppose any such development as we believe that tourism is a matter with which the european union should only be marginally concerned .    3.134814767972596
. ( da ) tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market , which ought to be promoted and encouraged .    3.0499002134015463
it is of inestimable importance that people in europe , as well as in the rest of the world , should have the opportunity to experience each other ' s ways of UNK their lives and their societies .    3.1165448992832867
policy on tourism is not , however , something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the european parliament or by the eu as a whole .    3.8629182027943516
i am therefore voting against the proposal .    2.879079685619691
mr president , before we begin our discussion , as an italian mep - and i believe i also speak on behalf of all italian meps - i should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the german chancellor , who UNK in italian internal affairs , when he threatened that europe would intervene if any neo - fascists became members of the government .    2.73944450806642
fortunately , the italian government and the president of the republic intervened , and today the italian ambassador to germany will also speak on the subject , to call on the german chancellor not to interfere in italian internal affairs , in so far as there are no neo - fascist candidates for government office .    2.595933491605264
we would like to thank the president of the republic , as well as the government and all the politicians who spoke and we too , in this house , would also call on the german chancellor not to intervene in italian internal affairs .    3.158252376623245
mr UNK will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order , but i understand his political meaning .    3.392051246630508
we will proceed to the debate itself and mr monti will take the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.86631687978553
european postal services    3.991854615354384
the next item is the debate on the oral question ( b5 - 0010 / 2000 ) tabled by mr hatzidakis , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , to the commission , on european postal services .    2.6280956298028406
mr president , the commission ' s proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the commission and the fact that the new commission needs to re - examine the issues involved .    2.9112086431153235
with regard to parliament ' s various resolutions on the postal sector , my colleague , commissioner bolkestein , has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which parliament held last year .    2.9886822834237496
furthermore , as regards consultations with parliament , commissioner bolkestein will meet the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism next monday .    2.6954820248240687
the studies were sent to the committee and to the meps who requested them , in september 1999 and are , in any case , still available .    3.1601433820272034
they can also be consulted on the commission ' s internet website .    3.208962802247193
i am sure commissioner bolkestein will listen carefully to all parliament ' s comments .    2.963858678762779
the commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector .    2.9226211148163213
furthermore , the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation .    2.7539497644075617
i can confirm that it is commissioner bolkestein ' s firm intention to present a proposal to the commission by the middle of the year , to be forwarded to parliament and the council .    3.6910020765155647
the date set for completing the next phase , which the commission intends to keep to , is 1 january 2003 .    2.8779591118946546
the proposal will take account of the studies and , in particular , the need to maintain a universal service , to develop efficient safeguards for consumers , to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition .    2.8929428375690787
the proposal , when it is put forward , will take account of the points of view of member states , parliament , users , universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties , all of whom have been involved in an in - depth consultation process .    3.0403265342319403
the aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the european union .    3.008935357611765
mr president , the postal sector continues to be an area in which old , outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition .    2.787390780117396
and , in the absence of any energetic action by the commission , the situation has gone on for far too long .    3.500522501156694
the eu ' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas , but not in the postal sector .    3.126403410905052
we have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the commission to put forward proposals , so i should be grateful if the commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new , modern europe - wide postal system .    2.7597285822334756
one of the eu ' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market .    3.6428642888677105
we are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more member states .    2.2643721399126706
that requires greater efficiency which , in turn , is dependent on competition .    2.6385188345447506
it is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and , moreover , because it will lead to lower prices . all that , we are assured , will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market .    3.0431494971563593
it has been done in a number of different areas but , unfortunately , the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now .    3.058311923462095
it can hardly be because customers are satisfied .    2.3223264116397435
we are all familiar with the much - criticised price UNK , and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion .    2.4099501919645916
if we really want a functioning internal market , we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services .    2.808347160571593
a number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services .    2.883049845637242
the netherlands , finland and sweden have travelled UNK along this road .    2.4844310245288295
during the 1990s , they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved .    3.2485253393170406
moreover , sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus .    2.2504240982486228
the process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement .    2.9168292521137333
experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which , as customers , we are all entitled to expect .    3.1680242874921056
prior to this discussion , a letter was sent out by UNK of the old monopolies .    3.4818673164851344
they hold up sweden as a warning , which might be appropriate in certain instances , but not as regards postal services .    2.4151529567913985
it is alleged in a UNK that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993 .    2.3897255645049573
that is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where , in practice , there is still a monopoly , that is where the state is the only player .    3.1750018166687606
however , for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market , prices have fallen .    3.083502942733963
that shows that competition really is working .    2.496845687436153
my conclusion is therefore : make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market , too .    3.186148590176979
it is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for .    2.6698620886702003
( the speaker is interrupted by mr markov ) i thought i had the floor .    2.3010430427905915
perhaps we can discuss this later on .    2.4329158621811047
however , i should like to affirm that it is exactly as i said , namely , that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition , whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly .    3.0611009097467345
that is usually the case .    2.613075649963449
that is why i should now like to see a commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector .    2.926325829659025
mr markov , in five or six minutes time , you will be allowed a few minutes to speak .    2.5662228671406018
i would be grateful if you would not interrupt other members .    2.494603414170582
mr president , there is a mystery .    2.9484735427443205
what happened to the postal services directive that was passed on 15 december 1997 ?    2.475602845817482
there has been a deafening silence from the commission during the period between then and now .    2.8539415815046207
i am sorry it is commissioner monti who is here today .    2.5549036921129002
i am very fond of him .    2.4791824479993103
he is one of the more UNK and hard working commissioners .    3.410537052867302
it is a pity i cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues .    2.836225148482069
commissioner monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties .    3.0690724452407494
that has only happened recently .    2.669276257380062
for over a year the old commission could have done some work on this .    2.768573559525986
however , since commissioner monti is here , i would like him to take a message back to commissioner bolkestein telling him what the postal services directive was about .    2.8544402340644157
it was about gradual liberalisation ; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price ; it was about direct mail and cross - border mail remaining in the reserved sector .    2.221653302809491
these issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive .    2.4400646923682765
the postal service is not just for christmas .    3.458680786019936
it is for life .    2.8434093396709423
in the area in scotland i come from it is much more than just a postal service .    3.060752161752191
it is about keeping communities together .    2.5062097421092115
the postal service is also the bus service .    2.793540102225272
the postal service is also the social service .    2.822847119554607
the postal service is also the doctor .    2.918918903681869
if we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade .    2.3543007601788397
we will cut them off .    2.5447383488553315
the postal services are important .    3.183029782564902
that message must be taken back from here today .    2.821054619356096
the commission must listen to it .    2.6972166598021823
mr president , we are in favour of liberalising the union ' s postal services .    3.2594438413896003
this should first of all stand for better service .    2.956867503072095
this is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal .    3.11377551997547
liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly .    2.960714548656194
is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer ' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly , because , for example , the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically ?    2.5282249542845747
the question is , therefore : what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet ?    2.560962728073669
most member states have been putting the UNK on , and i am pleased to note that , in my country , the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago , and that the belgian postal services and the belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition .    3.837688585433435
as you can see , as a new mep , i am trying to get to grips with the dossier and i must admit that i have great difficulty doing so .    3.0615228648977175
i have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the european commission at the time , and i am also coming across documents from post - europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect .    2.991257079392653
i think that the commission could have been more pro - active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested .    2.754018567170213
as far as i know , that has still not happened .    2.5927563110946257
i would therefore ask you , commissioner , to help me in my task as a new member .    2.951364053520667
like mr miller , i would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or , if at all possible , within the next couple of days .    2.9213849165094055
my second point concerns the universal provision of services . what is happening on this score , how much does it cost , how does it work , how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have ?    2.29862652303612
i would welcome more concrete information on this .    2.6218516639199163
apparently , the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so .    3.1414334384406097
there are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the post office .    2.7162020419899564
moreover - and mr miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round , even in my country , however densely populated it may be .    2.8089194723856856
but in belgium too , there are a great number of people , older people for example , who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman .    3.5074574385948956
the postal service is also extremely important to companies .    2.7690342379181843
a study has shown that 90 % of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10 % between individuals .    2.829170789913789
what exactly do you intend to liberalise ?    2.9295625292274465
i would like more information on this , because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services .    2.76471829202687
there are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job .    2.544529051774314
we need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things .    2.6592420772049232
mr president , commissioner , this morning on french national radio , i heard that liberalisation of the french postal service was now only a matter of days or hours away and that it was irreparable , like the developments with our neighbours in sweden , the netherlands and germany .    2.523843976064926
this concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today .    3.0048376913068435
the commission is committed to a universal postal service , as the european parliament has shown on several occasions , the postal service is actually , as some speakers have already mentioned , a key factor in social and territorial cohesion .    3.210646349064155
in this connection i should like to ask one of our swedish meps for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution .    3.031322771249598
that is not the sort of postal service that we want .    3.255606273392621
the economic value of the postal service was recognised by the treaty of amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail .    3.2582772079630473
it is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a ' public service ' , which makes it possible for everyone resident within european territory to receive the service , and this entitlement must remain an acquired right , an acquis communautaire .    2.5068660302280845
the matter of the european union ' s recognition of a high - quality postal service , available to all , remains valid today , and we are increasingly concerned .    3.6076817434840245
that is why today we are asking not to have any nasty UNK in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism come monday .    2.821978920839362
let us point out that parliament ' s positions were clearly defined and that the group of the greens / european free alliance supported them .    2.8237533064652682
this resolution of 14 january 1999 required that , prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector , involving 1 . 7 million employees after all , the commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation .    2.3493047340628
well , we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses , something we certainly do not want .    3.0332699608075964
we value our public service , our universal postal service , because we know , and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens , that the citizens value this service and the commission undertook , during mr bolkestein ' s hearing , to maintain this universal service throughout the european union .    3.022723911755855
we further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision , as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive .    2.8755600768997556
we shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the states which consider this service essential to the citizen .    2.996308141680573
mr president , i share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost - effectiveness of the services offered .    3.1058948101064456
but as an entrepreneur myself , i really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of " privatisation " and " liberalisation " !    2.589058416219635
or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all , but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large UNK .    2.7676328223425566
members should however represent all the citizens , which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy .    3.2169055957577672
in practice that means the following for the postal services : firstly , priority must be given to employment .    2.942358765744489
i have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation , but the premises must be right .    2.5069816918387002
secondly , we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services .    2.8270973196640727
examples in germany and sweden show that this certainly is a risk .    2.621516404586845
mr stenmarck , sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other member states of the european union .    2.7219154696861967
so that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent .    3.104690751435862
thirdly , it is vital to have , first of all , a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens , wherever they may be ; secondly , to have a uniform price for all member states ; and thirdly , to have daily mail deliveries and UNK on working days .    3.0506709816674507
on the question of the cost - effectiveness of the various postage UNK , it is worth considering further price cuts ; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying .    3.2512804930906185
we do not have to adhere to a weight of over UNK when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of UNK to make it at all worthwhile .    3.0374847600589985
in that respect i believe it was right and important to hold this debate today , to make mr bolkestein aware of parliament ' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset .    2.8735172638933015
mr president , the 1997 directive , issued on 21 january 1998 , which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in europe , envisaged a revision at a later date , in a rather convoluted manner , indeed , since it was to be dealt with in a commission proposal by the end of 1998 , then decided by 1 january 2000 , to come into force finally by 1 january 2003 .    2.71118543839642
well , for the time being , the revision has not got off the starting block .    2.83865148223961
the two initial phases were not observed which , logically , ought to compromise the third .    2.088840422980661
my first question is this : surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case ?    2.4504620481563384
apparently , they were .    3.3277740307743278
it is really not possible to see how the commission could by the end of 1998 , as stipulated by article 7 of the directive , have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in february of the same year .    3.2654427760228497
moreover , the commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which , according to article 23 , it was to submit by 31 december 2000 .    3.432255997970297
should we complain about this delay ?    2.561432544211203
we do not think so .    2.8597490112666035
if the commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards , no one doubts that it would present it without delay .    2.3923811462923874
for its part , the european parliament , which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service , is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be UNK .    2.7932466470460597
in these circumstances , it is quite reasonable for this house to express concern today , asking an oral question which urges the commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen .    2.699021026261354
what are the scenarios for development and the potential risks ?    2.919899179832187
the main risk is that the commission , without adequate justification , might upset the balance which exists now by proposing to go swiftly on to a second phase of liberalisation which would , in some countries , throw off balance the funding of the universal postal service , making it UNK .    2.6625767644578744
today , following the 1997 compromise , member states can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff , with a weight of less than 350 grammes .    2.5158568133388104
it may be supposed , for example , as commissioner bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 september last year , that the commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 UNK and two and a half times the basic tariff .    2.531408196191917
this solution would not , in our opinion , be a fair one and indeed the commission would have no UNK figures to support it .    3.2055853331986746
but , unfortunately , we are aware since seattle that the commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage .    3.3615625619036336
the second scenario , which we prefer : to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper , detailed objective study of the effects of the 1997 directive .    2.6289180140534896
in saying that , we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with , but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service .    3.089807316508018
in france , for example , the unequal distribution of the population over a vast territorial area makes the obligation to provide a public service absolutely indispensable in mail distribution if one wishes to maintain the equality of citizens and social cohesion .    2.5776480623470115
but other countries , in other situations , may have alternative analyses .    3.1518278734541787
in our opinion , each one must be free to make its own organisational choices .    2.5391108515613774
in fact , article 86 of the ec treaty , formerly article 90 , stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them .    2.287198316692349
but who defines these tasks ?    2.6102288909550317
who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised ?    2.1894237434873807
our answer is clear : it is not the commission nor even the council or the european parliament , but the people of each member state by democratic procedures .    4.015485763297586
to wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions .    3.0575233629112155
mr president , we are currently in the first phase of transposition of directive 97 / 67 / UNK on postal services and i am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered .    2.8763943285328764
during mr bolkestein ' s hearing , my colleague UNK UNK asked for an undertaking " that any new proposals , once these are known , should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted . "    2.4483463775375767
what has become of it ?    2.7363635783962486
do we have the results of this impact study ?    3.5702177101502013
as you know , we members of the edd group , are in favour , along with others , of rural life , maintaining employment , and social cohesion in rural areas , a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service .    2.87696546146529
unfortunately , this is not the case and currently , by merging the start of the application of the european directive and the application of the 35 - hour law , which is purely french , but also by changing the working time criteria , such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per UNK as opposed to 1 400 , as previously , in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed .    2.6844389934274453
this is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service .    2.855478533102303
i have here the local paper for my municipality , which reads , " the manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 january 2000 " - you can see how topical this is - " the last collection will take place at 3 . 45 p . m . instead of at 4 . 30 p . m . as at present . "    2.3423988458531384
so you can appreciate why i am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation , and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation .    2.6932143366987433
as you know , in our country , each village has its own local post office or at least a post box , with a collection every day .    2.7424703221768563
the postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents .    2.79842541314915
so he delivers money too , and sometimes even medicines , thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home .    2.267755586389097
if postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way , more post offices will be closed , in the name of this UNK profitability , which is often the cause of rural regression .    2.8659671275718495
once again , europe is UNK itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .    2.606798365119059
they will be told that they are too expensive , without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services , where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas .    2.0870099346574986
everyone is free to choose their UNK .    2.7066633725809317
they should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment .    3.2433463378806615
in sport the saying goes , " do not change a winning team . "    2.229617497123721
why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory ?    3.1787377610542964
the universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget .    2.701226808356616
we cannot afford to make a mistake , for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance , the firm will know how to tackle it : jobs will be lost , services will be reduced , the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood .    2.6560616730448428
we are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes , or even 50 grammes .    2.140841057549879
so be it . but the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies .    2.053787760012985
so , once again , why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest , UNK in france , by UNK UNK , as it happens , at ff 8 billion ?    3.2072562661282835
if revenue is lost , then public interest operations will be revised and cut , and again it is in rural areas that the most UNK cuts will be made .    2.6426076974944293
what we should do now , i feel , is wait , particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service , which many of our fellow citizens still value highly .    2.7868163376029567
mr president , i am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at european level .    2.863814161638601
in ireland some services are provided by companies from outside ireland , for example , english companies certainly operate there .    2.3837575763285725
but this directive has never been transposed into national law .    2.670733515950114
it is the job of the commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under european law and transpose european directives .    3.3791712822791284
that has not been done in ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been UNK by the national government .    3.4545264723366644
a small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators .    2.583112406520189
but the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the netherlands they have liberalised , in germany they have not , yet german companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the netherlands .    2.6865544243892296
this is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the union .    3.2176086261651204
i come from a rural area .    2.58697928358798
i support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and i recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years .    2.6049911702743085
for example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the european union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago .    2.8664120470158085
i remember when people came into this house lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation .    2.477258227764049
we allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education .    2.37391688268144
so liberalisation has taken a lot of UNK off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living .    2.4580333847930977
on the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided .    2.794544367667341
so , the commission , in bringing forward their new proposals , must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services .    2.5287560770251467
in rural areas , for many years , even before the irish free state came into existence , we sometimes had this service of a post office .    2.5328359428450047
today , it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that european legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it .    2.634527420716083
i want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service .    2.7317526166929076
but complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in ireland .    2.307809313266249
it should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas .    2.6234126656942123
we must implement what the directive insists on , that the postal service is available to everybody .    3.241354093080205
mr president , commissioner , besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment , they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the european union ' s existence .    3.3065798550386876
as is known , the commission should already , before the end of 1998 , have tabled new proposals for a revision of the postal services directive 97 / 67 , guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service , securing its economic viability , and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved , including postal workers and customers .    2.7128165515876312
to that end , the commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services , the consequences of liberalising cross - border mail and direct mail , the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector , the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process , excluding distribution , and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies .    2.688495595683698
mr president , we are therefore wondering , and we ask the commission - although , of course , mr bolkestein is not here , but mr monti is a man of many parts and i think he may have a view on this : should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each , and i repeat , on each one of the european union ' s member states ?    3.1779833174143697
the postal services in greece , great britain , the netherlands or belgium are , of course , all different .    2.9289915970314784
with liberalisation , how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own , greece , with its particular geographical features and its numerous , small but inhabited islands ?    2.4613493721830024
how can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross - border mail which amounts to approximately 25 % , as opposed to less than 5 % in other countries ?    2.5833254302267834
how are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office ' s business abroad ?    2.999059670207048
we have just heard mr UNK on the subject .    3.301160495947086
it will most certainly be necessary , we say , because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable , to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits .    2.345922981913646
but what will those limits be ?    2.5876532438781914
in any event , we ask the commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals , having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the member states .    2.565268521684582
it is self - evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself , but only a means towards improving services .    2.516045387699646
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future . in other words , what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves , what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide ?    2.838177366528237
this question should be answered in light of the fact that the age - old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of UNK companies and by technological developments , such as fax and e - mail .    2.4165394409512
but then again , the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment .    2.8633716127401265
past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an UNK effect .    2.0485421010796125
i would remind you of the fact that the belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know - how and expertise from disappearing from the company .    2.3740225789710943
once again , the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce .    3.2164163603826617
one should , however , be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy , the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere , in other words , they are often the people which the company in question needs .    2.5517866831827325
in my opinion , it would be a sign of well - thought - out human resource management if the commission were to share a number of these concerns , so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions .    2.884016578197044
mr president , postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in parliament at the moment and rightly so , given their importance .    2.909029015598412
only last week , in the uk parliament at westminster the newly - elected mp from our european free alliance partners , UNK UNK , the party of wales , made his maiden speech on that subject .    2.8836890103817314
the scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices , especially in rural areas , play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities .    2.65640471036421
liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services .    2.989669807145981
post office outlets in scotland , as we have heard , handle much more than just mail delivery .    2.905066086578825
traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house UNK , local taxes and so on . but as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts , so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened .    2.2426012784383493
if a rural post office UNK , usually with the only local shop attached , then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result .    1.95924680261126
instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems , governments , and the commission too , should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon , providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents .    2.454439403824188
mr president , the task of the post office is to ensure that , every day , the post is delivered everywhere , be it in the city or in remote , rural areas , at the same tariff .    3.0064839552053493
they are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs .    2.4017675767023614
i once heard a christian democratic politician make the following comment in a dutch village : " the postal service belongs to us all ; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft " .    2.1838137621846196
the existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors .    2.621023961927807
the UNK are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices .    2.4392124855999513
they can be the UNK for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees .    3.0278495567964283
the end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices .    2.6443478634932034
they will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages .    2.3189756231928467
it is time we stopped this trend .    2.49896162449782
a fault UNK is half UNK .    2.5197575973123354
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , people used to be UNK to demonstrations by letter or telegram ; nowadays this is done by e - mail and via websites !    2.1954698565840207
incidentally , many thanks to mr scharping , the chairman of the european social democrats , for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in austria from his UNK and therefore not advising UNK in favour of violent action to go to vienna tomorrow .    2.7403661578053153
it is clear that electronic mail , electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future .    2.611263575862461
i also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service .    2.3591602388129784
we know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1 . 2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market .    2.9083465263459893
i believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular , which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures .    2.56783500165203
of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage , because they are so densely distributed throughout europe .    2.449043057089201
even the UNK village has a post office and in future e - commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e - mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means . that is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important .    2.1833318787072775
the collection , sorting , transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension .    2.2631383679386894
i believe that in future we must seize this opportunity .    2.575361313223512
as politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests .    2.406872953380116
we want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid .    2.533092806148707
that faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services .    2.398728877147629
we should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector .    2.164131188263602
this transparency is also very important for the unions , for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service ?    2.3326902811442407
i think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice , fairness and solidarity .    2.5983874227432633
but i also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive .    3.736142185659613
we should define the universal service precisely , establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender .    2.2236330261864268
in rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost - effective , i believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent UNK conditions , so that all the market forces , and of course the existing postal services too , can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies .    2.811416952186603
i believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system .    2.7359974560412827
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , postal services , just like any european public service , contribute to the social cohesion of community territory under the terms of article 16 of the treaty of amsterdam .    2.608849429850971
by UNK tariffs , i . e . treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service , by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service , while complying with the requirement for quality of service , postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them .    2.7215306673131487
they also play a major role in maintaining links between people .    2.579082685478268
as has been pointed out here on many occasions , is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in UNK districts or divided communities , whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities ?    2.4599798835370574
let me cite the example of the initiative of the french postal service , which decided , for instance , to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas .    2.8156810260046456
without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors , european public postal services today employ one and a half million UNK whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical , untrammelled liberalisation .    2.0006886797119026
the european parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs .    2.3896674449753372
we may congratulate ourselves on this , but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the european parliament is today being excluded from the main decision - making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in europe .    3.457545189996588
indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 january 1999 .    3.5253733841956367
that resolution called for the european parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved .    2.6254809493805347
these impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation , not just on the economic organisation of the market , but also in terms of its human and social aspects .    3.4730259941246606
the delays in the commission ' s work will inevitably have a knock - on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question .    2.572231026833296
by defining a sector reserved for public postal services , on the basis of weight and price limits , the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases .    2.64953388916911
the sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services .    2.6137932765228244
against a background of globalisation , where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion , we must here , as a matter of urgency , reiterate our commitment to european public service , whether it be , today , the postal service or , tomorrow , the rail service or , the day after that , the health service .    3.056502907649579
mr president , i rise as other scottish members of this house , representatives of scotland , to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts .    2.50367048281354
the postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout europe and not least in scotland .    2.665615800055481
it would be a disaster if action were deliberately , or even UNK , taken which had the effect of damaging that .    2.40297369891189
i do not believe that the commission has set out to make war upon the islands of scotland or greece .    2.8599114226961175
but they might UNK do great damage .    2.4139557605453765
the point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place .    2.3766016857336694
if too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service , it would become UNK to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate .    2.397667258421176
the critical thing is to balance universality and affordability .    2.48058865342335
the message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the house to the commission today is that the commission should tread UNK .    3.541153712879151
the commission should not , for example , take a UNK jump from 350 grammes to , as some have suggested , as low as 50 grammes .    2.5648386475032168
on the contrary , it should proceed cautiously .    2.748235311643286
i imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances .    2.2355946441291956
stand by universality and affordability !    2.7122763263014797
mr president , the only way to guarantee a high - quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service .    3.0404199334958024
a universal service offering high - quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform UNK tariff .    2.6636761251215564
this service must therefore be kept public .    3.062154911995043
this is the only way to guarantee that the network , from collection to distribution , will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators .    2.5822837077711944
any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications , with the objective always being to guarantee a high - quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs .    2.5242897773257686
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker ' s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service , is not a contradiction in terms .    2.8858118081433592
european policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy , telecommunications and air transport - and the target , the focus , was always the consumer .    2.162808517174665
the aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services .    2.7256093795235397
i think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs .    2.1308653673756135
he does not need a government to do so , or a parliament , nor does he need a commission to do so !    3.1766473867805267
the postal market is UNK along behind and , sadly , we have wasted valuable time here .    2.5386621188835647
i believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends .    2.9738894250154564
i am thinking here of the very sound words of mr rübig , who also talked about e - commerce .    2.2847833977984466
that will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges ; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges .    2.3648651494746167
i believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market .    2.29388907519743
it also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of european policy .    2.207469846087517
we should seize that opportunity , for the citizen keeps asking , why do we have europe ?    2.8586985086746353
these are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of europe .    2.6468898978350475
i am glad mr monti , the commissioner for competition , is here today in person , for he is pursuing an excellent policy .    2.587164988270473
and here i want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - parliament and the commission must consider where to draw limits to competition .    3.6769133651219317
we are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy , and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible .    3.3274703631378837
yet i believe that , as this debate has shown , we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas .    4.048619919841492
so i would ask you to give an impetus in that direction , together with parliament .    3.1940292962649526
i have mentioned the example of social services before : nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer , including the pensioner in an old people ' s home , and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition , whether that is the right course .    2.9446960629147636
i believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits , the positive aspects of competition .    2.6085503089892565
for competition is not an end in itself ; it is there to serve of the citizen , the consumer , which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it .    3.5306469855362392
mr president , liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public ; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology .    2.123557785270006
i emphasise the word ' could ' , and that is if it is done well and with care .    2.981253653229796
wrongly done , the threatening UNK that have been described here will certainly become a reality .    2.70797092391335
social problems will increase , interregional disparities will grow , and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest , areas where there are more people and , especially , more businesses .    2.5167133571514224
on the other hand , the UNK will be the remote areas and their inhabitants , and the people that will not benefit from the new services .    3.382218186130621
before we decide whether to liberalise postal services , there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer - friendly , and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology .    2.4837539000564344
i think this policy has been reasonably successful in finland , as UNK by the present public system .    2.807698900977854
i think , however , that common rules have to be applied to this sector , so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the wild west , or even the wild east . we need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service .    3.074973487368547
mr president , a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service .    3.0922936106785306
it would be UNK to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers , millions of service users , in a great rush .    2.7123370713282755
but , despite the unfavourable opinion of ten european postal services , a form of UNK privatisation is UNK in the corridors of the commission .    3.0297669581412277
by lowering the price / weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising UNK or cross - border post , the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector .    2.2132454073015055
postal services may then keep whatever does not UNK the appetite of the private operators .    2.40422180772607
whether total or partial , privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse .    2.0823307369195017
just the example of the privatisation of british rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which UNK for maximum profit is UNK to maintaining a socially useful service .    2.3272986767005928
mr president , today ' s debate comes under the sign of the snail , not because i UNK such excellent UNK here in strasbourg yesterday but because the snail is a symbol of slow progress .    2.2099598253420947
one example of this slow progress is the way the commission is proceeding .    3.5170218722745985
this study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last .    2.860883472390022
i am most grateful to the commissioner for his plain talking today and i would ask the commission to force the pace now .    3.2867507031477845
today ' s debate makes it quite clear that parliament wants more emphasis on speed , not speed at the expense of quality , but then UNK alone does not mean quality either .    2.5115940287551393
this brings me to my second point , namely the snail as symbol of our postal services .    2.482549192361764
what has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from munich to brussels has increased fivefold .    2.645414924454397
letters to strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner , but it still takes far too long .    2.4456656094323153
that means that since the days of mail - coaches and UNK , we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services .    3.009747185566936
it may be true , as was said here , that today we have new possibilities , e . g . electronic possibilities such as e - mail , but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very , very important role and that , in particular , young families , the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail .    2.5505794360472605
so i believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what mr radwan described in such excellent terms , namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other , define the limits .    2.8632458972863466
but what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite !    3.1929851927994166
by embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial UNK we have also witnessed in germany , we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation , which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise !    3.0362845569680044
some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman . let me add to that , the importance of the post offices .    3.630883767613587
they have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas .    2.5302289680689865
i come from munich , a very densely populated urban UNK , but we have the same problem there .    3.349272585140603
one urban district post office after another is being closed down .    2.2192834379227673
we have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities , who are becoming increasingly UNK with the decline in the number of retail UNK .    2.9098469100081576
that is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people .    2.98313871132009
for if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of munich where the mail is collected again in the evening , that reflects a rapid decline in quality , while at the same time prices are sometimes rising , which is something else we must note .    2.304684183622677
so , yes to liberalisation , but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation , rapidly create reasonable conditions in europe and submit the appropriate study to the commission .    2.383649758567557
i would hope that in future the symbol of european postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be UNK post - haste .    2.3617654513568103
that is a term that UNK back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed .    2.730838230632823
like mr radwan , i am glad that commissioner monti is here rather than commissioner bolkestein because i believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition .    2.7265580625581465
i do not know if mr monti is aware of the judgement of the court of justice of the european communities of last week , 10 february , which recognised the possibility of the german postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly .    2.824393937258698
competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 january 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates .    2.5634431715636894
this has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations .    2.694841077223209
for the moment , it appears that , in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - sweden - there has been a 59 % increase in the price of postal services .    3.2245109745030915
we do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place .    3.228110598878786
it is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries , which will no doubt have implications for competition , which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations .    3.5244199674062933
for example , there are currently companies which set up in holland because the postal charges are lower than in germany and the same may happen in the future .    2.5363462263368657
i therefore wonder whether the commission ' s package on postal liberalisation will include the preservation of free competition , because it is very possible that - as has happened in most sectors in the community today - it will lead to concentrations of large companies which will cancel out the benefits of this theoretical liberalisation .    2.8902676134143648
at the moment , in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation , which is agreed within the framework of the universal postal union , allowing for lower tariffs .    2.9391381708621296
in a service which is theoretically liberalised , free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies UNK their dominant position , agreements between companies and other similar circumstances .    2.2657303939052458
i would therefore advise commissioner monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation , taking strict account of free competition , because i believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future .    2.7207347808957776
my prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services .    2.640592743844011
mr president , the postal service is not a normal service provider like a UNK ' s or a UNK centre .    3.0024878632563063
in the world of networking , the mail service is the most democratic of all networks .    2.7257425644440976
it creates and maintains interpersonal relationships .    2.4270055434723794
the common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the UNK .    3.4351051717626575
for us in the north it will mean that the eu will be destroying the social infrastructure .    3.202002569860518
commissioner monti , the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships : postal services must be improved , not run down .    2.776752144316537
only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone ' s reach in society .    2.079595364648098
the post office is democracy .    2.881280394349051
it is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies .    2.113329626230677
telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50 % of companies ' turnover .    2.2281058083937593
democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office .    3.336331052008618
it is particularly appropriate that mr monti is responding to this debate because the great UNK with postal services is how to UNK an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all , even in the UNK and least inhabited region of the european union .    2.5093109873923782
in the UNK and UNK of scotland and the rural borders and central belt , on the beautiful but fragile islands of the UNK , UNK and shetland , there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service .    3.0810643985927175
yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services , like all service industries , are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open , even international , competition .    2.4321340439696284
i would suggest that there is a solution .    3.4875790222334424
it is already employed widely in the transport sector .    2.4884575858196425
air routes , UNK routes , train routes , bus routes , within and to these UNK areas are put out to tender . the bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract .    2.1005619426852817
let us call this a negative tender franchise .    2.3293422744585266
this permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly - supported but fully transparent franchise system .    1.8825067560181015
why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner ?    2.2570622728960212
the lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time .    2.426994419468528
why could not the sub - post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender ?    2.3167168044166337
it would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body , local , regional or national - probably under overall eu supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose .    2.346699182850626
otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace .    3.013619233881876
mr president , commissioner , it is no coincidence that i am the fifth member of this house from scotland to rise to speak in this debate .    2.9228867220467105
that is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services .    2.897630875450081
scotland as a country is larger than some member states .    2.4119440967181816
it has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road , sometimes served poorly by public transport , sometimes not at all .    2.152677248069095
it is on the last two that the elderly , in particular , depend .    3.521159163510444
often they are located together , each service being made more viable by the existence of the other .    2.4472894394123004
scotland also has many island communities , some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea UNK .    2.788170324280121
it has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from edinburgh to the central highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across london .    1.966065794439732
and it is about four times the postage cost actually charged .    2.8311337276621584
the more remote the community , the greater the difference becomes .    2.7313255018788003
that is the measure of the problem .    2.936601546593258
it is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service .    2.575142540146883
it is for all our remote and island communities , no matter where in the european union they are situated , and not just for the people of scotland , that i ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide .    3.0202774010822484
. mr president , i consider it a privilege that i am replacing my colleague , commissioner bolkestein , on the occasion of such a high - quality debate on postal services .    3.3483321811664624
i will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by commissioner bolkestein .    3.3866988623244483
may i repeat that on monday he will be available to the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism of parliament .    2.690471520916567
some members , like mr stenmarck , complain that there have been delays with the new proposal .    3.0052051126863666
others believe that it is not so bad after all , if there is a slight UNK after the first step of liberalisation .    3.6116264517810133
this is , for example , the position expressed by mr berthu .    3.2667612666222667
the commission ' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the commission , of which i am sure parliament is not totally unaware .    3.9301910011094576
but we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made .    3.821972949946087
it is commissioner bolkestein ' s intention to present such a proposal to the commission for adoption in the first half of this year .    3.2405714520384232
the scheduled date of 1 january 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible .    2.9111869324426674
the proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service , to which i will come back in a second .    3.1558723677375355
as regards the existing directive and its implementation , most member states have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive .    2.7097958648498057
a number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence .    3.0322298268753287
the implementation deadline for the member states is january 2003 .    3.2700027578418767
further liberalisation will occur afterwards .    2.714124269683051
in some areas competition is already taking place , as in the parcels sector and in the express services .    2.983552427556007
the quality of services has , generally speaking , improved , in particular in regard to cross - border activity .    3.1961269689582754
the quality of services , which is so relevant to consumers , was a main concern of all speakers , some of whom , like mr rübig , were very explicit on this point .    2.816746048027546
the experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as sweden , finland and the netherlands , prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way , the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher - quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow - up .    2.5095549974618363
frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on - going standardisation of the UNK of the quality of service also contributes , as these standards will better reflect actual performance .    2.6590956625547704
this will allow for meaningful UNK - marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent UNK as a result of the combined pressure by UNK , competitors and customers .    2.209331785906381
we can see in the incumbent operators , in public post offices , a change of culture that i believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers ' needs continues .    2.304103564883318
the concerns expressed in this parliament this morning by honourable members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal .    3.5359287584555052
that proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service , the development of efficient safeguards for consumers , and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive , gradual evolution .    2.9839138150607165
the issue of universal service was mentioned by mrs isler béguin , by mr miller , whom i thank for his personal message , and by many others .    2.54303934965628
we are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion , especially in the sparsely populated rural areas , one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning .    3.0935340815049397
we believe that the universal service is a pillar and i am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee .    3.200792360171745
mrs UNK , but others like mr markov and mr UNK , voiced concerns about employment .    2.93711140115205
experience in other sectors show a sort of u - curve pattern : a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place , as , of course , the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive ; then a second phase of steady employment , as new jobs in UNK operators balance further potential employment reductions ; finally , a third phase of net job creation , both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly .    2.242541959008343
in the postal sector the first phase is already in progress , as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation .    3.043104001777935
the new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment .    3.1233344087447414
on the availability of the studies , - a point raised by mr staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to parliament in september 1999 .    2.4718749106891713
they have all been available on the commission ' s internet website since august 1999 and the commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested .    2.81227571429324
the studies have been the object of some criticism , especially on the part of the public postal services .    3.1153876994666243
i am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data .    2.3465736602702054
this was no surprise , since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection .    2.682572010566656
does that not say a lot about management ability ?    2.7376353907326325
no single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties .    2.6931473946269384
nevertheless , mr bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision - making process .    2.570228324823024
i finally come to three interventions about a subject i am supposed to know better than postal services , that is competition .    2.4882049404589606
mr purvis , i found your UNK provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth UNK .    1.950994355165709
mr medina ortega , i am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation , because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise , through UNK concentration , to private operators .    2.721631188215884
this applies both to the post and other sectors .    2.819407752230999
if i can provide one example of this sort of vigilance , it is the case of deutsche post where , following complaints and an action before the court , the commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in july .    3.0632312964652875
we have just received the reply of the german government to the observations made .    2.645773140090204
the state aid procedure covers the question of cross - UNK between monopoly letter services and commercial business UNK activities as well as the financing of deutsche post ' s numerous recent acquisitions .    2.505693337705614
i will not go into the details due to lack of time , but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses .    2.941902224715976
in a sense this is where its work begins .    2.7694747473637755
finally , mr radwan , of course , there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition .    3.151822399305679
in particular , if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest , where a member state defines a mission of public service , it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition .    2.9311401393927143
i would slightly disagree with the UNK you used when you said , mr radwan , that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition .    3.12658794306691
most companies UNK competition .    2.807357245163663
competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens , their economic interest and for their liberty .    2.708495547108679
the examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in UNK services in europe show that citizens have benefited from this .    2.255110100713732
i can only say again that commissioner bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on monday , in the appropriate committee , more competently and in much more detail .    2.8342838906143566
thank you very much , commissioner .    1.9725151098002782
pursuant to rule 42 ( 5 ) , i have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate .    3.2039733914902335
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
we shall now proceed to the vote .    2.0168894393738306
( parliament adopted the resolution ) explanations of vote    2.1965993104010293
we voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a french postal service trade union which was looking to obtain , in the event of a favourable vote , an additional time frame in which to defend employees .    2.512146769954218
this does not mean that we approve the entire contents , which are too vague and which leave out the main concern .    2.6870997313406986
the policy undertaken by the european institutions and by national governments , especially the french government , is a retrograde policy , counter to the interests of both the service users , i . e . the great majority of the population , and the postal service workers .    3.686870116431615
postal services must continue to be public services .    3.2042717278777904
all people , regardless of their location or social status , must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions .    3.0574900084771333
in organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability , and private firms must not be authorised to UNK private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities .    2.6202528673073044
consequently , the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of europe must keep their monopoly of this service .    2.6665499635577614
in order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the european union level , it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices , reducing the number of deliveries and UNK postal staff .    3.3413245529839326
the post office and , more generally , all public services must , on the other hand , recruit additional staff .    2.801343684196439
such jobs are unquestionably useful , and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in europe .    2.1896761801681333
mr president , personally i voted in favour of this resolution , because the essential thing is that the european parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation .    3.4084012203417737
if we dismantle the public service , this would be very serious , and we wish to know what are the commission ' s intentions .    4.215604514506653
saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate .    2.544049287166547
people who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so .    2.9633488209273247
postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service .    2.4100368941059553
occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day .    2.7472496425188653
we can salute them , these postmen who , whatever the weather , sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone .    2.1739638631412723
dismantling the postal service , the local communication service , would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens .    3.4713596607154575
profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion .    2.26467395308206
mr president , i voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives .    2.6678058614474396
several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman , particularly in mountain communities .    2.6195930813758306
i wholeheartedly agree .    3.101932010729438
however , it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints .    2.797838347497179
in my own country , italy , there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately itl 50 million a year per capita , or eur 25 000 , that is , a total cost of around eur 5 million .    2.3006572023255147
liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra itl 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled .    2.2913180960724566
that should UNK compensate them for UNK their contact with the postman .    2.51422804227033
mr president , i voted in favour of the resolution on european postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position i have always defended in this house , which is the need for a high quality universal service , particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions , and there are some even in my small country , the grand UNK of luxembourg .    2.968642530520655
in these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities , as mr posselt explained so clearly , post offices and postmen have an almost socio - cultural role , i might say , which goes beyond merely delivering mail .    2.1644229337331793
i know that this service is unprofitable .    2.525487274552404
in principle , i am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies , whether in water , gas , electricity , telephone , satellite , cable or any other services .    2.362978514230545
nonetheless , liberalisation , which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service , especially in the telephone sector , must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears , when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money .    2.8396412344140574
if they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee , particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service , then the public service must be protected .    2.8679566768515734
i feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service , even if our post offices operate like businesses .    2.763250760332448
they clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email .    2.783371663383923
.    2.489189446364389
( fr ) here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation .    2.2264801893175967
i am not , personally , a UNK UNK in favour of monopolies , whether public or private , but when i see the results achieved by private firms in this sector i am reinforced in my position as a defender of public service !    2.753218361468631
if liberalisation continues in this area too , then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service .    2.9247970143145334
for who can believe for one moment that private firms , motivated only by profit , will continue to provide services in high - cost areas unless the costs are borne by the already disadvantaged inhabitants who are not , therefore , in a position to take advantage of the service .    2.5960377207165823
i should add that today , at a time when europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of fascists in a government within the european union , it is no longer acceptable to have an UNK which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same europe .    2.753891726481596
i am a european and even a federalist .    2.750323073424165
to achieve this i was ready and i am ready to make certain sacrifices , but not just anything ! most especially , i am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which , in the UNK , made me a committed european !    3.166912195752075

resumption of the session    2.550836440705554
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday , 18 february 2000 .    2.4341463859894374
statement by the president    4.41295779874153
ladies and gentlemen , as you know , on 22 february , eta struck again in a brutal attack in spain with the murder of fernando buesa blanco , the general secretary of the socialist party of UNK and the spokesman of the socialist party of the basque parliament , and jorge díez elorza , his bodyguard .    2.6059728396687594
the same day , i conveyed my own and the european parliament ' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims ' families .    2.5279990636921363
these men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy .    2.3563793737718157
i utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society .    2.023565762193626
the rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the european union is based .    3.3263594950126207
terrorism , whatever form it takes , is unacceptable .    2.4749686689848738
in expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of eta , i call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in spain .    2.637028176250938
i would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , to observe one minute ' s silence in memory of fernando buesa blanco and jorge díez elorza .    2.1609223144931176
( the house rose and observed a minute ' s silence )    1.9283240791681273
madam president , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists , i want to thank you for your statement last tuesday and for your words today in memory of fernando buesa blanco .    2.2068414112821473
he was a member of the basque regional parliament , spokesman for the socialist party in that parliament and also a former vice - president of the basque regional government .    3.0482088331769117
madam president , the best tribute that my group and this house can pay to fernando buesa is to take on board his vision , as a european , of the basque country , spain and europe .    3.051282298305206
anyone of my age - i am 54 - can remember their grandparents ' era and their parents ' era and , of course , is living in the current era . we can also see into the era in which our children will live .    2.400237667828051
in my grandparents ' time , it took several days to travel from vitoria to UNK .    2.529488840770786
now you can go from vitoria to copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane .    2.099731001855282
today , at the end of the 20th century , a single market is operating in europe in which we will soon be using a single currency .    3.520539656432885
we can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within spain or even within the basque country .    2.162758312630421
we are building a vast european area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically .    2.215805793090749
this process may take a long time but it is UNK and , what is more , desirable .    3.638616668651741
the public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation .    2.9300208958961185
in a debate within the socialist party on the irish process , someone said : " in the end , the key to the irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought : does it really matter whether we are irish or british ?    2.2929235566884114
everyone can be what they want to be because , if ireland and britain are both in the european union , there is no point in killing each other for being irish or british .    3.0726082869468043
what difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function ? "    2.4578043487061025
we in the basque country could ask ourselves the same question . does it really matter if we are basque or spanish or european ?    2.5410521067072596
we have talked a lot about what it is to be basque , but a basque today UNK like a UNK and reads the same things as a british person .    2.878070220841647
if life is going to be lived on a much more global basis , as is already happening , and our children will therefore be living in the europe which we are creating , why are we killing each other for being basque or spanish ? '    2.865288878517132
fernando buesa also said the following , which everyone in ireland has probably thought . ' if we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in ireland because there were UNK groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the basque country too .    2.4326775937788696
what difference does it make to be basque ? surely it is all the same thing .    2.7106246727026586
you can be what you want to be .    3.3586434025751655
if , in the future , economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the european arena , there is no point killing or dying for being basque or spanish ' .    2.889769895668035
may he rest in peace .    2.582994814656512
( loud applause )    2.301445795846968
madam president , on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party and european democrats , i want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of fernando buesa , an elected representative of the basque people , and jorge díez , a member of the basque police force . we also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the basque socialist party .    2.7452903034828164
in recent times , in this house , we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in europe .    3.182618585062681
it does not matter what banner these come under because , in the end , they are all different expressions of the same thing .    3.054253191444344
faced with these , we democrats cannot UNK ourselves to the peace of the dead .    2.363985340196079
on the contrary , we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the basque country is the UNK which separates those who kill , and those who support and express understanding for the latter , from the vast majority of the basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom .    2.6648547301822143
( loud applause )    2.301445795846968
madam president , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , i must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 february in vitoria which took the lives of the socialist mp and spokesman in the basque parliament , fernando buesa , and his bodyguard , jorge díez .    2.053886377593401
in a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the european union , it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended , provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice , freedom and economic and social progress on which the union is based . the UNK of these principles is simply not acceptable , as clearly indicated in the treaties .    3.2696673824643074
there is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of fernando buesa and jorge díez , particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the basque people .    2.581039597575254
we pray that these are the last victims in a process which , as you said , madam president , has seen much barbarism . we pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the basque people to live together in peace .    3.041397529015213
madam president , on behalf of the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left , i must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the basque country . we send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop .    2.322354917657803
the terrorist organisation eta has , in its time , killed police officers and soldiers .    2.588486832663806
it has placed a bomb in a UNK and killed men , women and children .    2.629169271482735
in the streets of madrid it has killed a general , UNK UNK , who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981 .    2.479660724541043
it has assassinated the spokesman of the popular party in the town council of san UNK , UNK UNK .    2.4637999510058397
it has been to the lecture room of the university professor in constitutional law , UNK UNK y UNK , and killed him in cold blood . now , just a few days ago , in the same UNK way in which it assassinated UNK blanco , it has killed the socialist mp and spokesman in the vitoria parliament , fernando buesa , and his bodyguard , jorge díez , of the basque police force .    2.608143578124209
eta must be condemned . however , those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned .    2.7955800012700704
there is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road .    2.330513217542893
we must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties , whether they are national or nationalist , and no matter how pro - or anti - european they are .    2.6685026992977576
it is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident .    2.61147455139318
all european democrats in this house must join together to send a message to the basque country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing . it is time to share the basque country , spain and europe .    3.0986298259699794
this , madam president , is the only way forward which we therefore fully support .    3.3474857851615734
madam president , on behalf of the union for a europe of nations group , i would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it .    2.7634795004917723
for the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy , but i feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy , in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others , democracy and democratic life .    2.978636992024791
so , madam president , maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance .    2.6102990540990176
why does parliament not meet in all the countries of the european union and show that it rejects terrorism ?    3.19513218106776
let us make ourselves heard !    2.5695324897467873
we are not just confined to brussels or strasbourg .    2.476196468246371
let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words , but a demonstration of our actual political commitment .    2.30328264514675
madam president , as a member of the group of the greens / european free alliance and also as an mep for the basque nationalist party , i must firstly categorically condemn the UNK attack which took the lives of a basque police officer , jorge díez elorza , and the basque mp and former vice - president , fernando buesa .    2.464734238234532
secondly , we send our deepest condolences to their families , their socialist colleagues , the basque parliament and the basque police force . we also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy .    2.5478705786834754
thirdly , we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which , by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people , not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people .    2.613179754019565
fourthly , we express our UNK at the fact that this dual UNK was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the basque country .    2.6267499905352394
fifthly , we again call on the spanish and french leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the united kingdom and ireland in order to resolve the current basque conflict with something more than police measures which , on their own , cannot bring about the peace which we all desire .    2.7634277885202647
sixthly and finally , we reaffirm that eta ' s terrorism and violence must end . eta must stop UNK the will of the basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion .    2.279202679876615
just three months ago i took the floor in this house to congratulate the irish and british people on their success in reaching the northern ireland settlement , as many other colleagues did .    2.8003706094653893
in northern ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families UNK .    2.644687543003036
so far , unfortunately , in spain and france , just the opposite has been happening as regards the on - going conflict in the basque country .    2.8352326962854004
we , euskal herritarrok , are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda .    2.3750593830492925
before 20 january last , during UNK months , the only killing we witnessed in the kingdom of spain was that of josé luis UNK , member of eta , in march 1999 .    2.0247349635213046
in spite of that and the arrests made by the spanish and french police , including arrests of eta negotiators with the spanish government ' s agreement , eta honoured its unilateral ceasefire .    2.446858843414344
then , last november , before the ceasefire was over , the spanish government spokesman , mr UNK , declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the basque country .    2.5215030417536592
we , euskal herritarrok , have regretted many times the loss of human lives .    2.2697327685013526
we share with all the basque citizens the UNK of our people .    3.462956757493167
we are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the basque country .    2.594441671868166
twenty years have passed since the northern ireland question was first raised in this parliament .    2.4931945455760527
may i ask : UNK tandem - UNK UNK ?    2.761336596589533
thank you , mrs dührkop dührkop , i should like to assure you of my UNK and sincere respect .    2.5175046792020366
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.588172984177108
the minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .    2.2414930750925732
are there any comments ?    2.1658741078678636
we are about to discuss the subject of reforming the commission and you will recall , madam president , that at the beginning of the last session , i raised with you the question of whether , in the interests of openness and transparency , the members ' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the internet .    3.331850400367506
i wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to parliament that the quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the internet and , if so , whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 april - for doing so .    2.522914045896227
i can tell you , mr davies , that the bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the members ' register of financial interests on the internet and the quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve .    2.723751560914565
but we shall have a decision very soon .    2.914179803212381
( the minutes were adopted )    2.4839933770692184
reforming the commission    4.0072403055433
the next item is the commission statement on reforming the european commission .    2.3366933086215336
i shall give the floor straight away to the president , mr romano prodi .    3.159156893572494
- ( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , last july , here in your presence , i made a solemn commitment to reform the commission .    2.558475111351801
i would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last july : the UNK commission had been in crisis , i had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination .    2.421643575558471
the UNK of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the commission , to reform it thoroughly , completely UNK the commission ' s way of working .    2.932116688523556
today , that commitment has been fully discharged : you have the reform here , before you , in the form of an institutional white paper which has just been adopted by the commission .    2.939834836004312
i would like to emphasise that , on that occasion too , the commission voted unanimously , with one voice .    3.039819559690509
briefly , these are the main points of the reform .    3.8315520447488316
one : definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources .    2.103205682086744
this is at the heart of the system , and it is this , the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources , which will enable the political sphere to assert its UNK and to take its responsibilities fully on board .    3.1831916064898556
in order to do this , we have created a completely new policy - planning mechanism , a system which will allow the college to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these , to assign well - defined objectives to the directorates - general and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control , which is of fundamental importance .    3.0155111225487783
the second point is human resources .    2.6738001102188926
it is the central part of our reform . our staff are the commission ' s best asset , its richest resource .    2.604428762895075
they are extremely highly qualified , of a UNK which it is difficult , if not impossible , to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used .    3.12382695689906
however , at the same time , i have found that morale amongst the commission ' s staff is very low .    3.261301733474202
previously , there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution , but now staff are frequently UNK by the UNK criticism .    2.6710445301024075
all this has to change , and this is one of the main reasons for our reform .    3.619192976185503
recruitment , career development , mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria : there will be greater emphasis on individual service , credible and , above all , verifiable performance appraisal systems , lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility .    2.1257611796756937
these are the areas in which changes will be made .    2.862700952815968
the third point , which was also rather a sensitive , key issue in the recent crisis , is financial management .    2.7718184760412945
this is the UNK of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security .    3.1478766237778597
we are going to create a management and control system in every directorate - general .    3.1419915024483926
at the moment , our control system is completely centralised ; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system .    1.9385887944525937
this means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice , decentralisation in every directorate - general of the entire chain , that is of programmes , undertakings , contracts , expenditure and the related ex ante control systems , and an external auditing service which will direct these operations .    2.494646794826492
this is a complete revolution of the commission ' s way of working ; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking .    3.103029564266401
we are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage , and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff : we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place .    2.52987420698709
in fact , the commission UNK this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of europe and the world .    4.031576379292392
we also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology .    2.755099106008948
we want to be a model of a completely computerised administration .    3.5325621070116577
the commission has been accused of being buried under UNK of paper , and so we are going to become a UNK commission .    2.9868075560382374
this will make the commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the commission .    3.122868225379524
this is not just a technical revolution , but a complete organisational revolution as well .    2.5040698009523945
i shall leave to UNK kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform , but i would first like to thank him for the intelligence , enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise .    2.6649907410481783
we would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the commission staff , who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the commission .    2.914461251881472
i would stress that this style of debate is something very new and , in my opinion , it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well .    2.490646581894013
the white paper before us is also the product of contributions from the commission staff : they knew that the commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become , once again , that internationally - admired institution which was at the heart of european history .    3.180737763345764
the adoption of the white paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and i hope that it will remain closed forever .    3.5039979804300674
now we can focus on the future , on the challenges awaiting the union and on the programme for 2000 - 2005 , the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks .    3.904302697571283
the very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five - year plan .    2.8140046863176096
we need - the whole union needs - a strong commission , a commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions .    2.5127950364629728
this is why we are redefining all our work priorities .    2.309337347957911
this is why we are UNK all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity .    3.2667276607233697
for this reason , we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently .    3.475310532784334
we will make the best use of the resources at the commission ' s disposal , but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them .    3.6223429375655845
we may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future .    2.8832356198580187
in september , we undertook to present a white paper on reform , and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence .    2.933434768754053
the commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve .    2.4722313835025487
i would , however , remind you , and this is my final point , that the commission is not the only community institution .    4.220613444617669
parliament and the council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms .    3.0491419814583267
the commission has resolutely forged a path , and i hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end , in the service of the citizens of europe , to achieve an ever - stronger and ever more transparent europe .    3.1451090274904168
as honourable members will see from the document , which will be available to them today , the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the commission , with this parliament and with the council , which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in january , have been very productive and resulted in useful UNK .    3.5223226080806755
together with romano prodi , i express my gratitude to this house and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses .    3.1491421320519186
the white paper puts reform in its proper political context .    2.3749978918839405
in the commission , systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred .    2.573009657039061
the treaties have been revised , new managerial tasks have been attributed by this parliament and by the council to the commission , and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our union , in our continent and in the world .    3.3700904094970814
those realities , together with the approach of further enlargements , all counsel strongly for modernisation of the commission , so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development , of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness , maximum responsibility and maximum accountability .    2.465480570813855
the sustained independence and strength of the commission are , of course , basic to that mission as this house has repeatedly recognised .    3.141346957229658
reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too .    2.662659878464442
the commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind , and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere .    3.61279332907915
but the commission does exist to serve the union and its peoples with high standards of performance .    2.8625021915392805
that is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the commission want to provide and will provide .    3.5019791933671156
the house will be aware , of course , that the commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone .    3.7145034968546042
all institutions in the european union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly .    3.3111149684563266
i know that my colleagues and i can count on the support of many members of this house across the spectrum .    3.1008582315629125
one of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the commission with the resources of the commission will confront this house .    3.4396616035804577
last month , as romano prodi has just said , we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the commission and we will fully report on that in september .    2.6172429920750235
our aim is to focus the commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years .    2.5854409113333983
inevitably , that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended .    2.667179788695564
it means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the union .    2.4907193919358632
it means allocating staff to areas of high - policy importance within departments and across the commission .    2.3161721506473554
and when that assessment is complete , we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us .    2.7040052663564604
if they are proven not to be , we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority .    3.3251921258544184
if that does not meet with a positive response , the difficult issue of which of our lower - priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed , not just by the commission , but by this parliament and by the council too .    3.0864909675841607
i do not make this point because of any desire in the prodi commission to UNK from activities or responsibilities .    2.593480292825637
on the contrary , as many in this house understand , i am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability .    2.7554702844786427
that means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both .    1.8592682006827785
in each of the three pillars of reform , the active support and cooperation of this house will be absolutely vital .    3.0589363024766185
the new activity - based management system , that the president just mentioned , will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time .    2.891728184956784
the role of the budgetary authority in the operation of UNK will , therefore , be vital .    3.3614250608141876
attempts to micro - manage the commission ' s operations are clearly in no one ' s interest .    3.0179456359717647
a UNK and practical interinstitutional agreement will , therefore , be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity - based management .    2.747459829645239
in human resources policy , the involvement of parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the commission is accountable .    3.3187285636435786
and finally , in the crucial area of financial management where the court of auditors , the committee of independent experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change , the support of this house in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance .    2.719196403043737
in the limited time available for this statement , it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals .    3.0698496326422644
i have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years , and i certainly look forward to the questions of honourable members this afternoon .    3.3536441120052713
it is clear , of course , that in many ways the really hard work starts now , with the implementation of our proposals .    3.354865479040968
thank you , commissioner kinnock .    2.405210422417943
we shall now move on to question time .    2.5296534670011543
madam president , the commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials .    2.703365823842406
recently , the immunity of a former commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in brussels on the basis that brussels is the seat of the community institutions .    2.3260095187835605
yet these institutions have other seats and , given that the community ' s actions affect the whole community territory , there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials , commissioners and so on .    2.8085897606716377
is the commission aware that , in order to lift immunity , it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding commission officials accountable , including former and current commissioners ?    3.0981823226276264
there is effective legal precaution .    2.6824740246752117
in the particular case that the honourable member has in mind , not only did the commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former commissioner , but the former commissioner herself advised the commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted .    2.5191148862481065
i can see the complexities that concern the honourable member , but i say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted , and every single one of those requests has been met , and met with UNK .    2.778309442321158
i think that the house can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded , but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every member state in seeking to get information , or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the commission .    2.3535503066264165
and i make the point , before i move to my questions , that what happens concerning the staff regulations in the commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because , of course , the european parliament staff operate under the same conditions .    2.7382558335863205
that will form part of the work that we will have to do and i sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process .    3.622151736104083
now there were two points i wanted to pick up with mr kinnock , if i may .    2.7179409284393166
the first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms .    2.280179404512654
mr prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the commission about low morale and low motivation , and clearly that is a major concern .    2.8186935811486227
big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the commission and outside .    3.1680211310521447
and if we are to move forward , i suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side , early evidence of change of culture , UNK and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later .    2.5633958650342077
and if we look at the original proposals - and i suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the staff regulations .    3.45883323752632
indeed , it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced .    3.3695586319115227
i suggest that is too long , and we really must move forward much more quickly than that .    2.9531414382121275
the second point that i want to make concerns information technology .    2.98916545368329
have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about , because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms .    2.4944609244742275
on the second part of mr harbour ' s question , he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change , not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the commission , as the president briefly outlined in his statement .    3.076277623364422
could i thank mr harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale , the motivation and the professional commitment of commission officials , which is already very strong , will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training , the allocation of responsibility , the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing .    2.826223089779963
cultures are products of structures and systems , and the structures and systems have become old .    2.9179499271480815
i would like to make one last point in answer to mr harbour .    2.3341405018691277
i share his UNK to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices .    2.768373955815776
we indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and i believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms , these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake UNK .    2.5430245714098403
i would like everything to happen much more quickly .    2.4550136825207862
it is better to do it absolutely properly .    2.705941576717246
madam president , we admire mr kinnock ' s vision and sense of realism . for he is holding up visions of a well - UNK and effective administration and is , at the same time , drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated .    2.3127599348513397
mr prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities .    3.8724649760948515
we will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first .    2.914286641285698
i think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities , because i can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise .    2.782299155227567
enlargement - that is enlargement of the union - is one of the key challenges in this context .    3.6099088506965464
i would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace , it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board .    2.8515256331990138
we must resolutely switch from our present , rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace .    2.299548667140962
could mr kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the council and parliament to come up with for these priorities ?    2.5951376547111504
i am grateful to mrs maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this house .    2.33393845192733
can i assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out .    2.0581642550278585
we are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities , not in order to UNK any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have .    2.9476081971775367
one of those obligations very clearly - and i am at one with mrs maes in this - is in the preparation for effective , smooth , calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current union .    3.1306479045019002
one of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect .    2.8335976688297806
can i say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity - based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any UNK .    2.2807978284505426
since i was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised , i may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our UNK view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the union and its enlargement .    3.483217330705853
i hope that , in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the council and with parliament , not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way , but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the union .    3.4367592180333695
i do believe that reform with all it implies , including the new mechanisms , will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind .    2.2270533885732116
i would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial white paper with the accompanying action plan and i think when the president of the commission described his vice - president as acting with intelligence , enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure .    2.6398599369394606
two questions if i may .    2.9740162895381443
we anticipate , if i understand correctly , a report in september on core activities .    2.536659176798915
will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the commission UNK such a procedure ?    2.9307527088684813
secondly , on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures , do i understand correctly - and i have not had the opportunity to UNK into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the commission is indeed to empower the directorates - general to liberate them from the ex ante UNK system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system ?    2.8112383329747224
if that is the case i can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own group , i believe that if we have demanded in this house as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the commission , its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers .    3.3861274661866547
let the managers manage .    2.692204737933563
i want to thank mr cox and indeed his group for the way in which several members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always , as he indicated , worthwhile .    2.277859687536122
so far as the september communication is concerned , it is unprecedented .    3.9908359839056224
it will not be just one of the UNK that the commission has UNK undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within directorates - general and across the commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands .    3.428103079936127
it is conceivable therefore - i cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which parliament is engaged we may have to - i emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision .    2.455172007717271
that is a sensible forecast to make , it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain .    3.780853649311261
can i thank mr cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the committee of independent experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control .    2.865086383790776
i would emphasise , too , that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to " UNK " - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means .    3.6171652226650948
in undertaking such a development in our organisation i am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations , both in the public sector and in the private sector , in the last decade or so .    2.845440250607693
i think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any UNK of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks .    2.4034371825597485
financial control will be absolutely secured , both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes , and because we will introduce a completely professional , independent internal audit service .    2.9615557948255384
as i said earlier , our ambition is total security for money and value for money .    2.1350451282216474
we are also interested in value for the people who work for us .    2.751997885742202
the changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that .    2.6732256999424178
i am also grateful , at the risk of being UNK , to mrs theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which , if she will allow me to say so , she played UNK to many of the changes which we are now contemplating .    3.3611037774235055
i hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part UNK .    2.3431500691398597
first of all , i am not sure if i got the interpretation properly , but i do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as mrs theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control .    2.8080191968053008
however , because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control , and audit under the present terms , it is very difficult to think of this as an UNK role , no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it .    2.660259915333085
so , the changes that we seek to make - as i say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the committee of independent experts - are not negative in any way at all .    2.6691700248406023
coherence , consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures .    2.466990785632761
one is to ensure high quality training , another is to ensure that no directorate - general can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the UNK of the system , another is the establishment of a central financial service , as honourable members will see from the white paper , to ensure that those standards are set and supervised , and there is also the additional belt and UNK and UNK approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service .    2.7840734151206834
   3.702094057753363
i will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but i am certain that on examination mrs theato will be able to see that in the details of the white paper , there are very strong assurances .    3.3520297936157695
there will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this house particularly in the committee on budgetary control , and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in directorates - general .    3.5987253696433283
if that is felt in a directorate - general to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control , the ex ante system can be used .    2.7845067812318964
naturally , there are diverse requirements across the commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular directorates - general have to engage .    2.887007442947723
account is taken of that too in the white paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system , it most certainly can be used .    3.3600445246070305
lastly on transition , i share the reservations of mrs theato over so - called " soft law " .    2.4162233904918646
we have had this discussion before and she knows i make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what i suppose we could call " hard law " .    2.0868810929184245
but , on this issue , i do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this house and in the council .    3.1571984300588882
there are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the white paper .    2.6183466649138323
in addition , however , and very importantly , because it is a transition period , there will be training , there will be advice , there will be support , there will be assurances .    3.6591290702371344
the new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 may and with that and an accumulation of other assurances i think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition .    2.6454369169409566
two other points i must make , because this is an essential question central to reform .    3.351716588420146
the first one is that people feel - for reasons i well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia .    2.2878637329409233
irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline .    2.542659952852726
i completely reject that simply because of the standards of commission officials , the responsibility of directors - general and the assurances that we have built into the system .    2.8801792694813058
inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring .    3.042683577725906
lastly , the system we currently have - as the committee of independent experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable .    2.6728180366116563
indeed the court of auditors has called it fiction .    2.7754805932287083
change will have to come in any case , change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one friday to the next monday from one system to another .    2.6540465293422266
in so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have , i am certain that we have installed , or that we will UNK on the basis of our proposals , a system that will provide the union , its taxpayers and this house with complete security .    3.9357010981459193
madam president , great importance has been attached to the reform process , which deserves to be acknowledged , although this may be somewhat premature .    2.6588575489508868
my question is this : there is a need for reform , due not least to the accession of new countries , and thus to the enlargement of the union .    2.9943050782848974
how can we - the commission , parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively , taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries ?    3.119891610597183
how can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the european parliament , the national parliaments and also the commission , and the work they perform together , more effective ?    4.05600475973229
i am grateful to the honourable member for underlining the fact that , apart from its own inherent merits , reform will be made necessary by accession , the enlargements , and particularly the kind of enlargements that our union will shortly be engaging in .    2.54804931295807
it is essential that we have that reform , both for the sake of the current union , and certainly to facilitate UNK .    3.381657839130014
in the course of the coming years i will be continuing the practice i have already started , together with several of my commission colleagues obviously , of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new member states .    2.598831086919042
we are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering .    3.0940615548026793
i would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current member states and by the union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the commission and officials and UNK in the member states have to deal with the realities , the complex realities of membership of the union and the single market , it will be difficult to see the joins .    3.6306052932236006
that is the level of UNK and provision i would like to see .    3.825808721946073
all i can do now is to promise to strive for it .    2.7262695852261847
can i start by wishing the commissioner a very happy st david ' s day .    2.3380209643930625
thank you for the presentation .    3.0051821258101343
it is important that the commission never UNK sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it UNK with the european public .    3.4075608257717063
that really has to be the sharp focus the whole time .    3.383223184771428
it has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays i am sure will be very welcome , but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork . excessive paperwork .    2.521759604454609
is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to european funding whilst ensuring financial control ?    2.016790464169738
that is a clear complaint that we get .    2.9523048958568667
that needs to be addressed .    3.351378564934014
the other question i would like to ask is on the audit progress committee .    3.175620964292199
this , of course , is welcome , but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the european parliament within our discharge procedure .    3.5595925115656937
will you be adding that into your audit progress committee ' s work ?    2.6117885603231064
finally , the socialist group agrees with activity - based budgeting and with UNK and you will be judged , as mr prodi says , by your actions , not your words .    2.72472251121443
the mission of UNK with the european public is critical as mrs morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words .    3.16541363298868
i say that with some UNK in the european parliament where there are so many experts in words , but we will try to lead by example .    3.6519558458560226
as far as excessive paper is concerned , the dilemma is UNK out by mrs morgan .    2.7874799672028194
we UNK the excess of paper , but given the requirements that we have to check and re - check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control , sometimes the requirements of administration , which some call bureaucracy , are unavoidable .    2.787631794807077
in order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum , we are not just talking about it ; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary - general , an additional deputy secretary - general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper , so much bureaucracy and i must say so much frustration , not only for the citizens and businesses of the union but for the people who work for the commission too .    2.7718887314527016
we shall certainly strive in order to do that and i think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent .    3.301591244630433
one of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform , the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the european parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the commission to properly serve the people of europe .    3.018717328639136
i know i can rely on everyone here .    2.4306729628963253
that concludes question time .    2.3954164037117547
i should like to thank president prodi and commissioner kinnock .    2.6699363352316876
statement by the high representative for common foreign and security policy    2.9203501020205977
the next item is the statement by the high representative for common foreign and security policy .    2.0429322988793035
please give a very warm welcome to mr javier solana to whom i shall hand over without further delay .    2.1852006851376458
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again , here in the european parliament .    2.8138099248007036
much has happened since the last time i was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent .    2.5883406068780697
sometimes we may feel that too much has happened .    2.53623308572419
this afternoon i should like to share with you some ideas , particularly on the common foreign and security policy .    2.655284762409533
the world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred . however , i will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me .    2.430471101682197
in recent months , since the last time i appeared before you , important events have occurred in this house and also in the european union . i would remind you of two of these events , one of which is very dear to you all as members of this parliament , and particularly to the president .    3.657901745159923
the events in kosovo and the balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds . there are also important issues at stake in the middle east in which the president of this house played a major role on her recent trip .    2.889896536343607
certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between europe and africa in which i was pleased to participate in cooperation with the portuguese presidency . a vital meeting has also taken place in portugal , in UNK , with the eighteen countries of latin america to try and develop a deeper relationship between the european union and latin america .    3.0041099092549355
chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and i will speak briefly on this at the end , in the light of an important conversation which i had this morning with the council of europe representative , mr álvaro gil - robles , on his recent visit to the region .    3.203724142221125
however , i realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in europe since helsinki .    2.2411003096108186
i will speak of this briefly . if you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time , i will be pleased to answer them .    2.8479559027135326
the helsinki summit under the finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago .    2.525066882096256
decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent .    2.4699675133834895
these were essentially of three types which i will describe .    2.610796158981862
the first is a political and security committee , the second is a military committee representing the chiefs of staff of the fifteen member states and the third committee is to make decisions on the european union ' s relations with third countries and other organisations .    3.194713805718169
this basically involves relations between the european union and the atlantic alliance and relations between the european union and those countries which , although geographically in europe , are not part of the european union , or at least not at the moment .    3.3874751447073206
i will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events .    2.6877312761082828
firstly , with regard to the decision - making bodies , the political and security committee met for the first time this morning , 1 march 2000 . this committee was established by the last general affairs council .    3.0406304694305883
therefore , two months after the helsinki declaration and decision , a political and security committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the european union .    2.6658311208878134
i was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch .    2.610417951674926
you can be satisfied with the progress made .    3.0442247429025473
the fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months .    3.138795215228823
secondly , the military committee , which represents the various chiefs of staff of the fifteen countries , will hold its first meeting on 7 march which will be just over two months after the helsinki declaration .    2.3976120859722014
this military committee , as you can imagine , will have various duties .    3.15114549084664
in the interim stage , its basic duty will be to advise the council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will , of course , try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next .    3.01878737766403
thirdly , the military staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries . together with myself , this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare , with the assistance of the military committee , any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the european union .    2.3799890966868418
this crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the military committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces .    2.3569035761049517
mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics , not for military purposes , but with strictly humanitarian ends .    2.4566056901033386
we are therefore working diligently in this respect . madam president , if , a few months ago when i had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time , i had told you that i would be able to announce on 1 march 2000 that the first meeting of the political committee had been held today , that the military committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the military staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use , many of you would surely have thought that the high representative was going mad .    3.1856424728959807
we are not mad . what we have done is to work long and hard , with determination and , without a shadow of a doubt , with the support not only of yourselves but also of the heads of state and government of the countries which you represent .    2.8721067280008334
few initiatives within the european union can have been progressed with such determination , drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since helsinki .    2.6139985832034083
in less than two months we have established the UNK for cooperation with the commission .    3.0514162543820538
europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis . i must repeat that the european union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace .    3.2283999767292313
it will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days , or two months , to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year . this is a major operation and an important objective but i can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the heads of state and government posed in helsinki .    2.8045029505526764
on monday , just two days ago , in sintra , a beautiful city very close to lisbon , the defence ministers of the fifteen member states met and took some important decisions towards implementing this headline goal defined in helsinki .    2.101327693902826
the proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us , including this house .    2.431688060089051
i will set this out in five points .    2.484176566023245
firstly , before the next general affairs council which will take place this month , we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the headline goal , bearing in mind the views that the military UNK may consider appropriate .    2.8422594893758086
to say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace .    3.0764207313689913
before 24 march we will therefore have established this timetable so that the general affairs council can , on this date , do its job and do it well .    2.5661132267697124
secondly , we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries .    2.5456518683808653
thirdly , we must look at the differences between the headline goal and what each country can provide .    2.8702131154910924
we may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs .    3.2834193156874263
how can we do this ?    3.046861552538167
this should be decided by a conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen member states .    3.352736477895662
madam president , the timetable must ensure that , by december of this year during the french presidency , the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match . we will then be able to say UNK that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available .    3.306441439210239
this is what we are doing and we are committed to this .    3.3042210786636885
we have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the portuguese presidency , which is clearly carrying out excellent work , and during the french presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions .    2.879325783931737
i would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four european councils , those in lisbon and feira and two during the french presidency .    2.707216487622422
on these four occasions , the heads of government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that , by the year 2003 , we are able to deploy what we have agreed , if necessary .    3.4242902887525366
madam president , we are therefore working on this issue with determination , energy and the full support of all the governments and all the heads of government .    3.466329648161995
i have two further points to make on this process .    2.520783034944143
the european union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which i have referred which , although geographically in europe , are not members of the european union .    3.0006717960445215
we have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises , which i hope will not be the case , all forces and all countries will be more than welcome .    3.040541206250083
secondly , we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with nato . the operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types .    3.6004486827150552
the first type will be operations in which european forces are involved within the framework of nato . the second will be operations involving european forces and directed by them , but using the means and infrastructure of nato .    2.3457772865067295
the third will be operations in which the european forces act alone . in the first and second types we will need to cooperate with nato and must therefore establish a transparent , positive and confident relationship between ourselves and nato , as appropriate , which will be good for both the alliance and ourselves .    2.7057966478440973
madam president , i have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide , the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months .    3.339923170114198
however , we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well .    2.363699629050037
as far as possible , we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in kosovo and the balkans .    2.788070078774463
we are working in this direction with the commission and commissioner patten .    3.850005975779425
on saturday morning i will meet with all the ministers for home affairs of the fifteen member states to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well .    2.9522676475337324
there are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that , after a few months , a police force is needed rather than a military force . then , in the final moments of the crisis , it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police .    2.535535437561975
in this respect we are also working closely and positively with the commission .    2.728241923632487
i am not going to say much more on these issues .    2.699991616632883
many other events have taken place in recent weeks which i should like to mention , such as in kosovo , the middle east and chechnya . there are also many other issues which i should like to discuss with you .    3.5608508607970184
however , i would prefer , madam president , to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that i have time to answer them .    3.283655596951568
however , before this happens , i must tell you about a telephone conversation which i had a few hours ago with the council of europe representative on the subject of chechnya .    3.0075758696795916
mr gil - robles returned this morning from chechnya where he visited grozny . when we spoke he gave me his initial UNK which are not good , as you can imagine .    2.3933575325248757
the situation in the refugee camps in ingushetia is poor and deteriorating .    2.3383967568620054
in most cases there is no hot food during the day as the russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non - governmental organisations .    2.567688829709854
in grozny , there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat .    2.4705687940034475
yet there is one positive point which i must share with you .    2.932884224733693
mr gil - robles told me that , when talking with the acting president and the foreign affairs minister last night , the russian authorities had agreed to allow council of europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the russian authorities . the latter were also in negotiation with the chairman - in - office of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe to allow osce representatives to be involved as well , if feasible .    2.5175219553950123
these are the only positive aspects which i can tell you about at the moment .    2.8344737736657786
i hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from commissioner gil - robles and , in particular , better news from the russian authorities .    2.9179419233883186
madam president , this brings me to the end of my speech .    3.1520687549917157
i would just like to repeat what i said at the beginning .    2.783742220237679
i am delighted to be participating in the work of this house and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the commission . this work has one clear objective of allowing our european union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations .    3.0730790578383873
europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world .    2.9314570939920443
thank you very much indeed , mr solana . i shall now give the floor to mr poettering , on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats .    2.416105732601779
thank you , mr poettering .    2.545881133260028
mr poettering , it goes without saying that commissioner patten ' s participation in this debate is most opportune , and we have agreed that i will allow him to speak when he so wishes .    3.0614978837857434
commissioner , would you like to speak now or a little later ?    2.771487184014504
( the commissioner indicated that he would speak later ) very well , thank you .    2.5656499164075592
madam president , commissioner patten , mr javier solana , UNK no es una persona UNK , UNK UNK UNK ( you are not mad , quite the opposite ) .    2.6986150391852437
we are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the helsinki summit .    2.8072606496016896
we know that you have an important role in this .    3.5518108739340377
i am also very pleased that you have mentioned mozambique today , and in this context , and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question .    3.47135423086897
we cannot , of course , talk about foreign policy without mentioning chechnya .    2.798746334106917
my friend jacques poos will be talking about this on behalf of my group .    2.5702103803001783
i want to concentrate on kosovo .    2.8717387492939945
it is now quite clear that the situation in kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means .    2.908367256009789
the kfor forces have made , and are making , an invaluable contribution , but tanks and fire UNK cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term .    2.193119032139193
it has now reached the point where the UNK has prohibited american forces from returning to northern mitrovica .    2.2110181183346524
they have now been replaced by robust danish , finnish and swedish troops .    2.2113367386811706
it is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred , but it is important for the sake of kosovo , the balkans and europe that we do not fail .    3.287307082270591
through the stability pact , we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation .    3.0350879213856032
this is therefore a test of credibility for the union ' s common foreign and security policy .    2.826240673280877
at the moment , there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in kosovo .    2.834711450192965
last autumn , we already heard mr bernard kouchner call for a civilian police force .    2.6454249379887336
i am now delighted to hear that , this weekend , mr javier solana is to call the UNK ministers together to discuss the question of policing .    2.75458876360753
i hope that this discussion will , in the first place , concentrate upon kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied .    2.8649829241583293
when it comes to the balkans and kosovo , i also hope that the council will comply with parliament ' s and , as i understand it , also the commission ' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in kosovo .    3.716504754157646
the situation in kosovo has taught us a lot , for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management , an idea which has already been translated into practical action .    3.106241614297115
another , at least as important , lesson of our experience , however , is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently .    3.4483453557145416
therefore , the eu must also have an independent , credible conflict - prevention capacity .    2.7053755151517316
on behalf of the commission , commissioner patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction .    3.370677466853625
i am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non - military operations and to introduce headline goals for non - military operations , together with a commission crisis centre .    2.619540188463407
my last question to mr solana is this : what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind ?    2.9899099647216745
how have these been organised by mr solana ' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the commission ?    2.5733195256578436
mr president , mr solana , you have the full support and confidence of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders .    2.668290401862503
i am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian , peace - keeping and peace - making tasks .    2.20648972461226
but i am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new european cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between nato and the eu or between the united states and europe .    2.879427418870737
such a split would only delight the UNK and UNK states which threaten freedom and human rights .    2.65581968326106
i believe you heard the concerns which some members of the american congress expressed last week here in parliament .    2.70019837773991
you must lay these concerns to rest for , as you yourself have said , when we are able to present a united transatlantic front , we are in a position to do something .    3.671936736478365
when we are divided , we are weakened , and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged .    3.27652615173664
so , maintain as close contact as possible with our american allies and do not forget norway , turkey and canada , either .    2.2737061838539065
you also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper UNK .    2.6634912334376364
as UNK UNK has said so often , we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into kosovo .    2.6393402223322595
it may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war .    2.677460397703553
diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats .    2.4413789760679387
everything else is UNK thinking .    2.688467705318538
that is why the member states must either authorise more expenditure or UNK their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment . we are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last monday in sintra .    2.5118986672152706
the third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny .    2.615423675158417
this should be exercised first and foremost in the member states .    2.884489555306193
it is therefore wrong for people to talk about a european army .    2.7586725152841574
it will be a force comprised of various national units .    2.8132137817263043
what is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment .    2.5742432926918584
however , there is , of course , also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the european parliament .    3.1170302660984053
as someone who both speaks and UNK , we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy .    2.6335882793678316
finally , i should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion .    2.2215470451046553
yesterday , a few of us met the portuguese defence minister .    2.724620111272408
he was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much .    2.6029500764379634
bear in mind that there are also non - aligned countries at the negotiating table .    3.0031768664875576
we share your delight , as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is UNK .    2.406476102098162
there is one thing i shall again finally emphasise : that the purpose of all this is , of course , that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all .    2.5107810752083033
that is the purpose of all this , and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with mr patten , for it is military , economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries .    2.799782204525227
mr president , mr solana , we are all behaving like children .    3.068514890673971
you are building UNK in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers .    2.8826208523940906
it is extraordinary what decisions we took in sintra concerning 2004 , 2005 , 2006 .    1.9764135303768666
but what about kosovo in the year 2000 ?    2.78253437390442
you have spoken to mr gil - robles . i have received an e - mail from a former colleague , pierre UNK , who is in pristina at the moment .    2.5834015211777492
he tells the story of a serbian doctor who has just been murdered in pristina .    2.2695554828573425
he treated roma , albanians and serbs and that is something unforgivable in kosovo .    2.7207148627758926
a man with three children and he was murdered .    2.324669287328321
we need policemen in kosovo right now !    2.3910946003587883
we need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice .    2.7288382665162314
i am not a warmonger , but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in kosovo , then what is the point in having soldiers at all ?    2.8229507280133492
people may have to risk their lives in kosovo , but that is the price of freedom at the moment .    3.6083247938862764
if we allow what is happening today in kosovo to continue - border provocation , serbian provocation , albanian provocation , etc . we are heading for war .    2.3806018502776296
tell me , what civilian forces are being mobilised , mr patten ?    2.361154999161591
we need a civilian task force in kosovo now to monitor what is happening , and to tell the military and the police what they must do , otherwise everything we did in bosnia and everything we did in kosovo will be UNK by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence .    2.501596806187067
( interruption from the extreme right by mr martinez ) we have a major problem , because we are providing travel warrants for the people , but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis , as in chechnya .    3.3462048577840955
mr poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so .    2.7639722087100904
he is not always right , but in this case he is .    3.5285085822158737
i am in favour of a UNK policy against austria , but we shall then have a responsibility towards russia .    3.195782222477811
i do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are german and from my party , whether they are french from the broad left or whether they are italians from any party !    2.2165449883661634
in the current situation , we should say to the russians " if you want money , if you want us to reduce your debts , you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into russia " .    2.8905332900207723
if not , we are not prepared to pay for their war , since , by reducing the debt , by giving them money , we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres .    3.1110357446211587
it is not enough just to say , " you , the murderers , please stop the slaughter ! "    2.5915973306315765
they know full well that they should not commit these acts .    2.770504833353666
do you think that mr putin does not know that what he is doing in chechnya is not good ?    2.6761854636014095
but that is his strategy , he instigated this war .    2.5147651230573955
from the beginning , he wanted this war in order to become president .    3.1920508607657894
so that is the world as it is today .    3.6484357737005393
for that reason i say to you : my group is not entirely in agreement , but i am in favour of european defence .    3.212367594164362
i believe that european defence should be scrutinised by the european parliament and by the national parliaments .    3.151411545625872
first of all , the european parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers .    2.7869557808643006
if a civilian task force can , at the same time , intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step , we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers , but who are incapable of sending in civilians .    2.3118474676231573
as long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements , we shall not be credible .    3.098204028451308
mr president , mr solana , we are very uneasy about UNK to you because , in our view , you are responsible for an area that does not really exist .    3.4836283046883727
we believe that poor old europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or , and this is possibly more serious , that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply UNK along with american politics .    2.3690716703321164
in the UNK mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of , at sintra , the fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is ' UNK ' called autonomous .    2.2868833794330774
now , the union can certainly call the body an ' action force ' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the UNK - on paper - of men , weapons and logistics .    2.8115091545434714
but to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether .    2.6768049163823755
what interests will this so - called force defend , in view of the fact that the countries of europe do not have the same interests ?    3.4845321159059064
what is the basis of armed action ?    3.235910497546947
it is the defence of a territory , the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital ?    2.8193022069278286
just what is an army in the absence of a home country , in the absence of territory - because europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests , which the fifteen have , for good reason , never dared to discuss .    2.695910929662739
in short , what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy ?    2.567647385260128
we fall back on a kind of UNK army based on humanitarian rights , a kind of army in the service of vague ideas , of an ideal , the dangers of which have many times been shown in history .    2.2886945041480775
a foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one ' s own interests .    2.3721590930174874
but the cfsp will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system .    2.20480933358388
who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the UNK formed by london and berlin , UNK by their respective UNK , and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of washington , seeing themselves at best as bit - part players .    2.5115783425773817
mr solana , you yourself are a perfect illustration of this , as it were , structural complicity , passing smoothly from nato to the cfsp as if they were one and the same . of course , in reality , they are the same thing .    2.9097349247671556
it is still the old imperial service .    2.7940097653762677
it is not without some UNK that we have seen you , in your pathetic UNK with mr patten , present this delightful and most charming argument : one day you told a german newspaper , " i am the one that the americans phone up " .    2.4464700934173425
you might have added , mr solana , ' to give me their instructions ' , because that is what we see , in fact .    2.83007327170555
in the case of the balkans , just like everywhere else , one day the united states wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it .    2.5112301428790005
yes , jean - UNK martinez was indeed right to interrupt you , UNK cohn - bendit . in every case , it is follow - my - leader syndrome .    2.170625847255014
do you think i am going over the top ?    2.830530466974571
every day the news brings more proof of our UNK .    2.453052745945713
echelon is one of many examples of this , giving an image of europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here .    3.1269596923262744
the experts speak of a cultural problem , i think they might be right !    2.83105180761999
on behalf of the combined european right , i must say to you , mr solana , as high representative for common foreign and security policy , we do not have confidence in you .    3.2541020711566317
you say that you are against war , but as secretary - general of nato you started a war .    2.6475848382445117
a war of aggression , UNK carrying out american military policy , in a sphere that was not that of the north atlantic treaty , against a state that had never been a member , that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non - interference as well as those governing the declaration of war .    2.649224609887685
today , even mr cohn - bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for .    2.433320214216311
we also have several questions to ask you that show our concern , that is the least one can say .    2.920494111888189
first of all , in your view , does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the member states of the union , as one might think , or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world ?    2.9816329496443017
secondly , if you do recognise this right , then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on ?    2.4952526234094448
i can already hear your reply : humanitarian standards .    2.2409923201352946
in kosovo , it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in serbia .    2.61107148315874
when the us killed 2 000 people in UNK , it was not to impose their politics , it was to combat drug trafficking .    3.1927449807973063
when they landed in UNK , before having to withdraw in UNK , it was not to guarantee their UNK of the oil route , it was to restore hope .    3.482769488288506
in a nutshell , can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons .    2.2453901859581635
finally , you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management .    2.424700845403567
not to make war , of course , but to protect peace .    3.5514430096875786
but these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions .    2.146154922088972
can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any state you care to mention , particularly those which , in their elections , do not ratify the policy adopted by the other member states of the union ?    3.023860922197498
mr solana , these questions convey our concern .    2.5236551480555747
as candidate countries of the european union , they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning , that is to say as of now .    2.9214485106467842
this request , however , was not honoured by the council at its helsinki summit at the end of last year . in the finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation .    2.767210914152908
this is why i would like to ask the high representative , mr solana , to what extent UNK , UNK and budapest are , or will be , involved in european military crisis management plans .    3.0173351415834797
given poland ' s rather critical stance , this question is all the more pressing .    2.4893208969503267
its reservation is UNK in the following , rather blunt wording : avoid american UNK and european UNK .    2.512931552413832
as one might expect , the polish foreign affairs minister , mr UNK geremek , has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms : " the development of a european defence identity should not be at the expense of nato ' s unity .    2.933551709208336
if anything , the european defence identity should serve to strengthen nato " .    3.243118698167423
we all very much share this opinion .    2.73929648793489
minister geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new nato members from central and eastern europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today .    2.3379993517425937
the czech defence minister , for example , shares this opinion . in the autumn of last year , the latter stated : " security within europe is not UNK .    2.94795585224491
it cannot be restricted to a small number of countries , with others only being allowed to observe or UNK decisions " .    2.3529665890735263
these opinions add substance to my question addressed to mr solana .    2.6732235594839633
UNK only need five words for this : nothing about us without us !    2.290335854381723
what do the current eu member states intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries ?    2.642609350013381
mr president , i too welcome the presence of the high representative and his availability to answer members ' questions this time round . on his first appearance in november this was not possible , although this was not mr solana ' s fault .    2.346007134555889
it should be acknowledged , however , that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by members .    2.738751107982044
we should also acknowledge the efforts which mr solana is making towards achieving a more effective , visible and coherent common foreign and security policy for the european union .    2.5935283874706156
in this respect , i agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian , diplomatic , humanitarian and police elements , to which mr solana referred .    2.6538170121913938
the portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies .    2.607954588925219
in record time it has organised this informal meeting of defence ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this common foreign and security policy .    1.932385000358571
this meeting was based on two documents , one being a british document on the headline goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the european union .    2.465557541012408
mr solana , would you be prepared , at your next appearance before the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit ? i should like to ask mr patten and , through you , the president - in - office to also attend and answer the same question .    2.3742093456843305
secondly , to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the french defence minister that the member states had to allocate 0 . 7 % of gdp to defence expenditure ?    2.6658129102878374
i would like to hear your opinion . do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the member states in this respect ?    2.657803460378951
thirdly , what assessment would you make of the ' UNK 2000 ' exercises which have just ended in which , for the first time , the european union took part in a series of initiatives with the north atlantic treaty organisation ?    2.946598083135555
fourthly and finally , if the member states asked for this , would you be prepared to chair the political and security committee ? in this way you could contribute all your experience as secretary - general of the council of ministers , high representative for common foreign and security policy , secretary - general of the western european union and a former secretary - general of nato .    2.9021950304291844
mr solana , as the rapporteur of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , i shall limit my speech to those subjects .    2.806954615246531
you have , mr solana , heard the force of the criticisms made by the members of parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in kosovo , chechnya and elsewhere .    3.16357125642589
for my part , i do not wish to give up hope .    3.410056211436784
and today , as far as you are concerned , i acknowledge your efforts to build a european security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed .    3.152503193860371
indeed , we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective , in any case , the objective that i wish to achieve .    3.3008600443486293
but i do give you credit for your intense work , the number of meetings held , your efforts to create a rapid intervention force , your specific efforts to prevent crises , to manage them or stop them through civilian means and , if necessary , by military means .    2.2555630508259528
i should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the " what is to be done " variety .    2.931499900665577
the first concerns the forthcoming european councils in june and december , without counting the extraordinary council meeting in lisbon .    2.0070624030266355
what are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings ?    2.497698509588292
and finally , what do you most need at these next UNK ?    2.4084385066702216
my second question is different , although it is not UNK with the previous one .    3.664013717514056
it concerns the next igc .    2.9936047090044724
i believe that the italian president of the council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 february .    2.8046694318219507
can you tell us your position on this subject ?    3.253094087642605
mr president , bosnia and kosovo have shaken europe .    2.2343285956209606
at long last , the european union UNK that it cannot afford to always give the americans the political and military initiative .    3.1462571448228007
however , if europe wants to take military action at crucial times , the treaty must include a flexibility clause .    2.354991315089424
mr solana can play an important role in this .    2.876257617827248
he is not stupid . certainly not !    2.525534097192097
he is a driven man , a competent man .    2.3541735100653858
but the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence .    2.2857187618536323
in addition to being secretary - general of the council , mr solana is also secretary - general of the weu , as well as high representative for the common foreign and security policy . he also heads the unity policy planning and the new early warning unit .    2.760391621324241
one wonders whether he gets any time to UNK , mr president .    3.058713584594695
from a democratic point of view , i actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable . this is exacerbated by the fact that mr solana is , of course , not a democratically elected politician , but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament .    3.023399929179617
his position threatens to UNK that of commissioner patten , as has been illustrated again today , in fact .    3.1238626030004513
it appears that , as european security and defence policy takes shape , the commission and parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold .    3.111593272384947
naturally , every attempt should be made to make european policy more efficient , but this should not lead to UNK - for concentrations of power .    2.926328165275312
mr solana must keep europe awake without UNK off himself .    2.1827710865013725
mr president , peace is the european union ' s very raison d ' être . i am pleased about the fact that commissioner patten and mr solana have already underlined this repeatedly .    2.9216127935602363
we have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy , cultural diversity and tolerance .    2.5047419139503084
some of them are our acp partners .    2.9303163727391417
the war is an extension of UNK underdevelopment .    2.8428245711628635
in kosovo , we stepped in with military means , having been unable to prevent the war in ex - yugoslavia .    2.8181422629250954
we are now unable to guide the peace .    2.489926924790254
this is why europe is not credible as a union .    2.634266086871097
i do not believe , mr solana , that we can restore this credibility by military means .    3.0616072988296517
as representatives from the group of the greens / european free alliance , we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries , but we always needed to fight those who came to UNK us .    2.28517992211194
we are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term . this is not because we are against european defence , but european defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound , democratically - based decision process in respect of foreign affairs .    2.489911649144312
at the moment , europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of .    2.968597191955009
i can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level .    2.753922935717458
in my opinion , it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment , which are such nice toys , after all .    2.679086611935605
because our borders do not stop at the mediterranean sea .    2.414651871851047
mr president , allow me to start with the UNK of kosovo .    3.2370788317781005
it is obvious since the nato bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing , not to promote peace and order but to drive a UNK even further into yugoslavia , to change the borders and to promote the new order .    2.3633934371424163
all the signs point towards a second round of attacks on yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the kla attacks on serbs in mitrovica , the attempt to annex three towns in southern serbia to kosovo , the promotion of the independence of kosovo , the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into kosovo via greece , despite the objections of the greek people and , at the same time , intense efforts by nato and the european union to UNK the legitimate government of yugoslavia .    2.6491207220372535
on the other hand , despite his declarations on humanity and peace , it is clear from what mr solana has told us that , according to the helsinki resolutions , we intend to set up a terrorist army , starting with 60 000 men , in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the UNK .    2.589114536118515
mr solana has confirmed our view that , in a UNK european union , nato will have the UNK hand .    4.16617683925867
that is why this job went to mr solana , the secretary - general of nato , who is also guilty of the crimes committed against yugoslavia ; the right man for the right job , against whom charges have been filed , calling for him to be tried as a war criminal .    2.1843885877286673
commissioner , mr solana , there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas .    3.3134604177982885
i wonder , and here i do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow members , about the direction in which we are going .    3.5343670133230916
i think that contrary to the great process of economic and monetary union , which was an integrated process within the community structures , today , unfortunately , the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure .    3.0799727709393596
my first question , mr solana and commissioner , is to establish whether , together , you have framed strategies that will , at least gradually , lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the community process .    3.2232587362583525
we have taken fifteen years to achieve economic and monetary union .    2.70474788321458
we can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy , but the process must be clear .    3.503710904819099
i also believe that we should not underestimate , and this is a question that i put to you , the UNK and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries .    3.8486571852806666
we know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the community .    2.4902220498294305
today , they would have everything to lose from the UNK of foreign policy , and i believe that they are working with that in mind .    3.7528821422359346
without this status , there will only be instability , murders , provocation by belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the european union should come to a decision on this matter .    3.15318959746004
finally , i should like to thank mr poettering because i believe that the belgian initiatives , as we say in common UNK , are getting a bit much .    3.105679107019891
i think many member states among the fourteen other member states would have many reasons not to cooperate in european union meetings on justice , for example .    2.6155331976495972
four years after the arrest of mr dutroux and his associates , we have still not had a trial , and we still do not know what is happening .    2.9682917415983154
as far as tourism is concerned , there will be many people in these fourteen member states who could consider UNK parents of young children from taking holidays in belgium , for example .    2.7328041712755238
so the time has come and i would ask mr solana and mr patten to tell mr michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may UNK on him , which is what i hope will happen .    2.717393941931777
mr president , first of all , i would like to warmly congratulate mr solana on this first day of march , for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on european security and defence policy .    2.5949789070220435
according to the documents , cooperation with the high representative was fruitful .    3.2215821595186163
you said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch . you have to admit , it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks .    2.913472188543177
but do you not regret the fact that you do not UNK over them yourself and are not their leading light ?    2.866941732556929
i - and i believe many with me in parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent .    2.824322216748685
over the past couple of months , high representative solana and commissioner patten have , during discussions , among other things , with members of the nato assembly , tried to separate the defence policies of the eu and nato .    2.6527203699019064
one gets the impression in fact that they both think that the petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the eu defence policy in due course .    2.4988376701255
the treaties also point in that direction , although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a european pillar .    2.3782205603793676
we would then have a voice in nato through this european pillar .    2.3089279009981345
actually , i hear less and less about this .    2.498380854796733
i am under the impression that the european union has UNK its ambitions down to the petersberg tasks , with mr patten taking responsibility for civil affairs , which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed , about which he has talked with enthusiasm , and rightly so , and mr solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment .    2.3208651703717753
it seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation , which would work very well .    2.692677212778067
but is there not more to it than that ?    2.5306212227629605
i cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy , nato ' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence .    3.031597221801483
the european pillar does not really function any more as such . europe is not venturing beyond the petersberg tasks .    2.2996029034241015
is this actually how we want things done ?    2.3654542798609683
moreover , whilst there may be talk of integrating the western european union into the european union , there is no longer any mention of article v , which is , of course , of direct concern to us . article v touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just petersberg .    2.929938823325906
will it be omitted ?    3.1632043188548638
at the same time , an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets .    2.7458913339188022
i think that this is to be welcomed , but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between petersberg tasks and wider , collective defence tasks .    2.494523789056541
i wonder how this will develop .    2.566985426676149
i would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long - term future .    2.433123769883598
is it necessary to give further attention to this during the igc or will the treaties inevitably set the ball rolling ?    2.4137262060577713
i am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy .    2.687920298978484
i do wonder , if turkey were to bring in a UNK , would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy ?    2.6950210971562125
the fabric of turkey ' s government contains a few haider - type personalities .    2.5817983891917025
that would seem odd to me .    2.5485445763314525
secondly , the baltic states are also knocking on our door .    2.3009310868062096
will they also take part in our defence policy ?    2.807762261990795
it is a very interesting position to be in , to say the least .    3.193548086492058
high representative , you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between amsterdam and helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since helsinki , such as the establishment of the three committees and , of course , the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50 - 60 000 - strong military force .    2.9184494487109207
however , this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on - going intergovernmental conference even further .    2.4393908618593785
i believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who , rightly , are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the intergovernmental conference .    3.0130366097420955
a word of warning to the latter : this policy needs substantial democratic UNK .    2.334211272018931
we are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy , and i would therefore ask you , in general terms , of course , whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues : the new , two - level commission - high representative structure ; a clear , practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management .    2.9046019063417785
at this stage , this could include , for example , collaboration between the commission and the political committee , the consolidation of community responsibility for non - military crisis management , the creation of a council of ministers for defence , coordination of the treaty on european union , the nato charter and the weu , the legal personality of the european union , reinforced cooperation in this area as well , parliamentary control and , lastly , financing .    3.0766052049959995
do you think that any of these issues could be included , at least in the agenda of the current conference ?    3.2546809803948453
mr solana , i am sitting quite close to you , close enough to see your face .    2.82180465229718
i think that you have aged , your face is quite UNK .    2.5891150376428547
it pains me to look at you and i despair on listening to you ; that applies both to what you say about UNK with little soldiers , as mrs maes just put it , and what you do not say .    2.615829757086442
you bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another UNK of ethnic cleansing in kosovo and yet you have stood up here , while blood is being UNK in kosovo , and you have not said a word about it .    2.459269368242787
you are spanish ; you are from a large country , mr solana .    2.7415705440148703
spain and franco were not one and the same .    2.6028946409220577
spain maintained its unity , it kept the basque country and UNK and UNK and it did well to do so , because no one identified spain with franco and no one played around with spain ' s unity in the name of a fascist dictator .    2.3863990274380127
today , you are identifying yugoslavia with milosevic and you are playing with UNK , with montenegro and with southern serbia . it is you who has created this mess .    2.57509287445264
which is why , unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees , all these plans on paper will lead to new blood - letting in the balkans .    2.3476748327205934
mr solana , the war in kosovo and the continuing crisis , have served to reveal a european public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the european union , throughout the world , should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the president of the united states of america and that the time has come to share the burden , which our american friends have constantly been demanding since europe became a world economic power .    2.7194964710628344
the first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men , which , as you have said , is likely to be deployed to perform peace - keeping and peace - building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long - term basis , if necessary .    2.70521423140423
for the information of our colleagues , i must say here that the corresponding UNK should be divided into three parts : one third to prepare the mission , one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation , following often difficult UNK for personnel and equipment .    2.191241114817565
this explains why the initial figures given in the press , setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men , is close to reality , which has certainly surprised the UNK .    2.4071338419912727
my first question , mr solana , will be simple and more direct , perhaps , than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me .    2.5867046721539975
you know the french UNK , ' nothing for nothing ' .    2.556020795865319
do you really think that the governments of the union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them , apparently at least , have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends .    3.0362253451906245
my second question is of a more technical nature , but it is important for the responsibilities of the atlantic alliance and the western european union to be transferred to the european union as UNK as possible .    3.488406606131295
you have told us , in this regard , that three committees are being set up , a political committee and a security committee , which started up today , and a military committee .    2.9142092087837406
you then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the atlantic alliance or associate members of the western european union but which are not members of the european union .    3.259544729826296
in the operation of the temporary institutions , whose establishment has just been decided , can you tell us , mr solana , what status you intend to confer on the members of the alliance and on the associate states of the weu which , i repeat , are not yet members of the european union ?    3.138993311143602
could they , for example , have a place , at least as observers , in the different political and security committees or in the military committee ?    3.566624410336019
you know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and i should like to say that i understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion .    3.164683506951811
mr president , secretary - general , as you can tell , the members of this house have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the informal meeting of defence ministers in sintra and its significance in the european integration process in terms of security and defence .    3.2096839105151282
thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with mr gil - robles .    2.058868443232051
however , in terms of foreign policy , i am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements , as some members have said this afternoon , without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against .    3.030840680601151
i will give you an example .    2.7057738646518357
during the recent trip by the president of the european parliament to the middle east , which you mentioned , the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the european union in the on - going peace process in the region .    3.2168194644852837
do you believe that representatives of community institutions and member state governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who , like us , hope to mediate between two opposing parties ?    2.236470614733065
this house is rather doubtful about this and i am not sure whether you share this doubt .    2.860532473685069
in this respect , as you will know , the european parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the community . this is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the member states but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination .    2.9910718916747823
could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative , without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the foreign affairs committee ?    2.8467088899994692
mr solana , it has been said many times in this house that prevention is better than cure .    3.4757600482750335
of course it is , but there is no reason why europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful .    2.9218341364172167
in any case , it is prevention that i would like to discuss today .    3.603174695352361
war is threatening to break out again in the gulf .    2.840377086642899
as you know , the iraqi government has refused to abide by united nations resolution 1284 , and this is likely to lead , within the next six or seven weeks , to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .    2.4424416783470093
if this happens , the united states ' government and the british government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention .    3.1894818639335765
a visit to iraq and meetings with the iraqi leaders and leading figures , particularly mr UNK UNK , convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the iraqi government to cooperate in enforcing resolution 1284 .    2.42188908690209
however , the responsible authorities of the western countries need to make it clear that , once the mission of the united nations committee has been successfully completed , the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed .    2.772140234162517
i would like to know what you and europe are doing , mr solana , or what you intend to do in the near future , to stave off this threat of war .    2.6893637335496265
today , we have the chance to prevent it ; tomorrow it may be too late .    2.9077401759485504
i would also like to know whether , in this context , it would not be possible to do something to induce the iraqi government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the UNK missing UNK , or to set them free if this is within their power .    2.946386612025299
as we sit here , hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous UNK from the floods in mozambique .    2.615171787682509
this has not just happened .    2.784034964042069
the flooding has been going for weeks , and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need .    2.5382865508589614
the level of practical assistance from the community and from the member states has been pathetic .    3.7452401404109468
for a long time , many of us have sounded a warning that the european union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision - making structures , when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments , particularly for humanitarian intervention .    2.5917354040388028
i acknowledge mr patten ' s efforts in this direction , but what a pity that the governments of the member states had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of nato .    2.325859419528934
of course , there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance , and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many european countries .    2.6893624549751105
these are of long standing , but are being addressed already within nato .    2.4616555972965797
after all , the eu member states are either full members of nato or sit around the euro atlantic partnership council table .    2.5268678433082354
nato is largely european .    2.8553441819647998
finally , mr solana , i would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the council secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe .    2.4974451993634146
mr president , high representative , commissioner , with regard to the war in chechnya , we have all noted the particularly UNK and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the european union in particular .    3.503985327351104
now , what has happened and what is still happening in chechnya is similar to genocide .    2.8022724789105116
how else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants , the UNK and inordinate bombing of towns , villages and districts where , in amongst the whole of the civilian population , there are perhaps a handful of chechen fighters ?    2.55850992069236
how should we describe the sinister filtration camps , which are comparable to concentration camps , in which the population is suffering the most dreadful UNK and from which able - UNK men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive ?    2.241274841609708
how can we describe the UNK , the looting , the deliberate UNK , the UNK , which are called " cleansing " , that recall the worst episodes of the middle ages in europe ?    3.111253081950938
and what can we say about the UNK UNK that is UNK down on russian and international journalists and with the UNK of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres ?    2.8651627896390153
if that is realpolitik , if we really do not have any means , mr solana , as high representative of the cfsp , and commissioner , i put this question to you both , let us at least use the means that we do have , namely , the aid programmes to russia .    3.0319906847745677
the war in chechnya proves , if proof were necessary , that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers .    2.784778770189523
let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the russian federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war , to the exclusion of any other objective .    2.7014079056720806
mr high representative , you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at helsinki .    3.130518810653666
some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a UNK european security organisation to defend peace in the world .    2.990183572327071
of course we recognise the role of the security council , as the helsinki resolutions clearly state , in maintaining international peace and security .    2.997536395952428
however , we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the security council , as referred to at helsinki , was contested recently .    3.0190578442781346
the point is : does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism , which will cover the entire spectrum of petersberg decisions ?    2.311835938371783
what about the infrastructures ?    3.0593431284279387
is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy ?    2.8343625159961636
secondly , what will happen to the european defence industry which , after all , comes under the more general activities relating to this system ?    3.0421173733447664
will current programmes continue to be implemented ?    3.5309188670201554
finally , if the treaty needs to be amended , how do you think this amendment will be implemented , following the report to be submitted in feira ? how will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting ?    3.089333910249579
has any thought been given to the matter ?    3.3708128877684933
has it been discussed ?    2.8915585779153457
and to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient ?    2.3626050413288735
mr president , i seem to recall from my study of european history , that the UNK convention of sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably UNK rather than shortened the UNK wars and nearly cost the UNK of UNK his job .    2.3584040845295644
i hope this is not an omen for this sintra agreement .    2.894537096335424
that said , i would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far .    3.6507530549683818
but it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters , and the real test of the european defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity , rather than nicely formulated institutions .    3.122907998007297
and , to that end , i am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation , or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity , particularly given the american statements that they are not giving intelligence to europeans until they can deal with security .    2.8343994223386337
we have all heard some of the tales emanating from the council of ministers building in brussels .    2.895208699022973
to what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure , because some member states spend considerably more than others .    2.550723859468986
and indeed , some member states are not geared for mobility .    3.007197915645447
they are very UNK in their military forces , and unsuitable for this sort of warfare .    2.5641498190368215
can i perhaps also turn to mr patten as well and ask , in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing , to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long - term conflict - causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream eu policies , particularly in development , because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right .    2.859128973410075
and finally , can i also endorse mrs schroedter ' s comments that we do need to have a parliamentary dimension in this defence development .    2.872106068022137
we cannot leave it simply to governments .    2.4591875845696864
i strongly support the decisions taken at sintra .    2.7999746494886617
they constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective european security and defence policy .    2.402685202859787
the creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving eu policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction .    2.4464604307962623
the recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both UNK and peacekeeping is also appropriate .    2.2891632000372852
however , while all these developments are indeed welcome , i would like to address a matter which i have raised in this house on previous occasions .    3.2216974541069643
i am anxious to know how effective the eu ' s policy planning and early warning unit has been .    2.5222598498240147
while commissioner patten ' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in mozambique will be opportune , i would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information .    2.371732992631137
would the high representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit , which has been strongly supported by the committee of which i and mr titley are members , assisted in providing early information , analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves ?    2.988126769434165
i would also like to support mr titley ' s comments on an effective role for the parliament in this whole area .    2.3677808844062898
if we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy , then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises , particularly humanitarian ones , are essential prerequisites .    2.3308290886478082
when mr solana last spoke to this parliament i was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention ; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention , but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way .    2.5093233017178065
we have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year , but we currently have crises in europe and on the borders of europe and elsewhere which this union is failing UNK to deal with .    2.870154970383775
what we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations .    2.9695242709264433
we have not heard any information from mr solana about what UNK is going to be used in relation to russia and chechnya .    2.892931533579252
we have not heard anything from mr solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the european union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in chechnya .    2.383034174068318
we have large gaps in what we are arguing for , in principle , in relation to human rights .    3.19174678577356
we UNK the capacity to intervene in relation to kosovo , and we are now making a complete mess of kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention .    2.5941340552287206
so , i would ask mr solana to explain to this house the position of the european union in relation to chechnya .    3.9598463270018223
what are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end ?    2.540932270878279
we have UNK we can use with russia if we choose to use them , but we are choosing not to use them .    2.7160862223389595
mr president , high representative , commissioner , i have two questions for you , mr solana . how , with credibility , are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the member states are not prepared to comply with common commitments ?    3.102068085662468
meetings are all very well , but it is the result that counts .    4.107737121487465
i also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper .    2.507526259912462
if we look around , the reality is that the cfsp is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk . take , for example , germany ' s defence savings .    2.5081500085986086
these are not only of concern to the defence minister , mr scharping . instead , they also affect the whole of europe .    3.107060708204868
in my own country , sweden , the objective , and the commitment towards playing our part , is to supply 2 500 men for eu operations .    2.730607125289148
in the present situation , the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men , due to reduced defence spending .    2.458210157318502
if we translate this number into figures for the eu countries as a whole , which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place , we shall not have 60 000 men but , at best , 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003 .    2.9524488585719397
my second question concerns the following matter . some weeks ago , you were evidently UNK in the german - speaking media , whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters .    2.1845562159553684
i should like , however , to know the background to this , namely whether , as high representative , you have been UNK at all with the idea of giving austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and , if so , on whose mandate and with how much leeway .    2.7625480316414706
i am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the high representative .    3.3825002929243317
i will not detain the parliament for long but perhaps i could make one or two points and begin , which is sometimes rather dangerous in any parliament , by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality .    2.4925987663682063
mrs pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail i think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow .    2.3607418815695382
i would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject .    2.3180457058293498
i spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the nato parliamentary assembly and members of this parliament .    2.4086973816768373
many of you were there on that occasion and i think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a UNK among many of the nato parliamentary delegates when we spoke about europe ' s ambitions in the area of cfsp .    3.1650326599342136
this was particularly true with some of the american delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well .    2.861688215997707
as i said in my remarks , i felt when i was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to UNK or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the high representative ' s remarks today were extremely encouraging .    2.8394176661676536
   3.702094057753363
we have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time , but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves , for example , facing up to difficult questions about resources .    2.7248519949101526
many people will argue that of course all that is required in europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but i suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the member states about whether that really is enough , about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own union .    3.2761357053095397
i would just like to say a word about the non - military aspects of our security policy , of conflict prevention and crisis management .    2.655207466451767
rightly , the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non - military side either and mozambique reminds us of the importance of UNK that .    2.900031532531328
we will be bringing forward to the council before lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required , not in months or years , but in days or weeks .    2.9652680487630283
we are establishing a commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative ' s policy unit .    2.26526479232718
additionally , and this is for me the most important area of all , an area where we are breaking new ground , we will , soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility , be bringing forward proposals as well on non - military headline goals .    3.025586379381796
it is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner .    2.3362933767004863
i grew up as a kid hoping i would be allowed to stay up on saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community UNK called UNK of UNK green .    2.7786185322840513
i have just been writing a report before i came to this job , and writing a very good report , just to respond to my honourable friend , on policing in part of my own country .    2.43522861515739
i remember talking about community policing to some american police experts and saying ' what in your view is the ideal community police officer ' and the reply was ' a black grandmother ' .    1.948234237319394
we have armed forces , we have all got experience of training community police officers .    2.7103936794778676
what is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing .    2.3943259048722405
we need somebody who has the ability to UNK crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well .    2.265609178785101
that is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the european union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences .    4.35169946972116
so again , rhetoric and reality .    2.526846363256471
now mr titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate .    2.309256504398353
one thing i would advise him to do is to listen to radio 4 at the end of march to the first UNK lecture where he will hear the commissioner for external relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject .    2.4766273798093374
but perhaps i could just say one or two things this afternoon .    2.6200292238078124
i think there is an UNK cord between neglecting human rights , between neglecting UNK corpus , between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance , between tyranny and between environmental degradation .    2.3362809053922198
all those things come together .    2.665148747380118
we talk about the complexities of our eco - system but there is an eco - system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the balkans as well .    2.556387442591598
so , in the coming months , we will be producing communications from the commission , for example , which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises .    4.045519792731953
we will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this parliament feels passionately about , that is , how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as UNK and UNK as possible without UNK the integrity of the institutions which do it .    2.7691147601654222
we will be producing a communication on anti - personnel landmines , actually the use of UNK equipment .    2.6400140460839343
the work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in mozambique .    3.265438614840564
they have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the UNK , they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools .    2.694423918834396
what does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days , moving those anti - personnel mines around ?    2.468410046034323
we are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise .    2.6292682326252343
what we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that UNK with our policies elsewhere .    3.1861532115535978
we have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti - personnel landmines in ukraine , in moldova , the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks , the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks , the political consequences of dealing with those stocks .    2.449550873899758
so the point i want to make is that all these things are intimately related .    3.0195730291764438
we have all the instruments , we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the high representative and i face in the next four or five years .    3.3842469146464396
now , i hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric .    3.014628034326618
we all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and i will tell you three of them - bosnia , albania , kosovo .    2.934188812695689
   3.702094057753363
those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics , quite a few american politicians , quite a few UNK and UNK who say ' how can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep ? ' .    2.469909216012094
so the big test for us is going to be in the balkans . i hope that all those heads of government , all those prominent politicians in our member states who promised the earth in the balkans , who promised marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the balkans .    2.6938536789143894
i would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the european council , the general affairs council and ecofin .    3.233071350469836
all on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver .    3.0383200619365587
in the last few months in this job i have heard promises that we will do more in latin america , i have heard promises that if there is a middle east peace settlement , we will be there to pay for it .    3.1306108066498113
i have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern UNK .    2.7178179544049375
i have heard promises that we will secure democracy in indonesia by giving more assistance to indonesia    2.3639626634953967
where is the beef ?    2.6340463364770965
and that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy .    3.492219791666204
one reason why i am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that i do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality , the response is ' UNK but we know you are not running things efficiently , we know that you have not spent all your commitments , we know there is some money in your back UNK ' .    2.5785293743308273
i want us to be in a position in which we can say : ' it is not like that any more . we are running things as efficiently and competently as we can ' .    3.338491124372493
so , member states , we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between council conclusions , between UNK of UNK and what we can actually deliver on the ground and i think that if we can achieve that the job of the high representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better .    3.417232981607712
thank you very much , commissioner patten .    2.1334526225371873
i would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your british sense of UNK in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue , for it makes things a little more interesting .    2.6939229605811845
women in the decision - making process    3.4638379299062017
the next item is the declarations by the council and the commission on women in the decision - making process .    2.5846603793114027
mr president , two centuries ago , during the french revolution , a very famous woman , UNK de UNK , was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women .    2.2287859030552775
two centuries later , we have achieved a great deal in europe .    3.7874567104274406
the last century was marked by three periods .    2.415638183147474
the first period was a period of institutional change , change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional UNK in all the member states as a result of the fight by the women ' s movement , as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women .    2.946918209550059
this was followed by a second period , in which the worth of female models was recognised .    2.5950664325032693
there were women everywhere .    2.732204418596334
prime ministers , members of parliament , ministers , in the professional arena , doctors , lawyers , UNK , UNK .    3.5370708182530457
we are now in a third period : in this third period , the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed .    2.738415000557091
the composition , or rather the change in composition , will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes .    2.577422833573827
ladies and gentlemen , the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events : the first was the election of the president of finland , mrs UNK .    2.784981062706339
for the first time in finland , the women candidates UNK the men .    2.6264054067630505
and a woman was elected .    2.6724417369174467
the second event took place in france , which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in april 1999 at the ' women and men in power ' conference , at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio .    2.5494535901233752
we must congratulate prime minister jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner .    2.0326282610068183
a great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the member states .    3.1025867877752638
but the figures tell the true story .    2.4856921043255884
and the figures still give europe cause for concern .    2.3472920216725535
24 % of members of government are women and there are an average of 22 % in parliament , although this UNK from 6 % in some member states to as many as 40 % in others .    2.997366590661061
the number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small .    2.395877857619291
even in countries such as germany and belgium , which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes , the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18 % .    2.758005627933629
what we need , therefore , is to promote specific policies .    3.6709246740343984
we need a policy mix which includes long - term political commitments , as in sweden and finland ; they now have governments in which women account for 56 % and 44 % of members respectively .    2.272121258106936
we need organisation and statistical monitoring .    2.442406978683293
we need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture , UNK and specific problems of each area .    2.417210519308385
and , of course , these policies need a budget , they need to be given financial teeth .    3.0056476567908903
increasing the number of women or , as the french prime minister put it , increasing the influence of women in the decision - making centres , is the best way of renewing the policy , of UNK the approach to the question , of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience : the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up .    2.821302350132241
the recent initiative by the finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision - making centres is extremely important .    2.3856140768523884
these indicators include national parliaments , regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every member state .    2.4371622752948476
i think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets , compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool .    2.526190827035056
the programme which i shall present for the fifth women ' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring .    2.727157132900584
although legislative measures and institutional intervention by member states have been effective as far as the decision - making centres of the parties in power is concerned , the same cannot be said for the private sector .    3.0417925093600244
my contacts with large european and multinational companies in europe have brought tragic results to light .    2.2397904375674456
there are companies at european level which employ thousands of workers , sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2 % of the directors and managers are women .    2.6739547870182903
nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision - making centres .    2.681509474688391
here too , specific efforts will be made of course ; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature , but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices ; in all cases , my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results .    2.40717269834158
as you know , europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within .    2.656002095500963
a decision has already been taken on quotas of 40 % for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes .    2.388150872520422
it was approved by the house in may 1999 , when the need for women in research and technology was stressed .    3.6255257400005996
we in the commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the commissioners are working together , as can be seen from the reform of the commission , to achieve 40 % representation of women on all the committees of the european commission .    3.326585314857318
ladies and gentlemen , there are often objections , UNK - progressive objections , as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power .    2.542209571381007
no one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say .    2.4980567447020916
and at the level of the european union , the question of whether the 15 member states need to be represented on every committee will never be asked .    3.740950537210574
why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population .    2.4267196489080325
i should like to be absolutely categorical .    2.9142019027117065
there should be no reservation , no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power .    2.0078272578245695
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
women make up half the population , half the strength of the planet .    2.6712646501070703
excluding women from the centres of power means , first , democratic failure and , secondly , under - exploitation of human resources .    2.47498878964612
we face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles .    2.355594004423498
i am optimistic that we shall succeed .    3.0647910584418003
the bet before us is a bet with time .    2.4019294391816697
future generations of women must not be sidelined .    3.0354010631172437
if need be , we must use all possible means to force the situation .    3.0343771896557583
( applause )    2.1767590376390373
mr president , firstly i must thank mrs UNK UNK for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject .    2.7201402692941015
i must also thank the commissioner for being here and for her words .    2.949923501536702
the various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under - represented in the decision - making process , in both the political and the economic and social spheres .    2.76711882140908
nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life , in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved .    3.306240721348849
the equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work . this involves both equality in accessing work , which implies equality in training , and equal pay for the same work , so often defended and yet far from being achieved .    2.2994804971132425
we are convinced that the participation of women in the decision - making process will be beneficial to society as a whole .    2.67997294141829
women always have a different viewpoint from men . this serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us , who are dedicated to active politics , undertake to solve .    2.334007936653273
the difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making .    2.632550188668445
in some countries of the european union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women .    2.6601634867162267
however , this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men .    2.3199935529797635
women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent .    2.6339442396340957
there must also be a clear and real will to allow more women , who are ready and able , to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision - making process .    2.696307112434238
there is no clear agreement within the ppe - de group in support of the compulsory quota system .    2.642239181251363
some members have even come out against this .    2.6596735115799284
personally , i would not want to feel like a quota , to think that i was in a particular job because i was a woman .    3.3008108509107634
this is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference .    2.98698134750745
mr president , i should also like to thank the president - in - office of the council and the commissioner for good speeches on their part which i think provide hope for real optimism , especially given the will and commitment UNK by both women .    2.3705209555192135
i think it was an excellent example the commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the european union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women .    2.7050820579714077
it could hardly have been made more abundantly clear , what we are concerned with here .    3.1306707653904917
i do hope that the commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the commission - but then , of course , she is young and full of energy .    2.966677830453456
i am convinced that it will be hard work , when all is said and done .    2.616845094049588
if the commissioner asks for support from parliament , she can in any case count upon the support of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party .    2.374742384376853
we have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the commissioner can implement her views on equality .    2.777298952482701
i would say to the portuguese minister that i completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power .    2.7334648625106692
that is absolutely crucial .    3.012581227626654
it should also be remembered , however , that no one voluntarily UNK power , and that applies to both men and women .    2.9492674926840863
men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them , but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power , and i am thinking here , in particular , of positions of power in relation to children .    3.369889650702747
moreover , i would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today .    3.295700797607628
inevitably , we should like , for the same reasons of power politics , to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves .    3.748902322876995
what i want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides ' surrendering power .    3.444173095543635
the commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly - based political mix , and she specifically mentioned finland and sweden .    2.360826149657132
and i say that , of course , because i come from denmark .    4.6651783091325925
in fact , 45 % of the danish government is made up of women , and that is , in reality , a touch more than in finland .    3.530185921468918
we still do not have a female president but , on the other hand , we have a UNK , and that must no doubt , in certain contexts , amount to the same thing .    3.5113396252432634
i should like to UNK some of the points the commissioner mentioned , notably the question of financial resources .    3.3133466831145277
it is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term .    2.9830042450933636
in the short term , we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and , of course , also properly educated .    2.8254373612969816
the issue is therefore one of appropriate structures .    2.5893847174912636
one might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing , and i am therefore very happy that the portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the lisbon summit , which is , of course , to be partly concerned with it developments .    2.8748651897010964
i think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women , specifically because it is characterised by flat , rather than hierarchical , structures .    2.4778887693981577
in denmark , we have , in any case , seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up .    3.521467906108909
there are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which i should just like to mention here finally .    3.156345542325589
the first is the issue of the media ' s influence .    2.778468184912126
i think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish .    2.803011779203695
do we have a special problem in this regard ?    4.354959886488103
i have to say that i do not know the precise answer to that question .    2.888066168962259
i have a suspicion that this is the case , but i am not certain .    4.84565106894367
the second point is the enlargement of the union .    2.6466724347224124
i think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well , specifically that the new member states should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned .    3.353154889185479
i would also like to thank the minister and the commissioner for their statements and i agree with the commissioner ' s statement ; it is time that fine words were translated into action .    2.932876499458278
we all know to what extent women are under - represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves .    2.740789643961973
i agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems .    2.861792535133488
it is systematic monitoring which will reveal this .    2.300197658886615
mainstreaming is a long - term commitment and process .    3.0219689838294457
in the meantime , we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures .    2.987798152302728
we can learn from the successes mentioned , not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected , but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system .    2.551107000789459
i am pleased to say that in wales , which i represent , 40 % of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but , on the other hand , we have only 4 women mps from wales in the house of commons which is only 10 % of the total ; so statements of principle , of support in principle , are not enough because they have not worked .    2.9330747308230265
if we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen .    3.6037909110555515
mr president , at the second international conference of socialist women held in copenhagen in 1910 , it was decided that the main demand of the time , that of a woman ' s right to vote , should be linked to the women ' s question as a whole and that ( as also stated in the relevant resolution ) women ' s day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for .    2.7136462827813355
it is also worth noting that international women ' s day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years .    2.2997718913701846
in 1910 , a woman ' s right to vote was on the agenda .    2.4955261196043512
today , we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision - making process .    2.860092956386538
women are no homogenous collective .    2.6275547647612285
women belong to different social classes .    2.5400722501275697
irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class , race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work , it is nonetheless a fact that , in all areas of society , the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men ( albeit with a few individual exceptions , it is perhaps best to add ) .    2.8998063295758145
in my own country , sweden , a number of political parties have , in recent years , voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run .    2.329913487840838
this has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which , in turn , has provided opportunities for further research .    2.7294249932729846
what happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making ?    2.234580211791993
what has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes , so too of course do the types of decisions made .    2.630625453395602
when the talk turns to quota allocation by gender , the word " qualifications " also crops up .    2.078156376497693
what is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined .    2.6317193602504974
it often looks as if men today , as in the past , always have the least defined qualifications .    3.0171445079859387
being a man therefore seems , in itself , to be synonymous with maximum competence .    2.8417058941085243
this way of seeing things i consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today ' s decision makers .    2.8205358495105224
earlier this year , we requested , here in this chamber , that 8 march be made into an international holiday .    2.75269190829207
in anticipation of this request being met , i now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the " women ' s world UNK " which are to begin this spring on international women ' s day .    2.426998428595178
this is a world - wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world .    2.210082242986458
finally , i want to say , as commissioner patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close , that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother .    2.8680375437018175
mr president , the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to UNK each other in terms of political correctness .    3.0696073217135234
undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics .    2.728900380059952
in france , 95 % of elected representatives are town UNK .    2.5415684012416633
the vast majority of them are not members of any party .    2.7292829295433707
in order to be elected as a local UNK , you just have to want to be elected .    2.7950881073171576
but access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local UNK .    2.0885778623349904
our group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the european union .    2.826492944926086
that is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination , whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities .    3.0899200028410863
the policy of minorities , while neglecting the deep - seated unity of the human family , to establish superficial divisions , is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system .    2.5786438660980893
on the one hand , if we establish quotas for women , why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group , quotas of catholics , of workers , of those who wear UNK .    2.4188687042667194
the establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more UNK than establishing quotas of women .    2.8791842722556655
with such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative UNK .    2.7724298451137033
it would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation .    2.780034452439937
the policy of quotas can only increase the UNK of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs .    2.6583673219157435
on the other hand , such a policy shows a deep contempt for women .    2.36852420154186
a woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised .    2.353245564330612
ladies , have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the UNK of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota ?    2.583109832773056
women deserve more than a quota .    3.0846256598147783
minister , commissioner , everything you have just said has been very well expressed , even if a few male colleagues , if there are still any in the chamber , perhaps UNK their teeth .    3.0812241344317104
but the statistics prove it : the positive action , even the quotas , - if they are not applied blindly , without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision - making process .    2.454394549160525
that is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas , as a transitional measure , contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women , particularly in political life .    2.900736436133377
i should like to take this opportunity to remind the commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas .    2.396601196710304
first of all it concerns our report , which was adopted last year on the occasion of international women ' s day in strasbourg , which requests the commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women .    3.2091861128971675
according to the treaty of amsterdam , there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right , and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically .    2.7090310687653685
things being what they are , nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society , requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures , including positive action .    2.50319057221013
therefore , commissioner , you can go ahead .    3.60259302203376
you do not need to wait for a new amendment to the treaty .    3.7603875761283714
may i just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and UNK with regard to the equal treatment of self - employed people , including assistant spouses .    2.830755948204657
no action has been taken on our report which unanimously proposed a european framework status for assistant spouses .    2.385225407599841
here again , commissioner , the ball is in your court .    3.106983930644266
do not take too long to send it back .    2.6732622971359046
i would like to thank the minister and the commissioner for their speeches and for UNK themselves before the european parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today .    2.8794039427445846
the presence of women in decision - making bodies , in particular , is a question of democracy .    4.058425852297758
if we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision - making bodies , it is clear that we are still far from true democracy .    3.3618732102465536
however , it is also a question of political agendas .    3.4656389996616417
in addition to making up the majority of the population , women are also the most dynamic element in society : it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in europe in recent years ; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men , and in many of our regions , they are the main feature of the innovation , training , performance and flexibility development model .    2.704896874017295
out of a sample of women who work in and around milan , where i live , 90 % said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day .    2.6389990034438027
women work an average of 60 hours a week , which is 20 hours longer than men .    2.603265710648198
the price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time .    2.175765955302943
if this is true , and it is , any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point .    3.1041891263589636
laws , programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well - constructed , coordinated and UNK , in order to encourage the formation of new cultural , economic , social , institutional and political ruling classes whose UNK is characterised by the involvement of women .    2.6930695528900803
much has been achieved on many issues in europe , but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation .    3.5894435579423227
i agree with the commissioner that it is time for the european political sphere - the entire european political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing , and for decisive action to be taken in this matter .    3.037983832838552
mr president , before i came here for today ' s sitting , i was watching finnish television .    2.7348181516556807
in finland , an honorary company of the finnish army was UNK the new president of the republic , with the words " good morning , madam president . "    2.970414935427542
you perhaps know that , in finland , the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader , but she is also commander - in - chief of the armed forces , so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion .    2.667808986134323
during the finnish presidential term , a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision - making process , and , on the basis of this report , i hope that the commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making .    3.424779271227637
i urge you all , women of the right , to listen to mrs lulling , because she told us why quotas were needed and , if any of us has sufficient experience of political life , it is she .    2.7662168153709894
finally , i would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference .    3.0983349962498092
i appeal to you , ladies and gentlemen , not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4 , to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the intergovernmental conference .    2.7398099437259456
mr president , madam president - in - office of the council , commissioner , despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination , the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution . this means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision - making process .    2.8023532368047976
we know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve , both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility .    2.3617752282382063
it is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the council , the commission and each member state strictly to respect the commitments they have made , particularly at the beijing conference .    3.266660137807265
madam president - in - office of the council , commissioner , i am a right - wing member of parliament but i have the same battles as my colleagues in supporting and assisting fellow citizens in my country to gain power and access to decision - making posts , which should be feasible not only in the political arena but clearly also in all sectors of society .    2.9177012437331915
quite simply , i would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and i am particularly against the system of quotas , because i believe it is especially UNK of women and i come from a country where UNK has just been achieved .    3.7428854848347255
it is quite logical , it is consistent !    3.390079819156164
it should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50 % , if not more , of those within decision - making bodies and , inter alia , in the political arena .    2.783377765363078
so , there should be no positive discrimination to include women .    2.625731252816607
woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense .    2.4340504252445796
when i see that we are asking for training for women in politics , i want to say - no , definitely not .    3.557630359707178
let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training ?    1.8892311678925695
that simply amounts to UNK their UNK .    2.9697161834997754
but i do know that we have never felt inferior to men , particularly in politics .    3.3011898771916193
so i believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow UNK to achieve decision - making power , to gain responsible posts in the political arena , but i believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think .    2.9087129214855185
we shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women ' s participation in the political decision - making process .    2.6638195885196976
mr president , minister , commissioner , " women are half of heaven " , a successful man once said .    2.4522539088627244
but when it comes to important decisions and priorities , there is a lack of women ' s voices .    3.4192130624675023
women , who constitute more than half of the population , are heavily under - represented within political , economic and social fields .    2.8907944593257398
that is unacceptable in a democracy .    2.7999032220422517
where equality is concerned , the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making .    2.728943441315599
if we are to achieve a balance , a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required .    2.8382787615128167
an important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women ' s full participation in power structures and decision making .    2.6670562509579225
i am therefore delighted that the commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind .    2.932532961930379
i propose that the eu ' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the UNK - out achievements of the three most successful member states within each area , with the member states each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated .    3.335925660411818
women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape , sexual offences , domestic violence and the trade in women , but they are under - represented on the legal and legislative bodies which UNK upon these crimes .    2.3966905855137814
the latter are consequently accorded low priority , and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted .    2.8016024384981555
women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under - represented in peace - keeping efforts , conflict resolution and reconstruction work .    2.237021487153728
in the resolution , we therefore urge the member states to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace - keeping .    3.5187257060831176
the call for women ' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy ; it is also essential if women ' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full .    2.9224063952205297
not to use women ' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste .    2.8654066618245135
women should not only be " half of heaven " but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet .    2.664465783599431
mr president , i would like to congratulate the president - in - office of the council and commissioner diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today .    2.3123208300280766
we have high hopes for what you will achieve .    2.3923837315366843
we are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to UNK decision - making positions .    2.77871256222365
we want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large , we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women , and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today .    2.6661485105936342
furthermore , we want values that women consider important , such as peace , fraternity , equality , justice , security and environmental protection , to be the guiding spirit for life in the european union and , if possible , throughout the world .    3.247196392480631
in order to achieve this , women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has , until now , been essentially UNK with masculine values .    2.7797881362034818
we know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for .    2.2918506135438985
let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory : not over men , not over anyone , but the victory of equality between men and women .    2.3762593087373496
we therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities , and the great challenge confronting all europeans now , and particularly women , concerns the new economy and the new information technologies .    2.8430545655725465
the lisbon summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women .    2.903055566723001
the rate of employment in europe , which is much lower than in the united states and japan , must be increased .    4.09658860337446
we must therefore have many more women in work , and working in the new jobs in which the eu has a UNK .    3.66050893940922
i would therefore like to ask the council and the commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming lisbon summit to ensure that the new economy and the new europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women .    3.166086441377062
mr president , commissioner , the reason why i was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the member states where the political representation of women is a success , such as , for example , in finland , france and sweden , and equally , you had the courage to list the member states where things in this respect are not going so well , such as , for example , my own country and greece too , which you forgot to mention .    2.836991283113258
moreover , i have heard that for the next elections , it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in greece .    2.961234208319752
i think this is a very sad state of affairs .    2.971307906567123
i appreciate your courage because i think that it is high time that we in the european institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda .    3.1148423751813668
this is why i think it is important that this parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution .    3.2475270563536935
i myself , commissioner , am a product of quotas . i do not believe that any of the meps will be able to prove that i am any less competent as a result .    3.54495853202861
it appears that the meritocracy in a number of our european countries is still so biased in favour of UNK that women simply do not stand a chance .    2.7361809055104276
it is true that a number of countries in the european union have already introduced quotas , and you yourself made reference to belgium , commissioner , where it has not really taken off .    3.4870780355258923
hardly surprising , would you not agree , mrs avilés perea , not because we failed to find the necessary candidates , but because recent scientific research , instigated by the commission , has shown that quotas are , in fact , only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats .    2.707841957478572
this is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas .    2.7786377032479956
indeed , minister , we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract .    2.7160563218147105
but we should draw the necessary conclusions from this .    2.4496972140157967
the electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one - for - one system , as is being applied in sweden on a voluntary basis .    2.414373553717281
i would suggest the following : where possible , apply it on a voluntary basis , where there is reluctance , impose it .    2.438858831981439
i hope that in the fifth action programme , minister and commissioner , benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through , for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this .    2.706996966963254
mr president , i too should like to congratulate the commissioner and the president - in - office of the council for their solid recommendations and , above all , for their proposals .    2.6231549139817463
because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women ' s rights , i thought i might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual , francis UNK , to today ' s debate .    2.6265607641707267
in an article entitled " if women ruled the world " , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics , the world would certainly not be so UNK to violence .    2.1818209482338453
UNK , the UNK of wisdom and war , may have been a female model in ancient greece , but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace .    2.714203371031003
there are , therefore , serious grounds , over and above justice between the sexes , for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and UNK between men and women .    2.277417089594839
women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue , reconciliation , an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means .    2.100235273365321
these female virtues can offer an alternative to today ' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone .    2.339771928532409
that is why the intergovernmental conference must introduce into the treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the european union and in all democratic institutions and political decision - making centres throughout the community .    3.21217118700935
mr president , why do women need their rightful share in political decision making ?    2.176687485462298
we all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary .    3.970779613718331
it is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and , as such , a condition for political legitimacy .    2.6384964259112946
but if we look into how to achieve this , the opinions are greatly divided .    2.765503013756386
is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment , much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties ?    2.5195454742420433
or should we even consider a system in which 50 % of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies ?    2.5096959635460743
this discussion , which is being held in some parts of europe and here too under the french banner of UNK , touches the very core of democracy , and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman .    3.222834944427727
in my opinion , the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level .    2.1123638606178248
i am a great UNK of voluntary quotas on electoral lists , without which , in fact , i would not be here today .    3.349955301246427
like mrs van lancker , i am a product of such a measure .    3.511157281090925
in my opinion , though , the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties , at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself .    2.675620364619589
in other words , the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid .    2.3940391994817984
we would , in this way , violate democracy .    3.565453356367449
mr president , today ' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision - making bodies and changes to the decision - making system in europe .    2.901462744658304
we have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors , education , work , culture .    2.7273392067192366
the problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision - making centres .    3.9714604901106902
the debate is a deeply political one .    2.3154095400313466
there are two approaches .    2.7878625571426707
the first is a policy of persuasion .    2.9871136145828228
gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved .    2.402757028732943
three comments : the first is based on the fact that women are able . i can , therefore all women can .    3.4440720743461934
how do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded ?    2.9624426619290554
we are able but the rest of the female population is not ?    2.6303565835454354
here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics . because women have to deal with different realities .    2.5174142932847263
because they have fewer opportunities .    2.75637423030644
because they have a different level of education .    2.9151331574395196
because they have to face social obstacles . because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest .    2.846578536678459
the second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders .    3.470964078367429
not necessary !    3.126516867641895
they have all been persuaded !    2.620517345036146
there is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women .    2.7200788228043056
there is not one party , from the far left to the far right , which does not stress the need for women to take part .    3.135977484561514
on paper !    3.22395065499868
thirdly , we must expect things to change gradually .    2.7608476091726133
the women ' s conference in beijing brought an important point to light .    2.799309089247205
with the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level , it will take 2 , 300 years to achieve a balance between men and women .    2.730041714047592
as far as europe is concerned , as far as the european parliament is concerned , where there is a quota for the involvement of women , it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation .    3.8943210081474278
the second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women .    2.2123313937909552
quotas alone are not enough .    2.7128329414882764
if only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history .    2.1147722096720845
on this we are clear .    2.988230652443884
quotas are one of the ways , one of the policies needed to bring about change .    3.8485608239868063
finally , on the question of whether , as the product of quotas , we can be proud , i would reply categorically that i would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that i had managed to impose quotas on greece , where the level of representation of women is 5 % .    3.5557052863650274
thank you , mrs diamantopoulou .    2.308029410005412
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .    2.1750433972071646
floods in mozambique    3.9386315891623402
the next item is the commission statement on flooding in mozambique .    2.1399439667656885
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.3665848488860535
the commission is following with very great concern , as i know all honourable members will be , the emergency situation in mozambique .    2.8923758479401367
the continuing UNK UNK throughout the southern african region aggravated by the UNK UNK have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure .    2.588343241161181
about 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods , about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance .    2.472379674927347
several people have lost their lives , many have disappeared , many have been injured .    2.5075080215986683
the government of mozambique has UNK for humanitarian aid from third countries .    2.626461128138545
the international community including the united states of america , switzerland , south africa , ireland , norway , denmark , italy , sweden and the netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance .    2.3758386394418727
my colleague poul nielson is literally on his way to mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the portuguese secretary of state to assess the situation on the ground .    2.279976575873715
mr nielson will be happy to report back to parliament on the findings of his mission .    2.7689113109298438
just before i say a word about the assistance which has been given by echo so far , perhaps i can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks .    2.865023244751638
first of all , from 1986 to 1989 , i was an overseas development minister and i formed a particular attachment to the people of mozambique .    2.3022612147066055
they were UNK dealing then with huge environmental and political problems , with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war .    3.108990796699302
if ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was mozambique .    2.079250693150719
secondly , that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society .    2.4623208222706134
thirdly , we spent much of this afternoon in this chamber discussing conflict prevention , how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively .    2.2277406445743293
we talked about the importance of the commission developing a series of headline goals for non - military actions related to crises and , if i may say so , if ever there was a case where that is relevant , it is the disaster which has UNK mozambique .    3.040518438912709
let me turn to the assistance provided so far .    2.5637188450577613
last week echo decided to allocate eur 1 million for flood relief , of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the spanish red cross and 150 000 through UNK luxembourg , for operations in mozambique and eur 250 000 to UNK through the german red cross .    1.8964778643195699
these ngos will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care , water and sanitation .    2.5845235251286827
echo is currently preparing a second decision for a further eur 2 million this decision will be implemented through UNK , action contre la UNK , UNK , UNK UNK and UNK pending , of course , the reception and examination of their final proposals .    2.87782640720245
these ngos will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation , provision of shelter , plastic UNK , UNK UNK , blankets , those sorts of things .    2.5652988571248834
they will be concentrating on the UNK of displaced people , on the further prevention of outbreaks of UNK , UNK and other UNK diseases , on the provision of supplementary food to UNK and children at risk , on the provision of seeds and tools , on food security , on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters .    3.2054990133809227
a third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of commissioner nielson .    3.0189597488619064
the commission is also preparing a medium - term community response combining ngo co - financing with european development fund operations to help mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re - establishing the rapid pace of growth that mozambique had worked so hard to achieve .    2.112261525054634
it is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re - construction within a three to four years time horizon .    2.034645550833665
at times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent .    3.1723758338475685
i am not sure that i can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity .    2.4327952794953207
i repeat , commissioner nielson will be happy to report to parliament when he returns from mozambique and the scene of the disaster .    2.433050652542654
mr president , commissioner , mozambique is a young african country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy .    2.0697697579222343
the credit for mozambique ' s success story must be shared equally by its government , by the opposition , but above all , by the people of mozambique .    2.795529200902484
there is a risk , however , that all the effort that has been made in recent years , after all the problems with the peace agreements , with which we are all familiar , will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on mozambique over the last few weeks .    3.5075304260450153
the current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying , as the commissioner has already said : around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees , waiting for a UNK to come and save them .    2.5906817491771403
there have already been hundreds of deaths .    3.021696353707106
the eu and some of its member states , including my own , have provided emergency financial aid , perhaps a little later than they should have , but they have done so , as have the united states and various countries in the region , particularly south africa .    3.1006762809660464
it is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters , followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid .    2.263457426642461
although these floods began three weeks ago , the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire UNK mozambique currently finds itself in : there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport , particularly air transport , to get them out of the situation they are in .    2.435879917639385
this is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment : search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid , including food aid .    2.2693696115142066
i would like to emphasise , however , that the eu and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing .    3.2345376766456533
we must be aware of the aftermath of the floods .    2.817194245755134
it is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way .    2.6412264518664657
rebuilding infrastructure is crucial , because otherwise there can be no development . it is also time for some UNK countries to think about writing off or reducing mozambique ' s debts .    2.422651881951954
if nothing is done now , we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help mozambique in its development go to waste .    3.3910277233822073
i therefore hope that the visit by commissioner nielson and representatives of the portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves .    2.669640111109419
mr president , it has already been said that , after a war which UNK the country in misery , mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions .    2.8692335901336374
although it is currently impossible to UNK how many people have died , we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops .    2.322194874923997
they urgently need aid such as food , water and shelter in order to survive .    2.982195386052612
this immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics , which have apparently already broken out , and aid for reconstruction .    2.2689546291052745
however , the aid needed now is difficult to get through , despite the efforts of the ngos , because the roads , bridges and railway lines are damaged .    2.6995965443843866
helicopters are therefore needed .    2.905591344140712
apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees .    2.639945696256303
the machinery mobilising the aid is too slow .    2.5650840739560596
the pse group of this house has suggested that preventing natural disasters , including preventing conflicts , is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of mozambique .    2.7636960147336227
i must remind you in particular of the efforts of mr rocard during the previous term .    2.845138915910694
the european commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as dipecho . this was intended to be proactive and , using a regional approach , to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population .    2.465933210704997
however , africa is surprisingly not included in the dipecho plans .    2.537684585774543
mozambique , which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster , just as the famine now threatening in ethiopia was foreseeable , is excluded from these plans .    2.481343286423216
the dipecho agenda includes south - east asia , central america and the caribbean .    2.3207672589919244
this is reasonable and we support this , but we have to ask the commissioner , why not africa ?    3.6436000608096335
the pse group has always supported the commission ' s humanitarian aid policy .    3.0739377809446693
we have always supported echo , its policies and its actions , even some which have been disputed by certain bodies . we believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the eu ' s external action .    2.7375315052745295
in view of all this , we also believe the time has come to demand a UNK effort by the commission and the member states , on behalf of those who are now drowning in mozambique .    3.739829019719008
the eur 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the mozambican government at 65 million dollars .    2.509478805131618
the time has also come to demand greater efficiency .    2.5932913253617405
we hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon , the commissioner ' s knowledge of the situation in mozambique and the visit by mr nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help mozambique .    3.2478845769457574
mr president , the situation in mozambique is of the greatest urgency .    3.150812809118615
each day , each hour of delay costs many lives .    2.2953468235920638
there are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims . the water levels continue to rise .    2.2758971440873674
UNK and epidemics seem inevitable .    2.5915215541960572
it is as if the whole world is looking on , UNK .    2.481230158920433
the question is whether the commission has reacted with sufficient alertness .    3.01831881100528
i must admit that i have my doubts about this .    2.9463839866372954
commissioner nielson is flying out today . in european terms , this may be swift action , but given the emergency in mozambique , this is probably very late .    2.524559151463989
unlike a number of member states , the european union has promised only very limited aid so far .    3.6323211822756103
what options does the commission have , to offer effective help fast ?    2.727652215264901
can commissioner patten update us on the international coordination so far ?    2.6858379761965137
why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner ?    2.585698745281135
the international community could also help mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts , not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy , but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential .    2.266479811059535
mr president , all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting mozambique .    2.182732964558766
there are thousands and thousands of displaced persons , a large number of dead , a lack of food and drinking water , and homes and crops have been destroyed .    2.4974509487898247
and this is happening in a country which , because it is one of the poorest in the world , does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary .    3.890640649113517
we know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation , representatives of the portuguese presidency and commissioner nielson left today for mozambique .    3.2692361807630794
we are pleased about this development , but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium - term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately . this should be done in conjunction with the mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires .    2.8734779060648283
thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment , and only international solidarity can save them .    2.58070789828631
i would like to think that the eu is up to the task of providing the people of mozambique with what they expect from us .    3.4777825111697265
mr president , i would like to begin by emphasising , first of all , the timing and the UNK of this debate on the devastating floods in mozambique .    2.8999345630006377
indeed , these floods and appalling weather have resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes and all of their UNK , people who cannot return to their homes after the storms , purely and simply because their homes and their UNK no longer exist . they are no longer there , having been swept away in the UNK .    2.3632490898576366
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there remains , however , one immediate problem : the need to provide help for all mozambicans who have been afflicted , many of whose lives are in danger , in their flooded villages , hoping that they will be UNK .    2.6352933784197243
most of these people can only be saved by UNK , especially helicopters , of which it is clear that too few are in action .    3.377247787893514
as the president of mozambique , UNK UNK , remarked in a dramatic appeal , each passing day may mean death for many mozambicans .    2.5010671803443114
the eu must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively , in terms of quantity as well as quality , and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this .    2.749422076095794
we must do this not only in line with basic humanitarian principles and out of solidarity , but also - and quickly - because we know that mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world . this means that its resources for UNK with the tragedy and then setting about reconstruction are practically non - UNK .    3.001913545346986
we are also under an obligation to help because of another fact , the fact that mozambique is one of the few african countries to have used democratic means to recover from the bloody civil war by which it was consumed for several years after it gained independence .    2.3739787398108767
it is true that mozambique ' s democracy is still far from perfect , as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them .    2.451659337435367
mr president , commissioner , i would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this house ' s attention - which was not really necessary , but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in mozambique . i have some figures here , which i believe are the most up - to - date ones available .    3.081639653574573
more than three hundred people have already died , six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced , two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off , with UNK - five thousand needing to be UNK , some of whom are in UNK , others on roofs .    2.293777751049192
as has already been said , helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid . otherwise , apart from the tragedy created by the floods , the next tragedy will arise : that of a lack of aid to the people , who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods .    2.893137743859488
this would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all .    2.4845273519921816
the commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with mozambique , as i have myself , and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake .    2.753903256681362
i hope that the mission by commissioner nielson and the portuguese state secretary will provide the information that this house needs in order to understand the current situation , and what the most urgent needs are , so that we can help the people of mozambique , who genuinely deserve our help , in their struggle for development .    2.9359394885093417
.    2.489189446364389
could i thank commissioner patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said , the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken UNK valley in mozambique are absolutely UNK .    2.403915267626844
children have lost parents , families are bereft , hopeless , helpless and they have lost absolutely everything .    2.1406100971038406
but of course , as others have said , this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate , woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness .    2.2429402171828072
there is a case as the commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the UNK preparations in place .    2.687361703114209
this morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the gaza region .    2.2979256133010098
the save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet .    2.172961793417665
85 % of the work is within an hour of UNK so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is .    3.2719893251988097
also i would like to say commissioner that european citizens want to know exactly what echo is doing .    2.875154706552785
most of us here would not wish to boast about eur 3 million .    2.599990467579135
clearly also we need to see a massive UNK .    3.6700718605689464
as you say tons of food , water purification equipment , UNK , blankets .    2.875630544609486
are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources .    2.184879880835738
are we ready to pay for those resources ?    2.7356810385897448
mozambique is , of course , one of the poorest countries in the world , but one of africa ' s great success stories with its work on economic growth , on poverty reduction , on democracy in spite , of course , of massive debt pressures .    2.823033959750622
mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured .    2.5008713484700245
how badly the disaster sets mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country .    2.37907717269811
thank you , mrs kinnock .    2.5018359867248625
mr nogueira , we note your interest and concern about this subject but your group is not down to speak and i must abide by the rules of procedure .    2.3760631980535223
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
union economy ( 1999 )    3.4207359398495933
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0041 / 2000 ) by mr katiforis , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the commission document ' the eu economy 1999 review ' [ c5 - UNK / 2000 - 2000 / UNK ( cos ) ] .    2.2160135478360536
the report of the commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the european economy which it finds promising , especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8 % by the year 2001 .    3.690297800819932
this picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of UNK , of growth of only 1 . 9 % per year throughout the 1990s , despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were , however , unable to consolidate .    2.6766368991173493
it would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to UNK themselves , we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self - sustained higher growth levels in our economy .    2.60208941782516
this is the challenge .    3.12049174545238
faced with this challenge the commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal UNK of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents .    2.135344703953532
in europe , in your rapporteur ' s opinion , this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years , not just once but repeatedly .    3.24891789804599
such an attitude has UNK risks which i understand the ecofin council is currently discussing .    2.484321417707846
these risks involve a correction in the us economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long - term eu interest rates .    2.4812372551600883
should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion , what will be our response - more UNK UNK or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn ?    2.610526746409165
it has been my proposal that parliament must recommend an UNK economic policy consisting of two main parts .    2.267278588222583
one is to adopt the commission ' s own excellent , outstanding UNK analysis , and ask the council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected UNK targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible .    2.6805649762931183
a central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19 % , to which it has fallen over the decade , to at least 23 - 24 % of gdp , both in the private and in the public sector .    2.9056120034309716
to allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy , the council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most UNK cows .    3.097135111535935
it would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans - european networks , which have been gathering dust in the UNK for rather too long , to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of european community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to UNK for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact .    2.4838004771867634
this was the first pillar of my recommendation .    2.778421243543489
the second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms , privatisation , de - regulation proposals , as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge - based economy which , as we know , constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the lisbon summit .    2.628404901001989
it has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an UNK programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the european economy out of its state of inertia while one - sided policies are condemned to fail .    2.296421920021806
unfortunately my colleagues of the people ' s party aided and UNK by the liberals in the economic affairs committee found my approach unacceptable .    2.713184521894815
i am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but i must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too UNK to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us , have been expecting from us rather too long .    2.1160107604797096
it is certainly not my task to judge other people ' s alliances but if the people ' s party and the liberals are so desperate to UNK their alliance , let them at least propose something positive , something that has a chance of working , not repeat the same UNK old UNK , ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past , nor oppose other people ' s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them .    2.4226070163860256
i believe that the political message of this parliament should consist of something more original than a mere UNK of the neo - UNK economic mantra .    2.7692289126944596
something more robust than a call to surrender to the UNK of the market economy , something more decent than opposing UNK aims but denying them the means of their realisation .    2.5661375951921053
the report which has come to you from the economic committee UNK in all these respects .    2.922336696701224
unless it is restored in its original form by parliament , accepting the amendments retabled by the socialist group , i must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience .    2.379689635432096
mr president , mr katiforis ' passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report .    2.161192894355739
instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee .    2.5389929667457753
we clearly have different views , one of which is that we believe the development of the european economy can be regarded with confidence .    3.443196226856499
yesterday , when speaking to the committee on economic and monetary affairs , commissioner solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the european economy are excellent .    2.690135118545274
moreover , several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus .    2.571636471107286
they are having to choose , for example , between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit , but clearly avoiding any price rises , or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed , given the eu ' s population growth .    2.4489116421189667
we are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the union , now and in the coming years . it must be taken into account that we have an open , globalised and very competitive economy .    3.2467912631214704
in order to reach and even UNK the leading position of the united states of america , we must avoid interventionism , as proposed initially by mr katiforis , and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures .    3.19433456514399
furthermore , the member states refused to contribute more funds when we discussed agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at union level .    2.6887171800947947
however , we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the european internal market which still has some serious flaws .    3.242675175969367
there are still sectors such as air transport , energy and telecommunications in which , if we compare our unit cost with that of the usa or other countries which are equally competitive at international level , the cost supported by our companies is very high .    2.7772939246345976
this report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the usa is eur 500 and in the european union , on average , it is eur 1 600 .    3.2717942347560203
we therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention .    2.4533393122470404
it is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the european union .    2.549164686485816
mr president , the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in mr katiforis , in my view , only served to call on the european parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people , social UNK and those living a precarious existence in our european union .    2.683434839644727
there is indeed economic recovery , but it only marginally reduces unemployment in europe .    2.653731671220067
the votes of the ppe - de and the liberals have very considerably diminished , and even reversed , the meaning of his message .    2.306557217852747
that is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them , despite our efforts , and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment .    3.0839525042715175
what are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report ?    2.8280088619143138
first of all , the affirmation that there is room for a europe of growth , but a europe of sustainable growth , that particularly respects the commitments of the european union at the conferences in kyoto and UNK UNK .    2.9941544201381025
there is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year UNK , by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions .    2.7014647905394624
a tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport , energy saving and even in UNK travel by communication via the internet .    2.6558003934120045
secondly , even the growth rate of 3 or 4 % , something we consider eminently feasible , will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth .    2.6425031473075484
and we should say so very clearly , it will involve more savings on services , more third systems , more reductions in average working hours , whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things .    2.331901588373823
thirdly , we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in europe , but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital .    2.991135176725028
the lesson learned from the european experience is that where wages are lowest , where the salary ratio is the most flexible , unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest , where the social relations are the best regulated , the unemployment rate is the lowest .    2.44267154405754
mr president , i think that this policy will engender not hope , but deep disappointment in european workers .    2.2693928290184924
the vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the european commission , ecofin and the central bank , but also the european parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo - liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the member states of the european union .    2.8621704599467184
our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the european union and to send the commission and the council the sort of message which the european parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the european union .    3.236194077012222
even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high - level experts , who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas , failed miserably to UNK any support .    2.597277465856476
with this vote , the european parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it , by supporting an extreme neo - liberal economic and social policy ; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything , categorically opposes any form of public sector , UNK workers ' employment , wage , social and insurance rights , imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti - social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and UNK if they want to find a job .    2.3440430537641213
our group categorically condemns this perception and , in this sense , does not intend to support this resolution .    3.3514678894970693
it will be voting against it .    3.2372986887514323
mr president , the report presented by the commission on the union economy in 1999 appears to us to be UNK utter UNK as it scarcely shows why our performance remains UNK below the potential that the immense human resources of europe should allow .    2.4293502478691904
indeed , it is good to note that the forecast of 3 % growth for the year 2000 , which could have seemed rather bold when the commission announced it in november 1999 , now has a serious chance of being achieved , even in the context of continued inflation , since the peak of 2 % for the euro zone in january , nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past .    2.5764206712571376
but we have the impression that this growth , sustained firstly by the performance of the united states , and then by the productivity gains of the new economy , by the new information and communication technologies , is driven by the general world situation , even despite our handicaps .    2.981310628951808
we are well aware of these handicaps , which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility , the excessive mandatory UNK .    2.322516252958168
but let us not forget that there is another one , a new handicap , with the single currency .    3.567420991122911
in fact , the unification of monetary policies and the gradual UNK of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances .    2.2166022885606553
this unification is considered to be positive by the commission ' s report .    3.2220688775394817
but , in reality , we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation .    3.46618233561519
if you add the UNK of a single currency that is not built upon a state , itself based upon a people , you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in brussels , the markets ' suspicion of the euro .    2.5511564776896387
indeed , it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999 , as it favoured growth in an unexpected way , but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is , in fact , symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions .    2.980222877646441
mr president , the present draft resolution is controversial . given the topic it covers , this is hardly surprising .    2.4100308751122297
it is , after all , a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things , especially where the future is concerned .    2.466181380271588
the UNK appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment , but it is , in fact , a short - term policy .    3.1276667675341594
even if he advocates sustainable growth , sustainability does not come into it .    2.456122240596689
given the environmental and demographic developments , if anything , we ought to encourage member states to pursue a selective economic growth policy .    2.540362346797153
more investments , production and consumption only generate short - lived prosperity .    2.0966657324664943
the use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced    2.7112023590191208
other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes .    2.1380149605629937
if member states do not do anything about this , there will be even fewer means for care , education and other important public UNK in the future .    2.8996175757287683
an appeal in favour of a more pro - active government policy comes across as very odd .    2.6509616879677305
it does not take into account the latest eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which , at 2 % , is now at its maximum permitted level .    2.3852696625006518
if , despite this , there is a desire to increase public spending , then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the european central bank raises interest rates again .    2.735459175747496
what the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium - sized enterprises , in particular .    2.6250255655068147
promoting employment , however , is a long - winded affair and comes under structural policy .    3.3038948401484225
member states , in particular , should adopt an effective policy .    3.464975113769109
in order to achieve this , they must be given the necessary leeway .    3.459702185899066
UNK by imposing social convergence criteria and other community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs .    2.6066695901037185
however , shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and UNK is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution .    2.6888426576599227
mr president , first of all , i would like to congratulate my colleague giorgos katiforis on the report he presented to us . not the report he presented to us here today , but the one he presented to the committee on economic and monetary affairs , because politically speaking , these are two completely different reports .    2.6480514673089406
in very general terms , we could call the first report a left - wing one , as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones . the report we have before us now and which mr katiforis is reluctant to defend - and i think that he is right in this - is a UNK report , from which the main conclusions have been removed , and is based on social concerns .    3.1648049138484975
what did mr katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report ?    3.4267329529454726
he proposed an ambitious report , based on an optimistic europe , which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve .    2.4543645176703515
and europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets .    2.7724535261450565
why , for example , was the proposal to increase europe ' s active population to 75 % of the total population removed , when we currently have levels of around 60 % ?    3.0476499992597126
an active population of 60 % is very low compared with that of japan or the united states and we cannot match those countries ' levels of production with such a low rate of employment .    2.457044452471446
we therefore need to UNK our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive .    2.49394942586456
as has been advocated for the lisbon summit , we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training .    2.7343559886017084
we also need investment to grow at a faster rate .    2.273407810005917
we are all familiar with the idea advocated by mr von wogau , according to which what we need is a flexible workforce .    2.7283756202792846
i would like to counter this with the example of portugal , where employment laws are not flexible , and where unemployment stands at less than 5 % - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing , with community support of course , at a rate considerably higher than the community average .    2.389627907414562
what we want , therefore , is for europe to enjoy economic growth , but also be prepared to address social issues .    3.7203262828399657
mr president , like many others , i want to thank mr katiforis for an interesting report .    2.76741937524749
when i read the report and see the picture of the eu ' s economy that is described there , i think it is quite a worrying picture .    3.2706846577275215
investment levels are too low , unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth .    2.7882307319806094
it is not , therefore , perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies , in spite of rumours to the effect that the european central bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it .    2.7284176633841106
the rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself , which is something i agree with .    3.209449676215127
there is far too much talk about stability , convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development .    2.456976784418176
as far as i am concerned , emu cooperation UNK UNK large as a UNK which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present UNK economy .    2.4090765204712574
my conclusions about this differ completely , however , from those of the previous speaker .    3.420911036674471
i believe we have to place our confidence in human resources , partly through a macro - economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training , democratisation and good social conditions .    2.1340246774332523
in this context , i can , in fact , see the emu project ' s main weakness , for it is true that you cannot act like UNK and raise the european economies from above .    2.8771685474621136
instead , you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the member states .    3.053909916073589
mr president , commissioner , i have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my group ' s spokesman , karl von wogau , for the document that we are debating today , and which has had a report written on it , points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success .    3.370792879714873
it points to the problems experienced in 1999 , when , notwithstanding the problems , there was currency and price stability , increased employment , the UNK of a period of upturn , and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment .    3.225821335726129
in terms of outlook , the document points to an UNK , to long - term prospects and the measures required to achieve this , which karl von wogau then UNK to enlarge upon .    2.8606931318235196
i am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one , for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy .    3.3817698638712828
we want to continue along the successful european path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market , to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures .    2.687626147525881
the left - wing of this house does not want to continue along this path , rather it makes dramatic statements such as : what we need is state intervention , not the extension and consolidation of the market economy .    2.7583647071729764
state intervention has always led to a high level of debt , and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment , as well as social justice .    2.94883734962298
that is what the debate we are having is all about , on the subject of which i have this to say to you : we need more freedom and less state intervention .    3.441885370165566
it is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment .    2.0569541334910015
mr president , the economic situation of the european union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people , it is the UNK of insecurity , of low wages , of deteriorating working conditions .    3.273836805518022
the commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor , whereas in france alone , over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an UNK economy .    2.0231330043531357
but you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases UNK every year .    2.04686573615568
the economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority , the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups .    2.086491666991531
but beware of the UNK from the workers and the unemployed , who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but , on the contrary , are getting worse .    2.604949334210407
this is the key ideological struggle for europe facing us .    2.5054401682627434
the key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening , and it is no surprise that this issue has UNK the debate in a house which is known for its consensus and its carve - out politics , and i am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear , because this report is a radical one .    2.864188063539232
this report is a wake - up call to europe .    2.5451192149564594
it is as simple as that .    2.631864446882722
the reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets .    3.0132980840018107
this is the only way to go forward , because the real way to deliver social justice in europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs .    2.8336276333113983
this report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that , because europe has to wake up .    2.884790534175148
it cannot create jobs just by government spending .    2.291256568272783
it cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours , as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people .    1.9718351010319028
the real world simply does not work like that .    2.7506412837753675
and if europe wants to be left behind , left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to UNK and to UNK , than yes , vote against this report tomorrow .    2.703151383073341
but if you want europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of europe , then i would call upon you all to give your support to this report , because it will deliver those jobs , and it will deliver those opportunities , and it is the only way to do so .    3.314505373374063
mr president , the original version of the giorgos katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations , based on the precise observations of the commission report on the economic situation in europe , for a european union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent .    2.8345467249598206
these recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the union ' s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy , which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment .    2.980954944148472
it is this absence of management of the european economy which is responsible , my dear mr von wogau , for the fall of the euro .    3.303220557894594
the report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a european research area and the promotion in all countries of the union of converging measures on research , lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the states in the field of taxation .    2.699670034207289
lastly , the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in president delors ' white paper on the promotion of a european project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services .    2.846417205187237
these recommendations , which , for the most part , are consistent with the guidelines in the portuguese presidency ' s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the lisbon summit , have been rejected or distorted by the committee on economic and monetary affairs of this parliament , by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a european union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets .    3.154824930015407
mr president , this parliament , which has shown itself to be highly europeanist so many times , must , on this occasion , show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures .    2.8986580792505734
mr president , mr katiforis ' s report is exciting .    2.5398694537367863
in its original form , it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy .    2.13030516601018
now , finally , the eu ' s position is , of course , such that we can achieve high growth and seriously take up the fight against unemployment without jeopardising objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget .    3.091492462265383
it is therefore sad that , in committee , the group of the european people ' s party and european democrats and the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously .    2.633628914968814
the debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this .    2.4698856360135935
it is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals , namely that the union ' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments , partly in order to involve all the union ' s citizens in the information society , something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view .    3.083977539399783
i am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant states ' links with trans - european networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and it infrastructure .    2.310862934258496
this is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people , both within the eu and between the eu and the applicant states .    3.5187493981757703
the applicant states ought not merely to tag along behind but , instead , share the eu ' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field .    2.288318242854644
society needs , therefore , to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern it infrastructure which also reaches small companies , poor regions and ordinary citizens .    2.547369104450272
we have that opportunity right now . let us grasp it .    2.4932155105236564
mr president , the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before .    2.895056721573876
i would like to say that i strongly disagree with mrs villiers ' view that this is such an interesting debate .    2.5844142143292257
i think that the european parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and UNK out old political concepts and visions .    2.401662874901927
it would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision .    2.6611250612198574
i think that , in this way , the european parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the european union where a very wide , socio - economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly .    3.1721817220692774
the portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in lisbon .    2.7310071837551964
the commission has done this in its five - year plan by listing one of the four priorities .    2.8333345346796377
the commission document too , which is being drafted for the summit in lisbon , takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas .    2.62289110130175
i think that in adopting this wide socio - economic approach , the european union is taking exactly the right line , not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted .    2.9021227471401114
in this light , i think that the european parliament ' s role will be limited in lisbon , but also in the forum in june for which we might have an invitation , but are UNK as to the input we can have .    3.3014147813603176
are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still UNK in a mould of old political contradictions ?    3.1928189884881837
. ( es ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , firstly i must thank this house for its serious and detailed work .    2.2612670501758894
there is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high - quality information .    2.351437503684194
however , i believe that there are also some elements of consensus .    3.2911996718684384
we all agree that the current economic UNK is good .    2.9414739311670832
we also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment .    2.4841663765718054
i will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which i regard as the essential issue in today ' s debate .    2.6044801071645094
yesterday , as some of you have noted , the committee on economic and monetary affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in europe .    3.1896491720042524
we currently believe that this improvement , which we highlighted in the perspectives in november , may lead to even better results than initially forecast .    2.5533328779087414
employment is growing at a good rate .    2.5956442640685427
despite yesterday ' s figures , we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2 % in december shows that this is an issue which must be pursued . however , the rate of underlying inflation demonstrates that the UNK tendencies are due to certain very specific elements such as the rise in oil prices and exchange rate developments .    3.0723129001723897
when we submitted our report , we referred to the risks posed by growth .    2.710541250422378
we basically highlighted the possibility of UNK difficulties in terms of growth in the usa , and therefore in other parts of the world , and of a sudden rise in inflation .    3.267816685384024
this latter issue may be particularly significant if it causes cost - push inflation . this is why we are continuing to talk about the need for a wages policy compatible with the definitions of inflation which we want to establish .    2.703806370296723
parliament ' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets .    3.328803836345668
the commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem .    3.3431759696884247
anyway , we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more .    2.625604426608827
we all agree that , after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment , certain action must be taken .    2.2759026277923966
we need public and private investment .    2.763831060618724
our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects , among other factors , the imbalances in our labour market .    2.3122721144913867
our aim must therefore be to make this UNK of the economy long - lasting with strong growth and job creation .    3.00689339838175
the latter element continues to be the commission ' s fundamental objective , as we indicated in the prodi document submitted for your debate at the lisbon summit , in that we are aiming for full employment in the medium term .    3.22096280917392
what policy should we use to achieve these objectives ?    2.7816215670112983
in our opinion , the union ' s economy is UNK but we still have UNK production capacity , not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs .    3.1867421800668247
the policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully UNK .    2.6294218609742988
we must define a macro - economic policy which aids growth .    2.407008538929328
this is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth ' s sake .    2.788114879724926
it is simply a budgetary policy which can be coherent with price stability but which also allows us to have an appropriate monetary policy which contributes to growth .    2.4699776656650383
this policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth .    2.5968856092969594
the eu ' s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors , on most of which i believe we agree with parliament ' s analysis .    3.3541478335661905
firstly , private investment must be assisted .    2.4352260718594003
the union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way , but without forgetting public investment .    2.9268389801206616
this has been the major victim in recent years and any improvements in public finances must lead to improvements in public investment . however , this must be carried out with respect for our tax consolidation commitments .    2.932743827381738
our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital .    3.2229927297231837
these are two of the principal challenges for the lisbon summit .    2.686222332311358
it is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions . this will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity , thus enabling our society to grow , together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years .    2.1895029850587497
this is the policy which the commission has defended and will continue to defend in lisbon .    3.190960563487132
common fisheries policy    4.4543973093587725
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :    2.0795770254299333
a5 - UNK / 2000 by mrs attwooll , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the proposal for a council regulation establishing a community framework for the collection and management of the fisheries data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy ( com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cns ) ;    2.351484207321135
a5 - UNK / 2000 by mrs attwooll , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the proposal for a council decision on a financial contribution from the community towards the expenditure incurred by the member states in collecting data , and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy ( com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cns ) .    2.3256885159425242
the proposals for a council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome .    2.913739551943144
so is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other .    3.0832743015239004
i understand that they have been some five years in their gestation .    3.1203540726436767
with the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002 , it is important that swift progress is now made .    2.9439798392659724
to take first the proposal for the council regulation , this makes provision for member states to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations .    2.4473740489282307
both biological and economic information are included .    2.6266958219999568
the proposal also makes provision for member states to produce such data in aggregated form .    2.466306492772408
exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation .    2.6191956908045064
the implementing regulation will establish a minimum community programme and an extended community programme .    2.340030735907433
it appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective , for example , by type of fish stock .    2.420028646607112
the proposal for the council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the community to member states engaged in the collection and management of data .    3.0008665551978058
it also allows the commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects .    2.640035868077985
the only apparent sanction for member states that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme .    2.906418012772104
two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the committee .    3.0439857079513306
the first relates to the degree of involvement of the commission .    3.135535014280239
the original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations .    2.4290967465615583
the commission would only receive a copy of any such UNK if it requested one .    2.3108454324707446
since , however , the community is funding the exercise , it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment .    3.5176240686675215
thus , amendment no 6 , while maintaining the freedom of member states to transmit the data to international organisations , requires that it also be sent annually to the commission .    2.767700777124693
this change is taken in conjunction with amendments nos 1 , 4 and 7 .    2.8275451320722786
amendment no 1 clarifies the point that , although the data are to be scientifically based , they are being collected for wider decision - making purposes .    3.083111036504188
amendment no 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally .    2.7100054024359506
amendment no 7 calls on the commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation .    2.9494945384276043
it is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole .    2.491480295203821
the other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation .    2.494481132439616
first , in respect to economic data , amendment no 2 makes two changes .    2.688503721569101
one attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued .    2.6167964790528777
the other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue , subsidies , interest received , etc . , with a reference simply to volume of sales .    2.2420463171444793
it is considered that without these changes UNK high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in member states and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality .    2.6084789037108043
secondly , in respect to the environmental data , the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information .    2.685167345849319
the commission has , however , made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind .    2.844004162086646
it has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by member states at a later stage .    2.8832686677685504
amendment no 3 brings into the UNK of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems .    2.8536379186297953
this will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary .    2.618935473023292
it should be stressed that the amendment does not in any way require the commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes .    2.5699896433781277
it merely permits the commission to do so should it so wish .    3.2451282508124493
as already stated the proposal for the council decision falls into two parts .    3.1001846274905853
the first is concerned with financing the member states in implementing the community programmes .    2.867326969331657
the second is to allow the commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects .    2.8570108283078595
there are some minor amendments : amendment no 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to member states can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management , compilation , UNK , etc . amendments nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that member states will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve ; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation .    2.90564020196205
amendments nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority .    2.40002934729426
more significantly , under amendment no 1 , the fisheries committee accepts the recommendation of the budgets committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1 ( b ) rather than heading 3 of the financial perspective .    2.477276141778486
although in its preliminary draft budget the commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 ' internal policies ' , parliament created a new budget line b1 - 500 to finance the measures under discussion .    1.9913202528079414
this provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available .    3.602962550714137
) mr president , i believe we totally agree with mrs attwooll ' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two commission proposals , intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio - economic situation of the fisheries sector , come at a critical time .    2.872541001633537
the proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner .    2.790304186720762
this will only be true , of course , if the data can actually be obtained because , as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur , the commission ' s proposal does not establish any element of UNK on the member states .    3.40957337103971
the sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance , which is not very significant anyway , will not be received .    2.846005434353406
in view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector , as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the magps , i believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector , we will end up with total confusion . for example , some member states will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources , according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data .    2.7545168906259487
i am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management . this has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory , as with the magps .    2.1911892946626965
in view of this problem , which seems to me to be the most serious , the fisheries committee report improves the proposal in certain important points , particularly with the rapporteur ' s suggestion of more reasonable submission deadlines and the request for monitoring by the commission .    2.8108014890253687
my group has included two reasonable requests .    2.395916901685996
the first is that data originating from studies and UNK should be used as a source of data whose collection could otherwise be UNK . the second is that the requirement for data referring strictly to the taxation of enterprises should be removed from the commission ' s proposal , bearing in mind that this tax data does not come within the community competence .    2.678404894098421
as a result , this report is very satisfactory and , on behalf of my group , i therefore ask for its approval .    3.012189134785921
i wish at the outset to congratulate mrs attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report .    2.4905027231273693
i welcome the establishment of a community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which i believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish .    3.126681892509075
it is important , of course , that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various member states must be standardised across the community and , as stated by the rapporteur in her report , must be in compliance with international provisions .    3.2790670118385497
i welcome the availability of funding for national programmes , even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met .    2.515381871263193
i agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the commission .    3.232660346771074
otherwise the purpose of collecting and UNK data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue .    2.2106922090683727
sound , UNK information is in the best interests of the industry .    3.5509187406055207
i believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the union where there is no alternative source of employment .    3.0499706126934973
i am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities , the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our group has no difficulty in supporting these reports .    2.552763841010736
mr president , behind the report , which is an honest one , by mrs attwooll , which we shall vote for , we see the european fisheries policy . it is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea , which is immense and without borders , it is not easy to manage fish on the move .    3.1989758579218006
we are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating UNK .    2.726936467224597
it is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources , but what is the point if europe restricts its catches and world catches increase ?    2.5299144525634567
what is the point of banning european drift nets in the UNK d ' UNK or elsewhere , if japan , korea and UNK use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch ?    2.589994311626143
what is the point of destroying the french fishing fleet , at UNK or elsewhere , for example , if every year france has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed , while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it .    2.1131787988319544
what is more , the movement of fish is like co2 or like capital , it is not european , but world - wide .    2.5087551300410875
brussels , which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task , now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset .    2.2422493148214753
together with mrs attwooll , i am in favour of collecting scientific data , and of fair and accurate checks , on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the UNK of the administrations . i am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists , like professor UNK , or others , that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing - although it plays a serious and negative part - but more to do with UNK , the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers , which have a much greater effect than human influence .    2.8972063494923805
but to enlighten the decision makers , let us practise honest science , without the UNK motive of having the european union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats .    2.5314589869808835
for if we must preserve the UNK of fish , we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen .    3.4870292292643614
instead of always following behind the united states , in seattle , in kosovo , in iraq , perhaps the europe of brussels could suggest , over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the north atlantic , in the pacific , over and above the regulation of tuna , cod or other things , that europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing , a kind of UNK bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between UNK , japanese , UNK , russians , europeans , and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity .    2.5980089159816755
that would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism , as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the oecd .    2.2213538828974912
the northern ireland fishing industry has received many hard UNK from this union .    2.4423483076572405
they have seen their own waters UNK by others while they have had to put up their own boats and UNK from fishing .    2.36955964091921
the recent decisions on the cod quota for the irish sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the northern ireland fishing industry .    2.32115861734287
i see the commissioner UNK but i speak with the authority of all the political parties in northern ireland , a diverse UNK but all agreed on this one issue .    2.617055002278187
the european union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves , which have been totally rejected out of hand , for the conservation of their own fish stocks , then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard .    2.5225320435764855
at a recent visit in brussels these fishermen ' s representatives , duly accredited , travelled from northern ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared .    1.9317775971125537
that is scandalous , their case ought to be heard .    2.817927594407834
it should be put on record , and i want to put it on record today .    3.4964958333222804
i UNK in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the irish sea and at that very time haddock had a special , spectacular increase of breeding in the irish sea so the scientists can be wrong .    2.166221648170196
as i have said all the northern ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but UNK to northern ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this union .    2.1721919235118414
mr president , mrs attwooll ' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the member states . this is particularly true given that the commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002 .    3.2455168120241145
however , the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the commission ' s proposal .    2.815858406538976
it should be pointed out that not all the member states have the same amount of data .    3.398070853168076
some have different sectors and , in view of the volume of data to be sent , could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data , if the same deadlines are set .    2.9724207755749266
these deadlines for submission must therefore be UNK accordingly .    2.6922258078382435
much of this data is confidential , as has also been mentioned , which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises .    2.9217471263034285
we must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data .    2.6333983492190103
some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises .    3.1261619438623947
finally , mr president , as i must be brief given the time constraints , i must congratulate our rapporteur , mrs attwooll , on the important work which she has carried out within our committee .    3.357386133853862
i too want to congratulate mrs attwooll and say that i agree with most of what she said .    3.070474826785957
i regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all member states .    2.6335462281917312
in view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information , economic as well as biological .    3.665156440321676
in the past somebody said to me i have been defending the decisions the commission makes .    2.669562350305168
i am informed when i take a closer look that the information is in fact quite UNK - UNK with UNK coming from here and there and no clear , proper economic and biological picture emerging .    2.3612715815322525
it is not easy , indeed i could speak for everybody in my constituency that live in the coastal areas too and say that they are agreed on one thing , that the european union is the source of all their problems and all their difficulties .    2.6978353667944583
well , i do not agree with them but i think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information , and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it , then we will have bad decisions .    2.9957133649539784
mr president , commissioner , no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry , particularly in view of the reform of the cfp in 2002 .    2.5101387914051987
we are also of the opinion that community funds should be set aside to fund these activities .    2.693950702069356
a common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements .    2.6068460734947236
to this end , more extensive , compatible , uniform data is required , and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the union ' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted .    2.613793210968969
however , we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities , differences , varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries , and that they will not be disregarded , penalised or even eliminated due to the UNK of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies , as has sometimes occurred in the past .    2.9966605441040572
a case in point is the mediterranean , including my country ' s fishing industry .    3.1510533136331937
after years of the cfp for the mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid , regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy , with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation .    2.2279914718589002
this is a worthy objective , the implementation of which , however , has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of mediterranean species of fish .    2.59966780225359
a subsequent regulation , regulation UNK , adopted , not by chance , in 1999 , permitted certain exemptions , in particular for special cases .    2.6011730860166598
the time period will UNK on 31 may next , to be precise , when the commission will present a proposal .    3.3374381903728367
we hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that , from the point of view of biological implications , resources are , to some extent , sustainable .    2.9341006269595433
thank you very much , commissioner fischler .    1.953663089635656
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6891396379085435
combating certain fish diseases    3.292401268282847
the next item is the report a5 - 0036 / 2000 by mr hudghton , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the proposal for a council directive amending directive 93 / 53 / eec introducing minimum community measures for the control of certain fish diseases ( com ( 1999 ) - c5 - 0168 / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cns ) .    2.2366589049305157
infectious salmon anaemia is a UNK UNK disease which was first recorded in norway in 1984 , then in canada in 1986 and first found in european union territory in may 1998 in scotland .    2.0898507679733864
although the virus has been found in other species , the disease itself is so far confined to salmon .    2.1516720653208403
the virus is known not to survive above 25o celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists ; it simply cannot survive in warm - blooded creatures .    1.8923533705272493
the scottish salmon - farming industry is the biggest in the eu , spread throughout some of europe ' s most peripheral communities .    2.7487630824217004
it sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around eur 800 million annually .    2.064092963697452
it is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of europe that the disease be brought under control and , if possible , eradicated .    2.9657753171858716
the current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be UNK whether affected by the disease or not .    2.377735842916094
the intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate isa and to do so as quickly as possible .    2.478065529218239
the reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain , let alone eradicate isa , and while failing to deliver its objectives , the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance .    2.2471267720435297
the proposed changes are twofold : the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle .    2.492107005799996
this is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at european level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine .    2.448172416182531
the second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms , working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm .    2.333702116380498
this approach has been used very effectively in norway where new reports of isa are down to a handful of cases a year having UNK at some 80 - 90 cases per year in the early 1990s .    2.080586193863181
i also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of council decision 90 / 424 / eec by specifically including isa in its UNK list of diseases , thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50 % commission , 50 % member state .    2.2004017806166973
i thank colleagues in the fisheries committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and i in particular thank my scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process .    2.8898092013602357
i am opposing amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the fisheries committee .    2.336400701561648
most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text .    2.5103879622389673
in particular , i have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon , the need to investigate the source of isa and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks .    2.9255005408237618
these amendments by the green component of the greens / european free alliance group are designed to provide justification for amendment 13 .    2.178927326829226
this amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish , whether diseased or not , from an affected farm from being sold and i must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold .    2.3555740958618503
there is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold .    2.5239853955797686
amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the UNK UNK statistics from scotland and from norway .    2.7929133129693136
in scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective .    2.28152877327518
it is in all of our interests to ensure that in scotland too we contain isa and prevent its further spread .    2.838914037840027
this comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site - to - site transmission , security measures to UNK escapes , treatment of waste and UNK , methods of detection and diagnosis , UNK and rotation , UNK of equipment and many , many more .    2.282395069680402
some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers , others will be incorporated into codes of practice .    2.412714120815869
all will be beneficial , not just in relation to isa but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required .    2.6098568613116364
your votes , colleagues , in favour of my report in full , as endorsed by the fisheries committee , will be a very important part of a wider isa control package based on the reality of scotland ' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others .    3.1218607072849394
i congratulate mr hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable members of parliament to do likewise .    3.0241012246216514
as he said , fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural scotland and at a time when the rural areas of scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years , the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend .    2.1542748531706453
now , as he said , in excess of 85 000 tons of salmon is now produced in scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than eur 800 million annually .    2.1049131091789905
regrettably , although isa was first detected in scotland only two years ago , it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around UNK other farms are affected in some way or another .    2.2892124692721585
wild salmon , UNK and UNK have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment .    2.9019543653335966
but i must say that despite the scare - UNK of the greens , it has to be emphasised that isa cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans , and i must repeat what mr hudghton said , that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold - water species .    2.8830035793628417
it can , nevertheless , in the affected fish , lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around eur 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures .    2.2122892082451933
so this report , mr president , provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the uk and elsewhere should respond to the disease .    3.6243481093463115
by recommending the introduction of a method of UNK and gradual culling , similar to the system used successfully in norway , the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence , not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto UNK clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter .    2.6033090621610038
by recommending the research , development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate isa , the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine .    2.282544803999698
so i thoroughly recommend and hope that the parliament will support this excellent report .    3.009317257715307
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr hudghton , also for this report .    2.4669956103565394
scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the european union and UNK 90 % of the british UNK industry .    3.2786283910021874
the industry is located in some of europe ' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities .    2.7259427651767076
in recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth eur 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence .    2.070723240236046
i believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with infectious salmon anaemia which is both practical , realistic and also achievable .    2.2485070231651134
as for the amendments , i oppose the amendments tabled by mr hudghton ' s green colleagues , that is numbers 7 to 13 , not because i do not care about the risks to human health but because , according to scientific evidence , the virus does not survive beyond 25o celsius and according to medical evidence , human beings at that temperature are dead .    2.444299771835474
i too would like to compliment mr hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development .    2.7290521096837663
i too agree that amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate , indeed amendment 13 would not merely UNK the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules .    2.2317268551840277
this is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming .    2.9349971900922323
mr hudghton has already referred to the final report of the uk joint government industry working group on isa and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens , not just in farms affected by isa .    2.4065911864190555
secondly , looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the katiforis report later this evening , paragraph 28 is of particular importance .    2.557413767124125
this calls on the commission and member states to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment .    3.412145976710852
thirdly , referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data , i very much hope that the commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but i believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment , not the way that is suggested in amendments 7 to 13 , and i hope honourable members will reject them .    3.3489760718037527
mr president , i do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues , who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers ' health .    2.3839790414518536
this infectious salmon disease is caused by an UNK which breaks down the blood of salmon , causing death .    2.2296830318919807
it UNK very easily through UNK in UNK water , etc . under the 1993 directive , not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected , exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution .    2.385020243410325
what we currently propose is to UNK this directive , so that we do not UNK all the fish , but only the fish that are found to be diseased .    3.2455195782270625
for the others , well , we would have time to see what would happen , according to local circumstances .    3.371425560367714
i think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way .    3.0398101452064292
i would particularly draw my colleagues ' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of UNK has every advantage for the human race and that , consequently , there is no risk to men .    2.5093163725573193
what about women ?    2.9756660608215917
nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard .    2.3052481522994874
there is also a risk to the environment , because we know that there is an UNK period in salmon and that , consequently , if they are UNK , they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk .    3.5853459513318615
there is another risk to the environment as well , because this disease is transmitted to wild fish , as we have seen .    3.012785102512549
for this reason , together with my colleague , UNK mckenna , we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the commission .    3.0691157302435155
mr UNK explained why we support some aspects of the commission ' s proposal , in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish , but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy .    2.8260483549863307
now people have said here that norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of isa and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the norwegian approach , but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the norwegian policy and that of the community .    3.1061835963522793
this is a community policy which will effect ireland as well - where i am from - should similar unfortunate events occur .    2.136455283658992
there are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease , UNK periods , restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others . before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the UNK , we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster .    2.4715433104019318
and people have spoken in the past about bse .    3.1313862254144618
for many years the greens were calling for the bse issue to be addressed .    2.5501137771920193
had it been at that time , you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the eu a huge amount of money .    2.546897036239765
so it also has to do with environmental protection .    3.296271347350383
the protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health .    2.9334152371253714
i would like to thank mr hudghton for his excellent report on isa and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening .    2.7371001150898806
the commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms .    2.2612573023763702
however , this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating isa .    2.520258119543271
nor can it be done , if the proposal involves a threat to public health .    3.099433223069006
the environmental implications must also be taken very seriously .    2.942337909914491
i am advised that isa is considered non - UNK for humans and mammals .    2.2555664344941406
the disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals .    2.5225485168210615
the virus UNK cold - blooded animals .    2.397794755078195
it does not replicate at temperatures above UNK centigrade and would , if present in fish for human consumption , be UNK when ingested .    2.082509226956555
in no way , however , can diseased fish be used for human consumption .    3.186941917382623
as an extra precaution , i am UNK this advice to our scientific committee .    2.749015183180824
during the debate , a number of important issues linked to our disease - control strategy have been raised including compensation .    2.547652855104143
i deeply regret the losses suffered by the scottish salmon industry .    2.250342689275205
you may know that with effect from 15 january 2000 , under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance , member states may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture .    2.4081503452705464
the commission ' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument .    3.042409355011028
council decision 90 / 424 constitutes another instrument for community financial support in case of disease outbreaks .    2.278990547104934
i must emphasise , however , that there are serious constraints .    3.7582430475591364
budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set .    3.0004896933233303
so further thought is necessary .    2.6053859130632553
i regret therefore that i am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through decision 90 / 424 .    2.7383164886652884
this is in particular the case for amendments nos 3 and 5 .    3.193064777492636
i agree , however , with the statement in amendment no 2 saying that no compensation has been made UNK to salmon farmers .    3.3057908511408645
i am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance .    2.8971882010060646
the commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon .    2.2233141723707113
the intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations .    2.9257140136325273
i believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in amendment no 4 .    2.8458832506699965
experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers .    2.289666027701538
those could perpetuate an infection .    2.506655245086702
i therefore am not able to accept amendment no 4 .    2.9836506274388452
you also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease .    3.27317521483822
i agree that such research is needed and i understand this is at present being organised in the united kingdom .    2.4683342846746443
i will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals .    2.444634675888109
it must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the community must be organised .    2.7320206525016
in this context i am happy to partly accept amendment no 1 , taking into account , however , that scientific investigations are not done by the commission but that the commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the member states .    3.059856895728147
i also can partly accept the part of amendment no 6 saying that directive 93 / 53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence .    2.607249675448368
as i pointed out earlier , the available scientific evidence is that isa is not a threat to health .    2.566268981562916
i can therefore agree to amendment no 10 with the proviso that the words , and i quote , " of the highest possible standard " are replaced by " are safe " .    2.4673874663764677
fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks .    2.320294891184496
in this context , a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open .    2.6545148228106616
it is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of isa is needed .    2.599427551420289
diseased fish should not remain in the farms and i am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment .    2.6245248655848568
for that purpose , i propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the commission . this is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods .    2.977691287766147
i also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate .    2.1786374385731966
the procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact .    2.6633672664815218
bearing this in mind , i can agree to accept amendment nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter .    2.6102418137574768
i am also very UNK towards amendment no 9 , but i believe that it can be better formulated so as to join , at the same time , environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies .    2.9583622102151947
i do not feel in a position to accept amendments nos 12 and 13 .    2.5511221105216753
it is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk .    2.688481577589745
i believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned .    2.447089585240985
i look forward to parliament ' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward .    2.850576965004955
i can partly accept amendment no 11 .    2.8682967232848307
finally , i would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the treaty .    2.960389171098165
i believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward .    2.4673684558694977
we remain committed to eradicating the disease , an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon - farming sector .    2.698827131166393
i hope that in accepting our proposal the european parliament acknowledges our commitment and i would be very grateful for that .    3.2447189176256757
thank you very much , commissioner byrne .    2.3887673313977844
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6891396379085435
protection of juvenile marine organisms    3.0045665276458013
the next item is the report a5 - 0035 / 2000 by mr gallagher , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the proposal for a council regulation amending for the fourth time regulation ( ec ) no 1626 / 94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the mediterranean and for the fourth time regulation ( ec ) no 850 / 98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms ( com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - 0040 / 2000 - 1999 / 0222 ( cns ) .    2.1514209813836893
the proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one .    2.6522032267141755
by now , my colleagues in the fisheries committee and indeed in the parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice .    2.8857927872791485
the body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tuna .    2.4150363600136684
this intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the european union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna - like species in the atlantic and the adjacent seas including the mediterranean .    2.635913608800548
this body was established back in march 1969 and is formally obliged to meet UNK , however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice .    2.3091932785068954
the body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks .    2.6144476396642338
this body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics , finances and administration , compliance and conservation and management measures .    1.8768031414924715
they have also four panels dealing with UNK tuna , with temperate tuna , the north and temperate tuna south and other species .    2.017636823820498
these panels are UNK to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention .    2.527456095058236
proposals made by the panels are then presented to the commission and the commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties .    3.4907485674472927
these conditions are binding , however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six - month period .    2.152771003148173
the european union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in community law .    2.3412765235140034
at a iccat meeting in november 1998 in UNK de UNK , changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna .    2.5119430205947157
iccat also made recommendations in 1974 , 1994 and 1996 .    2.4161555670635435
as of now , it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1 . 8 kilos .    2.456173915170078
at its recent meeting in november 1998 , the iccat standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western atlantic and eastern atlantic and mediterranean bluefin tuna populations .    2.3210440008888265
the information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans .    2.1335904463446327
it was agreed that the scrs should present a study at the 1998 meeting . it was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to UNK sustainable UNK by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks .    2.0166565616205747
it was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine , in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock .    2.127196763814261
following all of the research , the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 august to 31 august .    2.179379693090584
it is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations .    2.5536437489068766
bluefin tuna is the world ' s most expensive fish UNK up to eur 90 000 per UNK at the UNK in UNK and , of course , the indication of the importance of the mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons .    3.104590548037535
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine .    2.2921344734028515
the mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles .    3.1782111455686177
the minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age .    2.7841303560422572
the measures agreed in november 1998 are binding since 21 june , i repeat 21 june 1999 , months before the communication was forwarded to the parliament ' s fisheries committee and 9 months almost to the date .    2.3015391123266777
now i believe , commissioner , this is not good enough and that in the future we must learn and that reports must be submitted to the parliament ' s fisheries committee before decisions are taken , otherwise then we are nothing further than a rubber stamp and i know that is not the intention of the commission or the commissioner but let us learn from mistakes of the past .    3.13529884901005
mr president , this proposal aims to incorporate into community law an iccat recommendation from 1998 which should have been binding from june 1999 , but which only reached this house at the end of last year .    2.4338475569618994
the commission ' s legislative delay on certain issues should not surprise us , but for the fact that this is a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organisations on the protection of such a threatened resource as tuna .    3.1701684408493045
the mediterranean , particularly in some zones , is an extremely important spawning area for the bluefin tuna which is of enormous commercial value .    2.9962223197439686
this is why iccat recommended this closed zone in the adriatic and toughened the conditions for UNK zero - age fish .    2.079064716566513
as rightly said by the rapporteur , both measures are totally and fully justified which is why we have no alternative but to ask for their approval .    2.9148630197338923
however , i also agree with mr gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the UNK of the commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into community law .    2.65460046135308
we are , for example , still waiting for the proposal for a regulation on banning the import of bluefin tuna from UNK and UNK . the recommendation for this dates from 1996 .    3.0338860021994165
apparently , according to my information , the fisheries directorate - general sent a note last january to the trade directorate - general which is still on the preparatory work .    2.7679415743803246
four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable .    2.292298197642314
we have listened to the commission ' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation . this has simply left us with an image of an UNK bureaucracy .    2.648169420917022
yet i have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the council and parliament procedure .    2.757139685177075
it is clear that we must find a solution to this problem , either at the time of the commission report on regional fisheries organisations or , if possible , before then .    3.139749253058391
i do not suppose that anybody in this house would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms .    2.664786975562181
indeed , it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources .    2.9106609641205403
all laudable stuff .    2.80278523651376
there can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance .    2.7071973054940877
as a king sport UNK myself , i would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when UNK from the port of UNK in yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to UNK pounds .    2.657192976318561
i do not know what the metric equivalent is .    2.4053405834348944
so i support the findings of iccat and i support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues .    2.832137881305823
my concern though with this debate is that we are UNK whilst rome UNK .    3.699690703642979
the common fisheries policy is not working .    3.025317057209591
for all of the high - minded talk about conservation , the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster .    2.965430911523465
in mixed fisheries , you cannot UNK .    2.508969630186763
the sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless .    2.239312754544986
from a uk perspective there is also a deep - seated political objection to the cfp .    2.5266538794358597
many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it .    2.4236156238222413
let me illustrate this with a topical example .    2.38609100109698
in february , commission regulation UNK / 2000 designed to protect irish sea cod stocks was issued .    2.522213703291525
it means that in UNK , 30 UNK boats are tied up until the end of april .    3.009211548634596
the scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done .    2.7498406905474257
however , more than a dozen large belgian UNK trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the uk fleet to do so .    2.3287721944057242
the cfp does not assist in conservation and is UNK the british public to the point where we demand to re - establish control over our own territorial waters .    2.2946582551365844
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , mr gallagher ' s report on the fourth amendment of the regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee . it was actually approved unanimously for which i congratulate the rapporteur .    2.6553065890002396
these decisions must be defended by the commission in iccat . this is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the european parliament ' s role .    3.1056233958939363
mr fischler , i am delighted that the commission responded favourably to our request in the last and constructive debate which we had on this issue and has asked to attend our next meeting this month to inform us about the future preparatory iccat meeting .    3.003811694523602
our rapporteur ' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded .    2.774911711973966
i must highlight the part of the report which states that , in 1975 , with regard to the size of bluefin tuna , a minimum limit of 6 . 4 kg with a 15 % tolerance in the number of fish was recommended for the entire atlantic .    2.765341956182167
however , according to the scrs study , the regulation establishing the 6 . 4 kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the east atlantic and mediterranean fisheries .    2.2908990076960607
the UNK reports that , according to italian , french and spanish customs authorities , illegal bluefin fishing and landings of small fish are on the increase .    2.128290387785688
i cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time .    3.1115441808632816
however , i must again congratulate our rapporteur , mr gallagher .    3.266129277503042
thank you very much , commissioner fischler .    1.953663089635656
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845

fishing and the environment ( bergen 13 - 14 march 1997 ) : UNK report    2.7160423038495636
the next item is the report ( a5 - UNK / 2000 ) by mr varela suanzes - carpegna , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the second report from the commission to the council and the european parliament on the implementation of the " statement of conclusions from the intermediate ministerial meeting on the integration of fisheries and environmental issues , 13 - 14 march in bergen " ( com ( 1999 ) 270 - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cos ) .    2.572450647214972
mr president , mr fischler , my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues , as discussed at the ministerial meeting in bergen .    2.3627209605074087
this integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general .    2.8624583149045626
to fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow , not just for our fishermen and the people of europe but , more seriously , for humanity as a whole .    2.6330609879161995
the common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect , perhaps more so than most people , both europeans and non - europeans , would believe .    2.4430296477926867
i have therefore asked the european commission to produce a publication which lists all the measures of the common fisheries policy aimed at UNK and protecting resources . this will serve to publicise our protectionist actions .    2.6750868276032347
we have also asked parliament ' s own dg iv to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the committee on fisheries .    3.081507917694996
the revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time - limited challenge facing us . we must completely overhaul , modernise or , if you prefer , update this policy in its entirety .    2.4664524179750735
i would stress that the whole of the cfp must be revised , particularly the part on the protection of fish stocks .    3.1755040746668772
this is the basis of my request to the european commission and the services of this house .    3.924443098297826
i do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy ' s effectiveness which must therefore , in my opinion , be significantly improved .    2.886378272602541
i do not want to and cannot go into too much detail , mr president , given the time constraints and also the interpreters ' UNK .    3.0054078661053936
however , i will just remind you that the meeting in bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created .    2.5280758193862436
the president - in - office informed our committee that the current portuguese presidency intended the cfp to be regarded as a policy for ensuring the sustainability of our resources . this must be our objective in europe and throughout the world .    2.657006989893842
in this respect , important community initiatives arose from bergen which have always been supported by our committee . these are aimed at re - establishing the breeding UNK , reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources , protecting juveniles , species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries .    2.0131785996773806
these initiatives , together with effective systems of control , are the key aspects for the future of fisheries .    3.257925617118019
however , we do not have to resort to extreme solutions , as mr katiforis initially suggested in his draft report .    2.7646111760936782
i am referring to this now because i will not have time to speak later on .    2.6771985507611227
i must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by mr katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee .    3.052903258817813
coincidence or fate has worked to bring together in this part - session both my report and mr katiforis ' s report on fisheries and the environment . the oral question from our committee on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the accident involving the tanker erika will also be considered tomorrow .    2.7407764748525296
maritime transport , industrial and urban pollution and waste also have negative effects on fisheries whose problems do not just come from overfishing .    2.1743422690234295
thank you very much , commissioner fischler .    1.953663089635656
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6891396379085435
fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment    2.584220925286551
the next item is the report a5 - UNK / 2000 by mr katiforis , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the communication from the commission to the council and european parliament : fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment ( com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cos ) .    2.233958061260889
the problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this house many times in the past .    2.6918472927247477
this particular communication from the commission forms part of the commission ' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other community policies .    3.288517860854726
the overall strategy of the commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over - exploitation and / or environmental degradation .    2.4081387759508797
the alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks UNK and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports .    2.034693146857643
i understand i have been described in a spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because i have said such things .    2.7056242103204777
of course , i am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting .    2.536897800039628
this is an unwise policy .    2.5895872061722063
in particular , the communication calls for control of fisheries pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine aqua systems , improved measures for nature conservation in the marine environment , in the UNK management of coastal areas , improved training , information transparency and a greater contribution from scientific research to fisheries management .    2.248721264902028
all of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the community level and in the various international fora in which the community UNK .    3.3495237393356043
they should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the community UNK .    2.8426720499044236
whilst the communication reveals the commission ' s worthy intentions in this field , it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made .    3.10007682710181
one can quote from the communication .    2.749919185449874
over - exploitation is so severe in community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent .    1.9909847684835908
that appeared in the communication published last july .    2.659370485574012
since then , the fisheries council meeting of 16 december decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000 .    2.0488422767167416
furthermore , the commission adopted an emergency regulation for a recovery plan for irish sea cod , effectively calling a halt to cod fishing in the irish sea between 14 february and 13 april due to the crisis in the species .    2.253175448531571
these are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over - exploitation .    2.3085286627506316
what can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities ?    2.7868352564267487
the first consideration must be to recognise that community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced .    2.5580054931506555
secondly , the principles of such community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the community is a party .    3.021321244404621
thirdly , the european union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources .    2.310354240931715
more controls would be placed to prevent oil UNK such as that of the erika in the bay of biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste UNK .    2.4299247584425525
recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas .    2.511081216628547
such pressures are greatest in europe .    2.453073565156001
in this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches , fishing gear which destroys the UNK and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive UNK .    2.4739373162985605
a quota management system such as that existing in new zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative .    2.1728438258265923
under this system , and given the total allowable catch for a species , a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the UNK can trade amongst themselves , fish themselves or UNK the rights to other fishermen for a certain time .    2.1543067452841758
the property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves .    3.2551568020520136
such a market organisation can reap better long - term prospects for the fishing industry .    2.595549935887175
at present dear colleagues , we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea , nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system .    2.595738477215531
the fishery sectors in europe face serious problems and i am a great supporter of the fishery sector .    2.7395421297585014
i therefore call upon the commission and the council to find the information , the political will to provide genuine long - term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short - UNK .    2.9085828263319797
i recommend the report to the house .    3.168803328653864
the environment committee is generally pleased with the commission ' s communication and we are also pleased that the fisheries committee adopted all our amendments .    3.3769118824827045
it is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide - ranging and UNK than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by - catch .    1.971178547916441
we welcome the intention of the commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the eu including the common fisheries policy .    3.375086955828258
after all , the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into community policies .    2.834273417540302
but as has been pointed out , the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial . this is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual .    3.0003733648948203
the un fish stocks agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard .    2.698981433813332
one aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control .    2.3346873607514937
all the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected .    2.863982954316033
control is a member state competence and the council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries .    2.60132333784548
this is a good step forward , but as the commission and the fisheries committee continually point out , much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all member states .    3.151688062410779
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .    2.103161000597149
mr president , fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment . most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire community regions .    2.0128649432591708
however , some people ' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic , ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and UNK .    2.4571980554154464
i regret to say that this report , due to its link with the environment , seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular UNK .    3.2733372179604365
if mr katiforis ' s report had been approved in its initial wording , none of the members of the committee on fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being UNK .    2.608269308303047
the relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious .    2.647731968357496
yet it is very wide - ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport .    2.460831594595377
to blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong .    2.1456487926156202
our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which i tabled 14 , many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which i thank him sincerely .    3.245171849596993
according to these , for example , the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea .    2.2460412038819935
others , like amendment no 4 , which request financing for biological closures , also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force , although admittedly there is room for improvement in these .    2.346198455045784
i therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee ' s debate . these two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks .    2.8338749468657514
as i have said many times before , the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the erika .    3.091403356484391
mr president , mr katiforis ' s report has the virtue of having brought life , debate and controversy to a communication in which the european commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions , although recognising its inability to put these into practice .    2.4322940687961507
yet i must say that i disagree with many of his proposals because i am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries .    3.0612306605553576
i agree with the rapporteur that the european fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated .    2.988450014239933
however , what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the commission and the member states to take decisions and apply the current regulations .    3.0831951297242584
maritime transport , employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment .    2.4885400584190966
as for the structural funds , certain examples could be mentioned but i will leave this for another day .    2.546249489915198
the european parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries .    3.6614427566821615
the commission and member states should be meticulous in respecting the tacs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria . the same yardstick should be used for everyone .    2.451228922349024
as mr katiforis says , discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept .    2.6303970529668086
twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back .    2.342386772087887
this house has already indicated its opposition to UNK and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the UNK of the national and community authorities .    2.8353832200765043
we socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector .    2.6438200887072827
it is therefore essential that the commission UNK an information campaign on the cfp with this message .    2.8023320093171047
without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control , damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity .    2.965117550864248
mr president , i very much appreciate this report by mr katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment .    2.2459126806561174
let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first ' environmental ' disaster , UNK disease , occurred in UNK in japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury .    2.6903640486369444
we should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity , but also from domestic activity .    2.544927749812827
i do not believe that UNK emissions at sea , and particularly in a closed environment like the mediterranean , when we want to clean up purification plants , is a good way to clean up water .    2.8848985363764608
we should pay particular attention to UNK pollution , to development , to the urbanisation of coastal areas , etc . but we should also think about restoring the environment and , for example , solving the problems associated with UNK UNK , and the areas of UNK that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected .    3.6253291553563898
they say that if you want something done , it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea , the fishermen , must be very attentive .    3.3393129799676955
it will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40 % , as proposed by the commission , has been very greatly watered down by the council , to between 5 and 10 % .    2.9774644727288284
it will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and , together with my colleague , UNK UNK , who is also a former member of the european parliament , we would request a moratorium on the use of deep - sea trawlers in community waters in the bay of biscay , to the south of the UNK parallel north , because we have had enough of seeing UNK being washed up and dying on our beaches , particularly at the moment .    3.1467406439641183
so we must practise selective fishing .    2.4927759228893573
aquaculture should also be monitored .    3.5387214589241967
read mr katiforis ' s report again , in which he says that in scotland , for example , 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that i just mentioned , and impact upon the environment .    2.7380098378408695
let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment .    2.42682586795223
the council of europe is coming before the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy on 22 march to speak about the research work that must be undertaken , particularly in the marine environment and , more precisely , the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans .    2.616761004120567
ladies and gentlemen , i would ask you to come and take part in this discussion .    3.2219644393763396
mr president , the katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals , notably , of the europe for a union of nations group , which were adopted in the committee on fisheries and , in my opinion , this version is an improvement on the original .    3.4216872503866154
i would like to touch briefly on these amendments .    2.4370935873059625
with regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems , we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible , although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them , of course , as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make , and also in view of the fact that , in any case , satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels .    2.619119372680944
we welcome the report ' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system , as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the member states .    3.05291289332159
moreover , with regard to the protection of coastal areas , which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish , we hope for tighter controls , which , in our opinion , should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea .    3.2009711779549868
in effect , this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management .    2.550091946941838
more specifically , with regard to fisheries management in the mediterranean , we are all aware that fishing in the mediterranean is not governed by provisions on tacs .    3.247394256606444
and just as well , in my view .    3.7101688940607183
as you may be aware , in contrast with the cold northern seas , the mediterranean is a small , warm sea where there are very few , if any , schools of only one species of fish .    2.4865399695635415
in our opinion , the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting tacs in the mediterranean is therefore inappropriate .    2.8140065429971055
lastly , we would vote for the amendments tabled by the confederal group of the european united left .    3.201510034562697
we do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when UNK on fishing are in force : in short , we must make it possible to carry on a major , responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment .    2.6211844328547205
mr president , first of all , i am pleased that the katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment : pollution , UNK fishing , UNK platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of UNK damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore , and fishing is also a victim of this situation .    2.3641983770026687
there is therefore a need for an in - depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment .    3.0224664922195825
the use of selective fishing gear which reduces UNK unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential , as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore , as well as in coastal waters .    2.3233177950191495
a reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation .    2.2674554194278373
in addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene , the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors .    2.2535922131077135
moreover , it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface UNK of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly : in reality , in some cases , small - scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources .    3.0298128219664378
i am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources , and i also welcome the commission ' s request to propose the institution of a european UNK to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour , in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life .    2.9620593819538645
mr president , as a member of the verts / ale group , but also as a member of this parliament for galicia , i propose to use this intervention to enlarge upon two issues . i shall , of course , be brief .    2.9203195263399007
firstly , fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin .    2.518329154558858
shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living , for without it , the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed .    2.338041393001498
secondly , it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries .    2.4784827947367676
this particularly applies , however , to our own coastal waters .    3.2262846216036087
given this context , i would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago .    2.9372482780560674
i discovered that the eu is using erdf resources to finance the construction of a UNK in UNK , in galicia , for UNK chemical and hydrocarbon products , on a site which will only employ three workers . this contravenes the ec environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as UNK , where 26 000 people earn a living from the UNK industry .    2.7399216608901718
can i first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .    2.7186059033676164
conservation is something that i hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it .    2.6939449949611602
a lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep .    3.150781065582069
it is all very well to talk about conservation and i agree with it totally .    2.9019718442523774
but at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where , when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the european union .    2.4965810758891602
commissioner fischler , of course , knows me from a long time back and i have written to him on bse and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries i am going to have to UNK him on fisheries , along with his UNK colleagues , because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of northern ireland .    3.077343138734294
in actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any UNK , without any real negotiation or discussion .    2.5016114419673197
it has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period .    2.3205574983802593
now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks , but what i am really saying to you commissioner , and i have said this to you in the fisheries committee and i will say it to you again : there is a wide divide between brussels and the working fishermen .    3.1220676222912673
it does not matter whether you come from galicia , it does not matter whether you are from northern ireland or whether you are from scotland .    2.6363358039501255
that UNK exists and we in brussels have not been able to cross that divide .    2.881728040460036
and we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen .    3.063581661428929
we have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and i hope that you , as the commissioner responsible for fisheries , will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board .    2.7912393310662758
thank you very much , commissioner fischler .    1.953663089635656
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6891396379085435
bankruptcy procedures    3.85109742594731
the next item is the report a5 - UNK / 2000 by mr lechner , on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , on the initiative of the federal republic of germany and the republic of finland , with a view to the adoption of a council regulation on insolvency proceedings ( UNK / 1999 - c5 - 0069 / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cns ) .    2.32856335473037
mr president , i think we all agree that a european legal area must be created .    2.7964902217870717
we also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and , what is more , concepts .    2.6047147508010124
the very word bankruptcy , the legal concept of bankruptcy , does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the member states of the union .    2.696565784375004
we therefore all agree on the established facts , and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction .    2.9564337798770635
if i may , however , just make a few comments on the method .    3.3799065653157445
when you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts , and the fact that we wish to improve coordination , i believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed .    3.618947712089159
the first is to establish UNK , saying : in the final analysis , bankruptcy in france is the same thing as bankruptcy in england or in germany .    2.4286665695285143
the second way is to recreate a law ex UNK , that is to say , to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the member states .    2.368505683413895
that is not the route that has been taken .    3.336764577259105
the third route that has been taken is in the end to UNK above the existing systems , which are not touched , a real UNK of community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty .    2.9564488723254296
this is a good thing , moreover , and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for .    2.7625965161558956
but at this stage i should like to make an observation , which is not technical , but more philosophical and taken from practice .    3.1994466556819607
it is that bankruptcy is experienced within the european union , in the majority of states , as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects .    3.0344207669205034
and i believe that it is our responsibility , in an ever more rapidly moving economy , where everyone must have a real opportunity , to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise , and a second and a third chance , if necessary .    2.865261643000703
one of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between the european area , for example and the united states , is precisely this ability of UNK back that exists on the other side of the atlantic and that we just do not have here .    3.3441524956913846
i believe that since we have gone that far and we are continuing along that path , which is the route of creating a collective procedure for regulating this type of legal standard in the european union , we should bear in mind that it should not become the allegorical figure of the UNK .    3.0932307428670938
mr president , commissioner , i believe , in fact , that it is more by luck than skill that there have not so far been any disasters due to the absence of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers .    3.200673435238843
when we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market , we must also deal with the darker side , namely bankruptcies .    3.488318574797662
i consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard .    3.3885757976966855
i am , moreover , proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the council .    2.6970171469452886
i think it is an important step we are taking , even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it .    3.1049471740047205
to the rapporteur ' s regret , i must unfortunately point out that our group cannot support amendment no 3 because we consider that it restricts UNK ' legal position and UNK their legal protection .    2.8911599994318835
with regard to amendment no 6 , we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee . i am a little surprised that you in the group of the party of european socialists did not support it then .    2.6912082284902037
we shall now support your amendment no 6 , but i wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee .    2.7072230527891468
i also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are UNK and best in the various countries .    3.272146438074961
. ( pt ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , the commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 convention on insolvency proceedings .    2.5703794600443253
as you all know , this convention was the result of many years of discussion , which was often difficult and often laborious , and that for this very reason , it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles , that is to say , the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our member states .    2.8857448793286884
because we are aware that the developing global economic situation , and particularly the single market , can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings , which often take the form of cross - border proceedings , the union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles , thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly .    2.7507424977372104
for better or for worse , the fact that businesses become UNK will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life .    2.3721387576733437
it will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business , which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the UNK of businesses that are no longer viable .    2.5596273496526596
this is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy .    2.762575208493855
it was not the commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two member states , germany and finland , by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which member states share with the commission on such issues .    3.449900308962024
the commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the convention .    2.8024343836813164
as far back as 1981 , the commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings .    3.0692902269153666
furthermore , this view was accepted in the commission ' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses .    2.6151436757802093
the 1995 convention , on the other hand , authorises the filing of secondary proceedings , thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the commission would like to see accepted .    2.9404879444360454
following the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam , the commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted , one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings .    3.085688895953784
nevertheless , i do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 convention which was , moreover , based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years .    2.793137192999703
consequently , the commission has refrained from presenting an amendment . instead , it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues .    2.634237242635588
the commission feels , for this reason too , that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation , but i would nevertheless like to convey to you the commission ' s opinions on the amendments under discussion .    3.272572781033043
the commission therefore accepts amendments nos 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur , mr lechner .    2.7991280008593624
on the other hand , it does not accept amendment no 4 .    2.705071588150916
indeed , the commission feels that parliament should instead support amendment no 4 by the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the commission , assisted by a regulatory committee , in accordance with the on - going procedure of article 5 of decision 1999 / 468 / ec .    2.7290019489840356
therefore , with regard to the amendments proposed by the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , the commission accepts amendments nos 3 and 4 . on the other hand , it does not accept amendments nos 1 and 2 , on the idea of " centre of the UNK ' s main interests " .    3.5300240378255663
with regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person , this idea is clearly defined in article 3 .    2.4069113972224656
thank you very much , commissioner vitorino .    2.2132856069998006
the debate is closed .    1.8023713445627845
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6891396379085435
( the sitting was suspended at 12 . 05 a . m . )    2.128219464590397
shipwreck of the erika    4.056515615441046
the next item is the oral question ( b5 - 0011 / 2000 ) by mr varela suanzes - carpegna , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , to the commission , on the shipwreck of the erika .    2.7186767199704494
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly i want to warmly thank mr fischler for being here today .    2.3047148369733037
our president told us yesterday that the commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments .    2.4164739950575074
he must have reconsidered and , in so doing , has , as usual , shown great respect for this house . i thank him for this .    2.9843674602681256
on behalf of the committee on fisheries , i must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker erika .    2.842045011909585
there are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue .    2.4199576576785327
firstly , we must show the commission , the council and the member states that this house cannot and will not forget about this serious incident .    3.9236495985158157
secondly , we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster , namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions .    2.533929329934209
the UNK to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future .    2.6136835242655367
enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event .    2.4257693688313684
we must now get down to adopting measures , commissioner .    2.555905643374445
firstly , efficient controls are needed in community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport , particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved .    2.373904101319371
the construction of these vessels , the use of double hulls , their age , their control by classification companies , insurance , the creation of databases containing all relevant information , community cooperation and coordination , the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled . who better than the european commission to make serious proposals for european harmonisation in these areas ?    2.253589027454381
flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport , particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling ' responsible fisheries ' .    2.7729892224354784
access into community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet community safety standards must be controlled .    2.260418530718868
we expect concrete action from the european commission . the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of brittany and the vendée are particularly important , well - developed and prestigious .    2.4900995147020977
the european commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage . it must also indicate all the specific measures , including political , economic , social and financial measures , which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected UNK .    2.6986924284811384
how can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained ?    2.360107178289965
how can those affected be compensated ?    2.4595535778759436
this is a very serious problem which the european union , as an economic , commercial , industrial and fishing power , must tackle .    2.98969321476207
we must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and UNK .    2.6059484900768575
we must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future .    2.46116787752358
this is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the committee on fisheries .    3.292720714415806
we hope to hear specific proposals from the commission , with plenty of action and no more regrets .    2.84738777562427
this house will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups .    2.597749869596436
mr president , the shipwreck of the erika off the coast of brittany on 12 december caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years .    2.314197625765528
in addition to destroying natural resources , this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors , particularly those dependent on fisheries .    2.388796717993001
with 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the UNK vessel , the situation could still deteriorate .    2.664838578871896
the consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming UNK . these consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself .    2.158303907885845
the regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance . they have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which , unfortunately , is not an isolated event .    2.6720304302148925
the main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature , which is nowadays too often being punished by man ' s activities .    2.365860819948445
these events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities .    2.571154647841412
prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes .    2.4989021158627067
mr fischler says that he always comes to the house when asked .    2.7465545170304946
yet on the issue of the erika he has given the impression , perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of brittany and the vendée , that , as the fisheries commissioner , he is not always available or , at best , available only on a part - time basis .    2.7820956787082007
as this house indicated in its first resolution on 20 january , the needs of the severely affected fisheries , ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account .    2.16561226519012
we therefore now call upon the commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds .    3.020181417879812
galicia and brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks .    2.2424296641136756
we cannot understand how it is that experiences like the urquiola or amoco cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience .    2.383676985137009
please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this .    2.503830748683163
we must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen .    1.9767153399539796
the polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate .    2.6778888184568244
it is time that polluters started to pay because , up to now , it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid , and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well .    2.4949207624272276
i am therefore delighted at mr fischler ' s response , particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted .    2.6769494707435637
on behalf of the pse group , i want to send a message of solidarity to those affected , to the fishermen , farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market .    2.8308861682278046
my message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians , to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support .    2.6599954881557277
i wish to put two questions to the commissioner .    3.2282220326578837
parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable .    2.6221093533144795
the question for the commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people .    2.485013491837647
the second point relates to the future and the publication of the commission ' s white paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce european environmental legislation properly .    3.0980374796217607
it is recognised in that white paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified , where the damage can be quantified and where a clear UNK connection can be made between the two .    2.2444721213179304
the erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that white paper is seeking to address .    2.06561500934346
this question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future .    3.194047798641609
the proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by eu - regulated dangerous activities and my concern , and perhaps the commissioner can deal with this , is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of erika in future . will it really address the concern or will , in practice , in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas , the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause .    2.72447561263903
mr president , our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster , but good intentions are not enough , there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment .    2.482235488613818
we are pleased to hear the commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation , and for this to be UNK .    3.1160489132646463
we also deplore the excessively UNK application of vessel inspection , and we are in favour of creating a european coast guard authority , and also , in particular , of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory .    2.9634024262516143
we further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats .    2.813529086656383
finally , we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely UNK , with a UNK hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million .    2.634990180541333
this means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products .    2.20892045020841
this is not acceptable . we only found out too late and , as a result , medical inspection must be provided , paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment .    2.5245143624307236
finally , we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks , as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage .    2.8394496630777613
a great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation .    3.005533273512762
solutions cannot be found at the last minute , when the disaster is already in progress .    2.9793537369550847
consequently , the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand .    2.688415510631561
mr president , over two months after the wreck of the erika , pollution of the coasts , which have already been cleaned once , is still continuing .    2.5398440906415978
while reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this , i should like to salute the dedication of the workers , professionals and volunteers , who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches .    2.8069613159796902
thanks to the grass - roots involvement , which this house UNK by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 january , an initial raft of measures has been announced .    2.3103056381827622
the french government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety , particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection .    2.3234093337050385
the lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full , and decisions must be taken speedily at community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or UNK in our ports , to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants , and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection .    2.3161891973772897
so , yes , total fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological , economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster .    2.657533373661544
the french state has released funds for compensating damage .    2.2685619432365054
i feel , however , that the european union has so far not actually come up with any expression of community solidarity at the requisite level .    3.03873831548517
so , yes , appropriations must be released at community level to support the cleaning of the contaminated coastlines , to assist the organisations which went into action to save oil - covered birds , and to contribute towards getting the affected businesses back on their feet .    2.243173263808872
specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence .    2.269274261545681
i was pleased to hear the statement which commissioner fischler has just made , and i take careful note of the commitments he made before this house .    2.94001464029424
i should also like to say that my group shall remain vigilant and committed , in collaboration with the grass - roots action groups , to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level , supported by realistic penalties in the event of non - compliance .    2.335928421282289
mr president , the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick , two and a half months after the wreck of the erika , is because the extent of the economic , social and ecological disaster affecting our atlantic coastline is , in fact , far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand .    2.908803613227776
UNK of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the atlantic coastline on a daily basis .    2.110150631089684
curiously , the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified .    2.6981263126920783
the ecological disaster is a major one , possibly unprecedented in scale .    2.5214092908198342
large - scale degassing UNK and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution .    2.2689837895343157
all workers in the fishing , fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard .    2.760483731505325
the chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in europe .    2.127893861585857
the UNK victims are the producers or freight UNK banned in the vendée and loire - atlantique regions .    1.9877127951491893
as regards fishing proper , passive gear fishing is currently the UNK hit .    2.174140028723582
after shellfish , the slump is now affecting UNK sales .    2.1566580684564567
the many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and , above all , the future of fishery products , an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years , now UNK entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs , unfortunately , of initial UNK .    2.486318749578291
