although , as you will have seen , the UNK ' millennium UNK ' failed to materialise , still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful .    138.3663568658555
the UNK report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before parliament on thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .    216.9275088567969
i want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something i can competently do on thursday .    101.52446942192526
but , madam president , my personal request has not been met .    37.129997503792055
i shall also refer the matter to the college of quaestors , and i am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on .    67.64438169111976
i would also like to point out , madam president , that this parliament voted to express its confidence in president prodi during the previous legislature . it did so again during this legislature , in july , and then , in september , it voted once more to approve the whole commission .    79.73924523674377
according to its president , it is in a position to do so .    9.226580284844495
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this ?    11.441890069158099
it is not a lot to ask .    17.097988408965616
all the same , we must not content ourselves with enacting european law to ensure greater safety .    47.32343186544797
transport safety has sadly been in the news recently : the paddington rail crash in london , the terrible rail crash in norway , the two UNK UNK involving eu citizens and the natural disaster involving the erika off brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified .    203.57817456007177
considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a commission proposal first made on 19 march 1998 , even though parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .    149.85452652722148
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0104 / 1999 ) by mr koch , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 94 / 55 / ec on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [ com ( 1999 ) 158 - c5 - 0004 / 1999 - 1999 / 0083 ( cod ) ] .    3.8091636504971955
it merely UNK transitional rules by postponing deadlines , deletes provisions which are no longer applicable , and lays down the procedures for a ) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b ) enacting less stringent national regulations , in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas .    201.7508452389525
the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the commission were laid down UNK in the council decision of june 1999 .    35.35961666470757
the commission ' s proposal , however , does not take account of all the facts , such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions .    31.467199404588715
we hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment .    109.07271870464307
it was because of the UNK policies of his own conservative party .    48.10733410727145
projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be made more productive .    37.807924158218654
while the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the union ' s regional policy in general .    43.3976721960752
bearing this in mind , this house should , in any event , demand that , before the community support frameworks for the period in question are approved , they be studied and submitted for debate in this parliament , specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today .    93.16654502808234
i do not think , however , that this report has come too late .    15.42319266640266
they need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .    82.73728870246096
this is what we are today asking the commissioner for .    30.87687542354556
the social fund has certainly improved our third - level institutions , financed our post - leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long - term unemployment , assist early school UNK and promote higher standards of UNK UNK .    89.25501031141958
this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves . this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that i have been a member of this parliament , and i have raised the issue time and time again .    46.63079498695635
the commission , however , though bound to issue guidelines , does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner .    114.19878854402275
to this end , europe as a whole , and each member state individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the structural funds .    86.83722703194408
mr president , mrs schroedter ' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations , and i would like to congratulate her on that .    28.099901447818244
when i speak of optimum utilisation , i am referring both to the national and regional levels .    34.102923367208476
here in this chamber , ladies and gentlemen , among you , i wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - mr hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as member states are concerned , your observations will certainly be taken into consideration .    62.34768020089973
you then mentioned , mrs schroedter , the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development , pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration .    96.7754788312049
at this stage , i would simply like to say that i would like to see it integrated into the programming for objective 2 rural areas , in the way that the eaggf guidance section is for objective 1 regions .    35.51689128900866
social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union    14.136375867317115
the negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the european regions ' gdp and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment .    124.15200121987513
we now require an in - depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .    72.2141078071148
the member states must also bear in mind their responsibility .    16.82821522423469
we have a serious situation in which in the european union today , there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached , on average , 23 . 7 % in the regions worst affected , regions which also happen to be poor areas , whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment , corresponding to the richer areas , unemployment stands at just 4 % .    181.28088399797986
after all , the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment UNK the fact than an increase of at least 3 % in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all .    257.46316589713774
in other words , what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there .    62.04435912697738
mr president , my compliments to the rapporteur for his in - depth report .    10.73525865808727
the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the european union .    24.751190626830308
genuine structural reforms and a competition - friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base .    124.72193307335887
people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a UNK .    83.05842552106765
regarding this problem of partnership , i shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations are applied properly .    65.15944319165169
you will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike .    76.03370008073627
i hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which i believe was founded on a UNK as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions .    121.99099986038424
we will also pass this on to our services , however .    35.255290232727596
the commission is the executive and parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role , for the sake of its own independence ; but parliament is a supervisory body , and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one ' s decisions than a democratically - elected parliament , indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion ?    267.9238330156138
to put it plainly , the level of state aid declared , roughly speaking , is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1 . 2 % of community gdp or more or less the equivalent , UNK , of the community budget for one year .    143.61702223050634
this clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the cohesion fund , among other things , which come at the top of the list .    46.825263831103584
this being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .    15.675346381677778
the rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 december 1996 .    103.03342122755907
as far as parliament is concerned , it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired .    50.86093542473667
no one wants an UNK subsidy competition in europe .    31.49935608134176
the internal market is the basis for our work .    9.42802180382088
i would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs mr von wogau , mr langen , mr rapkay and mr jonckheer , as well as the commission , for their excellent cooperation .    37.70347054326837
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .    17.8009051828394
my second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although i am not going to talk about market failure just now .    39.31569662678462
human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equation .    49.05577408877052
we want a true culture of competition in europe .    22.84832273092576
i want to thank you , commissioner monti , for your outstanding cooperation and i want to tell you that , as we enter the new millennium , you have an especially important role .    32.5867323075505
the competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .    24.818905035347907
a system , such as the current one , which is capable of making so few decisions , be they approvals or UNK , is something less than a valid system .    177.58586665291568
a reform of this point was therefore also necessary .    74.07093247424369
the court of justice accepted some time ago that community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the member states and in 1994 , the commission published a communication on this subject .    60.08658295489011
as a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreements are anti - competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market .    70.79825217540271
for these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .    9.957753766184137
in that event we would not have moved forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the union .    64.7610098860447
we find that the european court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with france at the moment , in which we have the support of the commission .    63.343202607865
we have been told how , currently , people ' s time is being wasted and that the changes , therefore , could be beneficial .    161.5836271192636
mr president , commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .    12.428966989699488
the commission ' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow - up supervision of the national authorities and member states ' courts .    88.23973643293985
but if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a UNK UNK of competition policy .    38.110293390988
mr president , commissioner , director - general , i would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von wogau report : i welcome the commission ' s open - minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules , and to propose practical reform measures .    80.64659237042088
the white paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection , discussion , and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves , the judiciary , the member states , and above all the smes concerned , that need to be clarified .    82.23056353556385
i also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the commission giving up any of its responsibility .    67.40510068621045
mr president , commissioner monti , there is much that is good in mr jonckheer ' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors .    13.595113572463891
aid that is based on the self - seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages , thus UNK competition and leading to an ineffective , UNK division of europe ' s meagre resources .    380.1057382943787
mr rapkay ' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .    56.98590204253328
the economies are growing , we are enlarging to 25 - 30 member states .    91.30327417915619
this is therefore an aspect to be considered .    23.99822149788781
the groups are : the efficiency of the rules , the risk of renationalisation , consistent application of the rules and legal certainty . i will take these very quickly one at a time .    89.8046434645509
as with many other provisions of the treaty , articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 have , after all , been applied for decades by national authorities and judges , and i do not feel that this has created serious problems .    53.48058414940495
the commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provisions and through its decision - making practice .    55.53418655119398
we are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for smes .    29.125630886135593
i am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey , which , according to the scheduled timeframe , should be being drawn up by the staff now , in january , and for adoption by the commission in march 2000 , to see whether the latest trends are confirmed .    150.6410233359608
i can only say very briefly , that we are actively working with them on a practical level : they are making preparations , they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities .    109.62788546610977
the concerns of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , as UNK in its position , together with those of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , will also be taken full account of in this process .    16.62208853998733
we need to take this responsibility seriously .    15.132203938344762
in any case , this idea must be encouraged , and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a community corpus iuris in the treaties .    70.60108474233955
on behalf of my group , but also personally , i hope that the vital financial spirit of the union will pave the way for the creation of a european legal system which respects citizens ' rights and guarantees , which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto UNK in many states .    68.79291302789719
at the moment , article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used .    76.65229425389897
the tampere summit was about combating crime .    25.457016554618413
this is exactly the task which a small , limited , european public prosecutor ' s office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosecution stage .    88.22505385204755
parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .    64.58887681184945
there is as yet no federal european tax .    32.19383907902899
some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation .    78.10164429237113
this professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation , regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport .    195.40096905114657
i therefore wonder whether the community should not have a more drastic change of tack and , based on very strict evaluations , change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively .    78.22770578722692
i believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision - making process for the spending of european structural funds .    31.771567381192746
it is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the european social model , which we are all in favour of , and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .    27.81383956610315
- this report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid UNK out by some member states .    58.77925857891574
although i wholeheartedly support this aim , i would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .    104.38529423105118
i must also stress that once again the commission is , in fact , UNK the issue of practical action on equal opportunities .    36.770959021682295
since the report of the committee on economic and monetary affairs did not go far enough in this respect , i abstained .    21.430247052854916
but at the same time , one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended .    82.47949935208702
this is UNK most of all in social terms .    30.929007518477764
the aid which union member states allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of eur 95 billion in the period 1995 - 1997 , including 40 % allocated to the manufacturing sector .    131.92894390724481
this is why i should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries .    68.07371300805968
it is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure .    48.63177382856122
although the steel aid code is expressed in a very clear way , the commission has , on a number of occasions , authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code .    23.5781280433421
mr president , commissioner , i have brought you a small gift . here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the french island of UNK who wrote to me as follows : " with every tide , the UNK is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the erika .    107.65280132148781
why , in these circumstances , is the liability of total as charterer not recognised ?    107.52819677286817
finally , a UNK thought for all the volunteers , nature lovers and bird lovers , who UNK and UNK are coming through to the aid of the oil - covered birds , organising rescue operation with the means available .    140.80006137881546
next , we have flags of convenience .    16.4082265537551
admittedly , there is the international oil pollution compensation fund , UNK , but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be reviewed .    79.95807478952737
if we do not obtain a framework of community regulations which is sufficiently clear , strict and trenchant , then those member states that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory , in the same way that the united states succeeded in learning the lessons of the exxon valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters .    177.10006213242258
twenty one years after amoco cadiz , this umpteenth oil slick , the seventh since 1967 , shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers .    157.77621338587846
the erika , a vessel flying a maltese flag , a UNK rust UNK , classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers , has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline , a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the amoco cadiz .    158.7886782519684
this would be a minimum requirement , i believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .    30.464638880461425
many thanks for this .    17.405645807349032
i would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports .    70.12014613244958
we have now obtained a first - rate UNK of a variety of measures .    57.542778931558196
they accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks , even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions .    114.65842660213909
i cannot accept this .    3.42539424486364
the erika was built at a japanese UNK and is single - hulled .    50.38296663395453
in my opinion , the european union can only accept malta if it is guaranteed that the maltese flag will sail without an accident in future .    66.03772750307196
furthermore , i will not withhold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow meps , to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of european and international cooperation .    70.77770887006425
in europe , after the amoco cadiz , or the urquiola on the spanish coast , in 1976 , or the torrey canyon , in the same year , or the many other cases there have been , we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995 , particularly in the last few years .    112.0954775554755
this will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the european union , and to deal with the notorious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a community register .    164.84134672083945
according to the information which the commission services have given me , this legislation is not adequately applied in many member states due to a lack of personnel , means and inspectors .    130.1590598991356
i will not expand further . we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions .    24.30154045222657
we know full well that what you are doing , commissioner , and that is , limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the structural funds of the new objective 2 or from the provisional objectives 2 or 5b .    85.5726686252426
we must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the white paper for renewable energy sources , as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases .    88.14913738500161
the commission in brussels responded to the victims ' UNK for help with a UNK of shoulders .    92.78814764694552
i urge the commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms .    32.872291049298795
we are fortunate in having the gulf stream .    27.518261274399404
ladies and gentlemen , none of us must forget what has taken place .    34.891032914896094
it is also true that there is a lot of european money around . commissioner barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development , forestry would be eligible under article 33 , companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in article 87 ( 2 ) of the treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the structural funds .    95.3312272142754
what we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible .    10.73351158508944
we had high winds and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of UNK being UNK , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water .    139.77162749304043
at my hearing last september , i promised speedy delivery of this white paper .    69.61268955581677
the white paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new commission was appointed last september .    56.85968425336586
the commission will need the full support of parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule .    46.611674607286645
i am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened .    39.23238230028504
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the eu , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in member states .    68.79630211390597
i will be very interested to hear the views of parliament itself in relation to this matter .    26.495673068163224
in addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .    18.472509049667845
this is an issue which i expect will be discussed between parliament and the commission over the next few weeks and months .    21.9537364617319
as you can see , half - an - hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .    103.21443907482157
it acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency .    47.649024939067466
at the same time , it also wishes to acquire UNK type reactors from canada , which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in pakistan and india .    88.02839253952754
when it comes to medical checks and so on , i do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer .    39.57846461781117
subject : appointment of a european union envoy for tibet in 1998 the tibetan government in exile received over UNK tibetans who escaped over the UNK mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb .    249.83120866637108
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.497982116609854
your approach , which i am very much in favour of , since it is a coherent one , takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights ; i wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights .    58.50462338907894
if we cut down here and say that the council now shares responsibility for this , then i fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve .    48.01091188734408
some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .    40.418387885463055
however , it goes without saying that the commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the european parliament on all aspects of administrative reform .    49.81533881865092
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner .    2.838060465513616
however , i would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997 .    38.23142663613205
questions to mr nielson , who is replaced by mr patten    116.55328862308453
this must naturally lead to a UNK of development goals and strategies , together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women ' s and men ' s priorities and needs are better reflected .    219.79429937459878
that is naturally unacceptable .    14.128860469324843
he is absolutely right to say that a union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much UNK in the balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise , had we taken more pre - UNK measures if those had been possible .    160.5634709804302
do we have any figures ?    26.10415104523288
i should like to ask the commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the commission .    21.604279171612536
the member states , i . e . the national governments , have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies , submitting proposals , selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control .    63.68334442537274
they are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation , where almost none exists .    68.43078506996241
the european commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and , in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these persons .    79.89348972859115
it would be interesting to hear whether the commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have UNK , so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them .    154.65728717938964
there are therefore two possible solutions : either the directive is inapplicable in denmark , or denmark is required by the directive to introduce universally applicable agreements .    70.97542778747771
if not , will it explain how the directive is to be complied with in this area ?    28.64307990691456
the deadline by which it had to answer the commission ' s questions expired on 6 december 1999 and we have not received a reply .    52.359512421014365
as far as your question is concerned , this problem does not only apply to denmark . it is not only denmark which has matters pending .    69.0397889304737
this is in place too .    17.585488163156704
we want more than that , however .    18.057181116258896
ultimately , we also need to achieve better cooperation , of course , between the european court of auditors and its national UNK .    44.615955789964055
even if we hear nothing else , we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see .    41.780482920208996
mr president , this time last year the european parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by mr UNK to investigate allegations of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the european commission .    71.48840761791475
the european institutions should follow the example of a number of countries , most notably the united kingdom , and institute a committee for standards in public life , with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the european institutions .    83.43317124294018
finally , the commission ' s human resource policy must be modernised .    15.85035891303412
a career with the european institutions must become more attractive .    50.639315046289354
commissioner kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform .    82.56371130167761
we believe the vast number of recommendations of the wise men ' s report should be implemented .    16.866006120309997
some of our working practices need radical reform .    14.698648631368076
is this possible ?    15.031542981302117
the second report of the wise men arrived in september .    12.955101458863016
i would like to end on the following point . just as the white paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated , we would request the same in connection with the new white paper on the reform of the commission .    49.75559008305445
incomprehensibly , trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition , and i would not be surprised if union members were already members of olaf , thereby placing this institution which should , at least formally , guarantee its impartiality , at great risk .    222.48724375970215
what we really need to focus on , however , is making the checks more effective .    28.286955680931065
that is the position which a clear majority of the committee on budgetary control UNK to .    31.802285788862427
and i would also say this to you , commissioner : please , deliver the beef even if it is british .    91.52486888488308
stand firm on the demand for mobility , not as a right , as it says here in the report , but as a management tool .    112.99086377426136
we have not done this so far , and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing .    45.57501320513138
i would also point out that our coordinator on the budgetary control committee is mr UNK ruiz , who is spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a spanish perspective .    86.0919247656486
a very important proposal indeed .    16.71821277410336
i am not going to mention the length of this report .    16.4202352872671
turning to the main themes of the resolution i offer the following observations .    44.005488355797326
in addition , and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system , the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - " the second key " as herr bösch said , established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the committee of experts .    93.53313045655047
i can also specifically assure the house that we are not going for what is sometimes called " a big UNK approach " .    70.68204650545572
i am persuaded , however , by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability .    150.10597151095757
this will be taken a step further with a proposal in june for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life .    41.66780225738434
the point was very properly raised by mr elles and referred to by mrs thors .    101.59579973497289
a series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months .    34.86623021459526
parliament has frequently made that point .    15.954942657157975
similarly , despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the framework agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid - february deadline , i very much hope that the much more important september deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached .    182.15417400868796
the beginning of the talks with syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in moscow at the end of the month .    115.76317465058558
syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a UNK to a peace economy .    210.33341855929
lastly , but maybe most importantly , we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas , bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems .    97.57933331372983
i repeat that a change in the politics of the middle east will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide . i hope i can add that we will want to provide that .    100.65252922878433
i hope the house will understand that .    27.968770277296827
the tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a UNK view of the situation .    85.01769302413828
in my judgement , this constitutes a guarantee to both sides , both from a political and a financial point of view , of the commitment they can expect from the european union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for .    79.76587853707063
as things are at present , the golan heights account for between a third and a sixth of israel ' s water supply .    63.07819701295104
the recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the middle east .    24.53328300289845
i refer principally to the palestine - israel question , but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the golan since 1967 and in southern lebanon since 1982 .    176.27664083142398
the fact that the syrian foreign minister and the israeli prime minister were recently sitting around the same table in america for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and UNK can be overcome .    111.37797840209552
i sincerely hope that , in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the middle east , all the key protagonists will move forward quickly , in the very near future , so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved .    37.90393058393997
surely assad would be barak ' s ideal negotiating partner and not the foreign affairs minister .    147.38392267555764
all the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater european involvement in the peace process .    46.85642379171133
mr president , commissioner patten , the recent peace talks begun in the usa between israel and syria mark a turning point in the history of the middle east . it has taken fifty years to reach this point , which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations .    88.11644029297027
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as i do not have a background as a member of the european parliament , you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague fernando gomes .    37.420224497788496
i believe that in this context , and in the context of the dialogue that the council and parliament will have to establish on the future of europol and eurojust , it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the council and parliament with regard to europol .    24.816554531182533
for this reason , 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the eu ' s institutions respond to our citizens ' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement , with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection .    94.6060215380824
i hope that in conjunction with the portuguese presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , which is also the political message of tampere , and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies .    97.42787744871212
we hope that we can count on the support of parliament , and - why not say it - of the council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives , so that the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible , thus allowing us all to contribute , in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , to the realisation of this project , which is , without a doubt , the " UNK in the crown " of the treaty of amsterdam .    60.55196805029873
the tampere summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular .    23.925494028285648
answers are still awaited .    111.36261214665741
since tampere , there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent .    152.57797772761552
care must be taken to ensure that the council complies with parliament ' s modus operandi .    153.23244002233122
the portuguese presidency must put an end to this type of UNK behaviour .    14.534894332219581
the commission has proposed creating a european fund for refugees to which parliament was favourably disposed .    103.49908688425022
behind this lies another ambition on the part of the commission and of the council and of the overwhelming majority of this house , namely to introduce such an area .    73.4780972917169
a system of this kind is not something the eu can introduce without society ' s sustaining damage as a result .    41.32642638239632
the agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen .    20.865306438229712
let us stop the shadow - UNK . let us drop the elaborate UNK and let us respect the duties that the treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate .    176.08976623232064
the total lack of progress in european citizenship and the political rights of all european residents is to be regretted .    156.6341240645963
i lodged a written complaint on the same subject to commissioner vitorino on 23 december .    82.03759571438661
without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made , we , the european parliament , would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the council to implement these decisions in many areas , as well as its lack of common vision and , in particular , the lack of transparency and cooperation with the european parliament .    45.403299514140336
but i want to add a word of caution .    46.607519054542756
but we must look always to subsidiarity .    27.032980193755467
i do not consider that the council tried to answer my question .    20.143408319145742
does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the european union referred to there ?    144.77051338557513
it is obvious that transparency will be a permanent UNK on the european agenda and it will , of course , feature on the agenda of this intergovernmental conference .    70.58028024388877
have the council of fisheries ministers and the commission assessed the impact of UNK the portuguese quota for ices zones xi and UNK and UNK zone 34 . 1 . 1 to france ( UNK metric tonnes per year overfishing ) on the ices zone viii anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future ?    256.12869879755516
i understand that portugal is affected by this .    31.092064457813297
the court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to spain in zone viii had been maintained at 90 % and france ' s at 10 % .    94.48958333077056
in the light of the above , will the council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of kosovo , as requested by parliament ?    43.146581354971495
we have fully supported the efforts of the united nations mission and the international security forces in kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat .    111.63423162130726
nevertheless , mr alavanos , the council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in kosovo does not match the desired amount , in terms of what the various member states have been able to raise , and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground .    58.54578207828245
i know that this is an extremely delicate issue , but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented .    64.85284800412336
it is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses , accidents and UNK mentioned by mr alavanos .    76.44709029159002
we think that the role of food safety , specifically in terms of everything linked to public health , is one of our presidency ' s essential tasks . it is therefore one of the priorities of our programme .    60.505388639458616
i would like an answer as to whether or not the portuguese presidency intends to do something about these matters .    26.990039795047082
we therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long - term strategies , regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term , some of the homeless may be dead , will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the european union .    52.78030281112957
i hope that the minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue .    39.53937555931106
unless we wish to act like UNK , we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face , particularly in the area of external relations .    95.86295997001018
my question , which has not been answered , is why , when the european parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the european union , the council and the commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether .    66.75666547220737
we thank mr seixas da costa , but he can also write his letter to the three kings .    17.603460931993588
the oral question ( b5 - UNK / 2000 ) by mr désir and others , to the commission , on the commission position on the idea of a capital tax .    7.04838113651204
between eur 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets . in three or four days , this can equal the total figure of annual global production , or global gdp , of approximately eur 6 000 billion .    170.56095978294593
in view of this situation , renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by UNK tobin , winner of the nobel prize for economics , to create a tax on currency transactions . the rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments , but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation , thereby checking the multiplication of short - term transactions .    149.3088248675472
this question has been debated in several national parliaments of the eu .    22.113619966994502
the commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax , such as the tobin tax , as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation , so to speak .    54.19212868512647
so the tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate .    60.783012838719685
but the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability , as the commissioner has just so impressively told us , is the result of speculation .    85.69026622172356
in my view , and i say this quite clearly , the question is UNK motivated rather than solution - focused .    49.11746705058212
secondly , speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify .    34.38416541774739
we need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up .    102.18095428082128
we must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice .    50.83273206908847
madam president , we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted ; we must also mention the fact , commissioner , that 80 % of these huge , daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days .    102.66882734847654
the minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last , not only by the commission , but by reputable economic UNK throughout europe .    59.88321849671695
madam president , let us indeed tax money speculation : it does not produce anything new .    65.65781663369368
madam president , i can assure your parliament that my day - to - day work consists partly of attempting , in conjunction with my offices and colleagues , to completely integrate the financial markets within europe , thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible .    114.59260090536068
in my capacity as commissioner for the internal market , i am , in other words , opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions .    36.30108116184367
you could hardly expect this commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact , impede international economic movement .    87.901510454107
could you please draw his attention to the fact that i have something to say to him ?    63.3184938834401
i just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less .    35.564593551515635
please respect us as members of parliament who want to take our work seriously , and that includes the tobin tax !    113.18624377067621
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.7368371772405946
in any event , these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party UNK known as the austrian freedom party .    43.402499309617404
however , we already knew this .    25.478903426674194
i believe they gave him 28 % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government .    72.36393325216945
my reaction may come as a surprise when i say that i personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards austria in matters of respect for human rights , having a sense of responsibility for one ' s own past , and the stability of democracy .    198.98542224729715
when the talks between the spö and övp broke down , the socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the fpö for their support .    170.54247638470162
that is why we are indebted to the commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest .    45.234439913558326
( applause , heckling )    35.788537006862676
we keep reminding them about article 6 of the treaty .    17.720023559215896
i think that we have just had a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it .    65.44594245837962
we also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to UNK fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism .    158.3905340459983
in those circumstances , consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result .    45.40994630911658
i believe we can learn something from this .    13.708772260625718
the same applies to the commission and i would again like to thank commissioner barnier for his collaboration with the european parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us .    28.665443218099742
that it is what we are doing .    5.394481132816799
in those circumstances it would be UNK not to widen the agenda .    23.71960851248359
one part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the court .    48.32234616633188
another is for the union itself to sign up to the european convention .    31.843909877697985
how , though , is the union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now , i . e . before enlargement takes place ?    109.89167489433804
we deplore the fact that the commission , in its opinion of 26 january , limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised europe enlarging towards the east , a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions .    56.118044570455766
this is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of europe was clearly recognised , i . e . by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty .    81.79458708485434
i would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps UNK up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights .    121.51818343872424
mr president , there are days when i really cannot understand this parliament . it seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self - mutilation .    119.35847729201807
why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow , 3 february , as a matter of urgency , when we could wait , in a position of strength , until the opening of the strasbourg part - session on 14 february , and thus force an agenda that is complete , and therefore consistent , on the council .    79.51466261374959
hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly , in our resolution , that the agenda for the igc is not equal to the issues , since in our haste , with UNK naivety , we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda .    180.5744310269598
if there is a democratic deficit at the end of this igc , then i say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this .    57.65062054571995
a flexible eu which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries .    130.44619711967644
i am thinking of the contributions from mr bonde and mr sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively UNK but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist eu .    111.30069056045883
you can think what you like about mr haider , and i personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician , but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country ' s democratic process .    98.77827928809555
may i particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this parliament .    41.65298221846836
will we enlarge with or without deep reform ?    108.45639048609726
it will have to initiate these negotiations .    13.09719545490269
concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully .    153.29315621295672
cross - border services    8.685123600694789
it has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the european economy and to 5 million third - country nationals in the european union who are here as workers or on a self - employed basis .    106.32171838988607
indeed , it should be possible for a third - country subject who has legal status in a member state to be admitted to other member states too .    36.31112140212488
firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve , that is achieve in the real sense .    94.72384165069215
if i were to go to the other extreme , as few hurdles as possible that is , then i would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the member states would not sign up to this directive .    132.24351111978805
under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation , third country nationals wishing to move to the uk under the procedures described , will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another member state , thereby by - passing uk border controls .    127.73814951591575
so , up to now , their access to the entire territory of the union has not been regulated by community legislation .    61.403457388127535
in this respect , the commission supports amendment no 22 , as i have already mentioned .    12.029643645636387
the commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal .    18.612828979507356
as far as amendment no 15 on the definition of the term " self - employed " is concerned , the commission will , as i have already remarked , provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged .    119.17514943060041
it has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency .    82.50182978959349
both concern cases with decisions pending before the court of justice .    17.82643404700149
secondly , we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation .    49.81235618821578
it is not firm commitments that we need , just plain commitments would suffice , and we need to know what has actually been paid and , more especially , what has not been paid .    62.84356200781634
one could do so once or twice , but i feel that the un donors should contribute to this as well , for there is a very large hole , as yet UNK , that we are unable to fill .    95.22791150147899
i would like to say to mrs pack that i am in complete agreement with her when she says that the commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments .    72.7941813604984
for example , amendments nos 1 , 2 and 4 .    7.258078533852205
a second point which i would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance .    45.78041721527038
we have an important part to play in the community in the european union in this regard .    15.780932396554663
however , despite the fact that the volume is relatively small , it is nevertheless UNK important that there is a common desire throughout the community as a whole to support this type of action , which contributes to our genuine compliance with the kyoto commitments . this action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources , greater safety in our energy supplies and , in the case of save , to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy , thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set .    161.25952745528934
furthermore , behind these programmes , that is to say , the save programme , which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings , and the altener programme , which concerns renewable energy , there lies an extremely important technological challenge , which , from an economic point of view , may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the union as a whole .    69.42609707115605
nevertheless , we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to .    34.450791049824225
i believe that the fact that culture and , UNK , education and youth now fall within the same commissioner ' s remit , will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes , which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the european union .    83.0509682877435
and a fully - fledged europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully UNK its roots , highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well - known .    71.22103239041151
and , i say to madame reding , thank you for the support and the help you have given so far , keep up the good work , we are on your side .    118.58844071794456
youth , education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values , for giving the citizens confidence in the european union and making it credible in their eyes .    112.14207258290641
it is thanks , too , to parliament ' s action , preferring a number of small - scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens ' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale .    146.2756724880641
the new programme will , i am sure , in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency , efficiency and balance , prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures .    87.54375259457568
this means that we need a pressure instrument .    16.041767492815367
it has not , however , been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle .    91.97513023416634
in conclusion , let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still UNK our forests , lakes and UNK .    73.65398517076967
it is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50 / 50 compromise is included that this does not work .    80.12755911701895
these would , of course , be to the advantage of modern , progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms .    130.20309152533835
of course , we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby . we are here to build a europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive .    82.05163798422333
it is high time that we reached an agreement .    9.364972140807948
parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context .    44.752407036818354
i come , of course , from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in europe and in third countries .    104.77251662036718
i am opposed to making the car owners liable .    29.0571097839553
let us beware , too , of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application .    115.35298746426322
the proposals made by a few meps impact greatly on this system .    37.75946535395871
mr president , i hold mr florenz in high UNK .    36.15172624082394
the manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and / or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost .    66.5933263209595
i do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise .    32.543329874571064
if we do reduce it , we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste .    154.23760935555958
i would therefore recommend to members of parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers ' liability .    56.45036896563466
they have paid already .    18.597161016142383
the objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation .    79.47956522454362
if we UNK away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs , we will be creating a loophole : we will not have created a rational , clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order .    168.53179709274457
over the years , a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways .    37.96745926545972
in this parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment .    56.41534819177958
they would then determine their own prices .    31.181213085083154
we know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it , and there is no excuse for not taking action .    84.71278370168743
i believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment .    30.154510529070027
these concern , for example , the phasing - out of heavy metals , manufacturer ' s liability and the requirement for recycling .    36.47551971029107
amendments nos 13 , 28 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions .    50.245700632259535
( parliament adopted the resolution )    1.8715958712722098
report ( a5 - 0018 / 2000 ) by mr dimitrakopoulos and mr leinen , on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the convening of the intergovernmental conference ( 14094 / 1999 - c5 - 0341 / 1999 - 1999 / 0825 ( cns )    3.6492332897313555
joint motion for a resolution on the negotiations to form a government in austria    44.73207083267692
in response i shall say the same thing i said to mrs mcnally just now .    36.18936572530521
it is not a quota !    16.648205999905702
here , in my opinion , the labour market is also considerably UNK by the costs arising to these companies .    40.522905743435075
i am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of florenz , lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end - of - life vehicles .    34.41625663326562
the directive concerning end - of - life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation .    41.2675570994559
first of all , who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction ?    36.21873206182452
so let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these UNK of the UNK industry .    37.208151674743974
logically , in order to be given such a card , the employee must be legally resident in a member states and must be covered by a social security scheme .    147.71311821437988
if they yield , they are lost .    78.61130675276307
this is why i am voting against the report .    3.1298546070242357
we feel that at present the central issues about convening an intergovernmental conference to amend the treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda . they are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered , and more important than the controversy over the extent of parliament ' s participation in it .    127.4933303349997
the provisions of amsterdam are largely UNK and allowing more scope for opt - outs could weaken the eu at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other european legislation .    147.10931246493146
not only has he admired adolf hitler , praised the waffen ss , and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four roma , but also in carinthia has been a member of the regional government .    96.68391386662437
we warn that this coalition , if it is formed today , unacceptably UNK the extreme right , directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation , which bring us together in this european union .    126.02215665642701
these are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us .    31.84271045788635
the document is unfair both to austrian members of the european parliament , and to members of the austrian national parliament , and it smacks slightly of UNK and political interests , but also of business .    108.29261635403407
not only do these decisions conflict with the treaty and apportion to the institutions of the union more power than that to which they are entitled but , worst of all , their effect will be counter - productive .    116.67359578911662
europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events .    52.93528745205797
do not count on me to keep quiet , without doing or saying anything .    78.37697091098705
in reaching an agreement with jörg haider and his party , the austrian christian democrats would at a UNK be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching UNK for even greater electoral success .    165.7550984452302
- ( de ) i am making this statement on behalf of the csu .    34.51791839251333
for these reasons the csu european delegates are against this resolution .    28.63328369573371
the övp ( austrian people ' s party ) , whose presence at european level we have also come to take for granted , is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of UNK in austria .    91.79472861249673
including jörg haider ' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in europe , and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other union member states or in candidate countries .    158.34090970932766
the treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 member states .    23.18909681513706
the people of europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit , but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible .    98.11533272296946
if it is of any comfort to her , the irish have not got their channel yet either .    76.647294264631
thank you , mrs banotti , and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this .    19.80585975910611
president .    3.387883826146691
in view of the fact that no council representative is able to attend on wednesday evening , a number of groups - the group of the european people ' s party , the group of the party of european socialists , the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , the group of the greens / european free alliance , the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left - requested that the council statement on the cyprus question and mr brok ' s report on the pre - accession strategy for cyprus and malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus mr swoboda ' s report were brought forward in the agenda .    20.09181072120671
we consider the matter to be important enough for the commission to react swiftly to this situation , and i think that parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject .    38.38308768978807
madam president , with apologies to my friend , UNK barón crespo , i should like to speak against this proposal .    20.398114159030666
the leader community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom - up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs .    78.41164770389926
finally , i am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated , if you consider , in addition , that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous leader ii .    56.67330414824086
in the designation of local urban programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas .    113.86069965697398
we therefore have unstable communities which are UNK with crime , drug - dealing and UNK .    61.672790293184235
we would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development , whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself , and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes , included in objectives 1 and 2 , and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located .    94.915526038614
i would ask them the following questions : does your policy seek to UNK people ?    45.99197813113139
i am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible , the committee on employment and social affairs .    46.404190881181776
a good opportunity to discuss the results , good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost .    74.23313607200414
i would like to mention here again the urban report , in which the rapporteur , in the explanatory statements , has dealt UNK with the issue of the minimum sum of eur 500 per inhabitant as per the commission ' s guidelines .    75.60268966880211
according to my group , this is excellent if , as a result of this , deprivation within regions , towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved .    112.76845378582048
but UNK out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending .    62.634960469719296
a second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils .    79.52496725614574
i would therefore call on the commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that leader + programmes run smoothly .    49.68065019861985
we need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme .    21.881792953483078
mr president , i have a few very brief comments .    7.041730411089309
i , for my part , have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme , and i have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the european parliament devoting special attention to them .    83.64829184645687
this discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature .    172.4687332289154
a breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas , however .    65.98040853606733
one of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the leader programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned .    116.77205120579805
indeed , these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the union .    27.102335676050327
there must , of course , be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups .    31.369017470641776
this across - the - board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way .    65.63477840317958
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am not always proud of the UNK that goes on here in parliament , but the urban programme is one of the best examples of our work : it was created following an initiative in parliament .    59.49079139136722
in this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas ; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand .    68.58752683291041
such european training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the cap to make sound business decisions for the future .    150.1799697336727
secondly , to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres , within these old quarters of our cities .    72.9533407390563
these areas of our cities are often home to single - UNK families , elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity , and families facing difficulties ; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society .    199.95761338608776
some other points of agreement highlighted in mrs mccarthy ' s report , the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention , the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and , finally , the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes , on the basis of a real partnership .    149.45594697885724
having made these general observations , i should like to focus on your main comments with regard to interreg .    36.01153807539373
i am making a personal commitment to do so .    22.79167673561472
and as soon as these are published in the official journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit leader + programmes .    149.30212529666485
she could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti - nuclear demonstration in glasgow .    134.66890575592814
i am optimistic and quite UNK and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on equal .    83.03962205949011
we just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and i would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning .    59.56021483319848
madam president , i am UNK at mr corbett ' s reaction .    28.156606323415073
nevertheless , we definitely have to do more .    27.80832642114569
we are clearly , once again , returning to enlargement , which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security , peace and freedom .    39.83668202868523
we should remember that we , the european union , are a union of minorities : we are all a minority within europe .    39.116831158673676
i think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen .    21.885779432848842
globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world , which is becoming smaller and smaller , as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity .    193.10951004558615
we have taken almost eleven months - president prodi was nominated at the berlin summit in march last year - to establish a legislative programme . this is not entirely president prodi ' s fault .    98.2475204940953
we are recovering from a crisis . however , i believe that , in the future , it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next commission to UNK with the presentation of a legislative programme .    34.280984911662244
in this regard , madam president , i would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language .    17.528800953397585
i would like to remind you of one thing : it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the european union from here .    39.91649434807937
even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks , we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of europe to a much more challenging political perspective .    117.90990884370915
in the UNK of this commission and this parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south - eastern europe .    52.67045699213444
it would be very difficult for those who propose a ' yes ' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the irish people if we lose our right to have our UNK to the european commission .    76.64436242545449
undoubtedly , reform of the european council is also going to be included in this white paper on the governance of the european union which will be published this summer .    19.73166467477845
so , whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme , the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions , or rather a list of issues on the table . it does not , however , give us the impression that the commission is taking a clear position on any of these points , but that it is just doing the european commission ' s duty .    141.82711580637033
in this house , in the past , large - scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the commission , under its power of initiative , launched , not as experiments , but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress , but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the european union .    134.56017078111802
there was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease " unnecessary " activities .    164.26713473076265
we should be careful , though , mr prodi , because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous commission and backed this commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this commission - precisely because , first and foremost , the reform of the commission would bring consolidation , a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand .    133.7145483077897
the reform is important but , if it aggravates the situation , reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the commission , then the structure of european integration , as planned by the founding fathers for the european commission , will be at risk .    126.49079218325546
the same goes for enlargement as an end in itself , without it being linked to a reform to make the european union and its structures much more efficient , and to proposals that the commission could have made at the igc .    59.57090052455294
the legislative programme from the commission ought at least , therefore , to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the member states and to the processes of popular democracy . otherwise , the number of laws produced in brussels will just keep on growing .    244.94407923200856
nonetheless , i agree with you , mr president of the commission , that many more steps to strengthen the european union will be needed in the future because the european union is not strong enough either to master the huge , inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which , to put it UNK , have an ambivalent attitude towards european values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent .    75.81478678951703
enlargement - and UNK UNK has been repeating this for ten years in this house - must not mean dilution , that is , it must not entail more risks .    132.37609806005443
my padanian electorate who , thanks to mr prodi , have already paid what in italy is known as the european tax - UNK only in part - have absolutely no intention , thanks once again to mr prodi , of paying another tax for someone else .    205.26182876925188
does " the european integration model as a rich source for global administration " imply the export of a large - scale perspective and concentration of power ?    234.00602696415595
it is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross - border issues and stopped UNK out the european cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities .    66.67352118500892
that also applies to the inclusion of the civil society , which is a welcome step .    31.868904473157443
not only the commission , not only the european parliament but also the people and the states in our european union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together .    67.74492526938886
( applause )    2.1767992217383143
it is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens , where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves .    69.97868162556998
this is what the commission will be judged on .    5.367581808282502
the salvation of european democracies is with nation states . europe ' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of europe .    93.67550932313465
president prodi , today you have presented the commission ' s five - year programme , and it has many objectives that we endorse .    61.501414849994205
my reply would be : a new start , a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the union in the UNK will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously .    154.06788044770707
madam president , mr prodi , we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which europe must overcome .    43.1253806458479
you say that you will not hesitate to come to this house to request more resources for the commission , but the commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice .    47.00671277653839
the union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient .    68.77820707929372
that makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view .    30.487259768383677
without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy .    158.83224365117297
the same applies to european air traffic control .    18.187880865150035
economic and social cohesion in the eu is a fundamental task of this community .    32.364144868136194
i hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing agenda 2000 .    129.0577087680645
the union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful european economy being in place .    34.86491394907806
the single market extending across that enlarged union is going to be a colossal achievement .    143.4824995989648
i conclude by saying , on behalf of all my conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this parliament - that we pledge our full support to the commission and to mr prodi in achieving this historic task .    81.23526399087027
we here in parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme .    57.96356272473368
we debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the commission , even where it is merely submitting a paper .    241.84353652038646
it is really surprising that the commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years , in view of the reform which must take place in 2002 .    85.32537485363551
in fact , the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions , such as the european parliament , which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy .    65.2441050914193
the commission gives no soul to europe .    17.754422267122756
we wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of vice - president , mr kinnock , on behalf of the commission .    59.16781879782391
madam president , mr president of the commission , i have read and re - read the commission ' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office .    39.24320834191884
are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved ?    274.78130876939895
this is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services .    44.53356209031108
the fisheries policy is due for review in a few months ' time , i . e . at the beginning of the year 2000 .    23.439994962961688
one area that i want to focus on , in addition to those already identified , is that of cultural diversity in europe .    46.04840998556267
if we are to ensure that we defeat the fear - UNK amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other , both within the present european union and among those who seek to join us and , indeed , among those in other parts of europe and the world who want to come and live and work in europe .    127.9688069411498
if we do not take steps to deal with that , we will fail ultimately .    43.46026443800927
welcome    3.8945224584361564
without them we would not be able to function .    18.29566407750296
if there are such rules , who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility ?    133.948934302798
mr president , i would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants , which we have always considered to be a priority , and inform you that - as the italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader , mr barón crespo , we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the quaestors .    115.7601033418783
we shall now proceed to the vote . 1    14.426795062846908
for similar reasons , we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which , with the oral amendment , dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity , since political rights , not just voting in local elections , but political rights in general terms , form part of the sovereignty of member states .    125.89700994628006
this is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap .    113.13023263261313
this cip has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic , social and environmental sectors .    65.72523775118351
the chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low .    38.59050312096175
faced with these social challenges , the effectiveness of the structural funds is still in doubt .    63.41061949570186
the answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted .    96.61595330166007
i hope everyone , like mr decourrière , whom i congratulate , will realise this !    80.06299504557471
this is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the eu which is at stake .    28.873799437531734
we therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of europe to be defined .    75.77107869143187
as a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world , of which the eu is just one proof , and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our western values , competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades .    105.94376372921647
for our part , we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes .    21.032785076431463
food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions .    70.73568229680095
secondly , it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically - modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation , as the rapporteur has said .    78.99555082234399
the amendment which the commission has proposed , namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 december 1987 , is UNK and has our full support .    65.4066699724171
also , amendments nos 4 and 5 to the new article UNK must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such , thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions .    100.04410837441048
genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end - consumer to choose food without gmo components or based on gmo components and to guarantee this .    228.3448735171546
the consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision .    49.20484085402599
gmos are the new challenge facing us .    28.34182658985813
but when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category , an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable UNK in UNK using such tests can provide useful UNK in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and , basically , where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis .    173.74632248761387
it is therefore hardly surprising that i and mr böge are talking about it and that mr graefe zu baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report .    58.92838202013507
as there is no vaccination , farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie .    84.02455314982798
on behalf of the european liberal democrats , we can support the commission ' s proposal on mr böge ' s report , but in the forthcoming debate on mrs roth - behrendt ' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where tses do not occur .    31.9476287320026
finally , i would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions , speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation .    127.98308575556877
when talking about climate change , we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere .    148.57335890954874
europe must therefore lead by example to some extent , both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters , including its groundwater , surface waters and seas .    201.68276356321863
for despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection , when we look at the state of the environment in europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved .    62.63521387066186
it is also clear that if we do nothing , our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner .    31.484156314174253
do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples ?    113.28783219592648
however , in spain and the other southern countries , which have an unusual climate , the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures .    93.65509443620437
this UNK is partly reflected in the common position which came about under british socialist presidency .    83.07409742813228
fifthly , the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear .    93.59546883674385
however , some people in our political group think otherwise .    16.598017288360523
we need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other .    55.822708485305576
the netherlands is located downstream , in a delta , which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance .    70.84722193224474
however , i have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation .    32.976368815619125
it is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth .    51.63084702627987
i know that this directive may have problems , given the differing situations of the various countries of the union , as has already been mentioned .    21.295833643823734
as an irish member of the european parliament , coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water , i support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive .    46.14429999490078
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the treaty of amsterdam seriously , then our long - term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption .    60.06289579183485
adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the eu if concentrations of , for example , UNK and UNK could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for UNK in the aquatic environment .    107.61921647915543
the common position is in this respect a farce , a document with no strings attached and a true UNK in the light of the ospar agreements .    65.75760235586469
mr UNK , my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise .    53.49160491984674
do you believe that these proposals , or proposals of this type , form part of the mandate of the igc as defined in helsinki ?    104.13637405714094
i do not think so .    2.3808797290964994
everything which can be done will be useful . i am sure that you and i , mr berthu , can at least agree on this .    82.03569898771865
however , the commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of unmik for this project .    36.69069888697004
so what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under - investment .    87.86283244556563
so i know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and i can assure the honourable member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in kosovo , whatever ethnic group they come from .    114.6384811975606
will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because , in the final analysis , we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the european union ?    72.24657540923948
what are the commission ' s views on incorporating the charter into the treaty on european union ?    2.9284219436083756
many elements of our work , and particularly of my work as commissioner for justice and home affairs , involve protecting the rights of children .    58.96727033401506
i would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary .    18.360700515109727
it is clear that in a process such as this , where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in europe , there is an on - going dialogue between the different parties concerned .    71.28297535322072
in 1988 , the commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men .    55.1108317968138
with respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality , as you know , this principle is included in the treaty of amsterdam .    27.48212805275161
in order for all policies to be similarly UNK by the concept of equality , it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required .    180.34079338085147
in the action plan prepared by my directorate - general , issues of equality play a very important role .    65.15809395768461
if we are to be able to motivate everybody , i believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or , if you prefer , from the bottom up .    99.00257844355004
subject : the boyne estuary and the drogheda port company the boyne estuary is designated a special protection area ( spa ) under the wild birds directive and is under consideration for designation as a special area of conservation under the habitats directive , as it is an area of international importance .    6.804648175127968
the most serious harm caused by the project , the damage to the stegrennan mudflats , was only to be temporary , and the UNK were liable for completely restoring the mudflats .    181.92438046341604
i would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation .    44.16443532446011
if not , why not ?    2.9067598508330144
if you are , when exactly are you going to do it ?    25.258934265799702
the first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place .    118.30581563941271
the involvement of regional and local authorities in the community ' s action is , as you know , one of the essential elements of the new post - berlin structural funds regulation .    23.521115690049307
i cannot show you the television programmes here but i can show you the greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections .    38.60104691928503
there are only a few weeks to go before the elections .    8.19747385224975
will the commission remain silent ?    46.78329904646155
will it bring it up with the greek government or will we persist with the UNK situation we had with the previous commission ?    148.52910902472763
this is about 6 % of the whole community contribution .    43.38907530846656
commissioner , thank you for your answer . however , i asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled ' international UNK experimental UNK ' .    83.97518545040019
- i am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content .    35.112740206281565
is that really authorised ?    35.32144967786061
this question is very important and i would like to know - since this is a kind of ' baby fraud ' - whether the commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the andalusians , so that the funds which the european union are going to pay to andalusia , based on the census , will take into account these 400 000 children which aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services .    120.44375766131978
unfortunately , a number of deadlines have been exceeded .    43.77236035605033
we want to guarantee that swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market , just like other citizens of the european union .    28.669914718688663
i also discussed this matter with the swedish parliamentary finance committee last week .    74.75814754085299
this may , of course , be seen as an issue concerning the internal market , but also as a public health matter for the whole eu .    28.68602041536788
my question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate UNK of good quality alcohol such as UNK wine or bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the swedish budget .    228.2304680603185
the commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products .    91.93434946643315
since the time allotted to questions to the commission has elapsed , questions 55 to UNK will be replied to in writing .    10.21291762853697
i understand that mrs wallström , whose presence here tonight i appreciate , is going to visit the area .    86.4817551263807
in no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution .    70.50756964804177
its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems .    25.876560056512513
we share them with everyone on this earth .    21.883492286475164
mrs schleicher UNK earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal .    56.8071027835882
but the key issue is , in my opinion , planning how to restore water tables , the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes , which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind .    71.63636030062453
in that spirit , we support amendment no 107 by mr marset campos .    110.5425073086326
the second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely ; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in romania must feature in today ' s discussions and also more generally when we UNK the environmental dimension of union enlargement .    92.32900333700994
mr president , commissioner , we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading .    14.67793396826536
mr president , through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the european union .    53.935124726578636
the whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the eu .    13.669115778439632
is the commissioner aware that our country has one of the UNK systems of transfers in europe ?    31.475201193610005
they already existed in ancient times : they had them in roman times , although on a smaller scale .    79.9181354699495
we have not considered it necessary for the commission to regulate the very limited UNK of water for whisky production .    86.98064394834381
we must , however , keep to their precise scope and content .    30.72039438442009
the commission can also , in principle , approve amendment no 60 , according to which a timetable is required for implementing the commission ' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances .    43.83912620466322
i therefore support the overall thrust of amendment no 105 , which is in line with the commission ' s original proposal .    18.0842180492758
the most important parts of parliament ' s amendments nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle .    28.239159997745034
finally , i want to say that i welcome the efforts which parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the council takes other views .    55.70602737997935
i would stress the life - nature strand in particular .    24.80219404282147
i think parliament often protests about this method , not to point the finger at any specific party within the council , and i certainly would not want the portuguese presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs , since , the truth is , it is something of a tradition , which the council has kept going for a long time .    84.61066923075929
secondly , life is an instrument that has already produced good results , and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation .    119.07736661148506
we therefore feel it is crucial that as amendments nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which life - environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water , as well as for reducing greenhouse gases , they should be adopted .    75.62925400135649
that explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions , ambitions for which , of course , there is a price .    36.032743556380126
we therefore support mrs lienemann ' s amendment which observes that the allocation for life was not increased when the union was last enlarged , without even mentioning the next UNK of new UNK .    92.24367896501944
secondly , to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of life funds , in order to rule our any suspicions of UNK or UNK .    99.29850463777984
however , i would like to insist on certain points .    3.198689114730611
on the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years , an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument .    85.43698482757297
unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection , there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years , and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies .    64.53180928884602
at this stage , the commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position .    18.866135789113507
modernising social protection    240.44108877381336
equality has no pillar of its own .    29.736929868898354
this is something we have borne in mind .    16.557000278724516
we are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect , for example , that there should be a transition to UNK social security systems ; that UNK leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems ; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life ; and that the basic old - age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living .    100.80397463064313
but it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion .    20.723914536909316
the issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the european union are quite different from one another .    69.94246296503594
the financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this , and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the european agenda , and why , in fact , scenarios such as UNK UNK ' UNK member state or the european social snake have scarcely got off the ground .    113.33004919194325
but this new course of action is very exciting .    30.91060184278872
the success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support .    31.930664136282942
mr president , i would , in turn , like to congratulate both the commission , for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security , and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled .    46.98631067585779
the european union ' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy .    21.96365513123026
but under the influence of the free movement of employees , of the internal market and of the euro , the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated .    54.36407082218555
mr president , as others have done , i should also like to congratulate mr andersson for the report he has produced .    8.162143480070952
this is not an option for us any more .    22.690394231151064
the structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot , therefore , be UNK through budget deficits and trade .    57.89204652626565
mr president , i have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection , which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of europe .    31.21915697621421
the second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the european commission can operate .    22.476731214534162
the debate is closed .    1.77856952007382
in my own country , sweden , one of our biggest export industries is affected , namely the music and sound recording industry .    60.360601929745336
she has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the world intellectual property organisation ' s treaties .    148.48599808758453
as regards the first of these , it seems to provide an effective solution for the long - standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works , while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution , rental and the presentation of their works to the public .    141.69149756841168
mr president , i should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which , nonetheless , concludes that , as a community , our accession to these two wipo treaties must not UNK down to a mere institutional development , however important that may be , i . e . the opportunity for the european community and the wipo assembly to work together .    90.0093406988728
this ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of europe .    49.42785731313705
i am not now speaking of charlotte cederschiöld ' s recommendation , which is an excellent paper , but of the matters of copyright that the previous parliament discussed .    123.95555016258504
both treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters , but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks .    108.73622497249406
the two treaties explicitly permit the community to become a party to the treaties and to play an important role in managing them .    94.35326435190261
mr president , i see in the minutes that two members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to strasbourg on monday .    42.904689332737085
we were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival .    39.874928109548236
the smell is absolutely UNK !    53.03298574494197
today about eur 9 . 5 billion of previous edf resources are UNK .    51.03770581085813
to focus on the input coming from the evaluations , i would mention the following problems : the objections of community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence .    186.13095354922456
no single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes , ranging from macro - economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross - cutting themes such as gender , environment , good governance and institutional reforms .    274.11073384344894
this should be done at member state level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for community action .    49.04162166745643
this is the topic .    7.098283393633757
at the same time , we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid .    12.067413818660363
we should not make reality out to be more rose - UNK than it really is .    47.76631335897917
it is only natural that we in parliament guard the interests of our citizens , but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable , international environment , in which the goal of human safety is pursued .    85.16572391289662
the crisis in last year ' s commission has been solved today , but the commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach , which , no doubt , the entire parliament will soon demand in the resolution .    109.49617460261733
why will neither the council nor the commission admit the fact ?    126.80651497684575
let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the intergovernmental conference , the reform of the commission - which will also affect the development services - , this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement , to perfect a more coherent political union .    107.309401488595
we therefore hope that the commission , in the report it is going to present to us on global policy , will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of community resources and the specific management of public interests .    126.09676355246958
this is not new .    3.7344216979433082
this monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction .    118.85353682764834
in the stance that we took at seattle , why such a silence on the eu ' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the gatt , including for the crucial UNK sector ?    148.1827449293042
i also want to take up the subject of migration .    11.523862662097585
there is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the member states and there are some projects being carried out by the member states and the european union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another .    42.67662795746167
in our view , cooperation is , and should remain , an intergovernmental exercise .    42.07136676213173
i believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the european union ' s role in international development policies is significant .    29.779118869085227
i have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything .    68.15950479499969
i think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist , and we certainly do have them .    71.6265820929293
the major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on , and this is the problem .    31.33471572945317
we should not be too masochistic .    20.08652993420277
i want to address this issue directly because we in europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously .    89.85355752541001
as the presidency has noted , the union as a whole is considering its position .    31.49074020311593
what i hope is , first , that we in europe will adopt a common position and stick to it , that we will not allow some to be UNK off , that our position will not be based on self - UNK or UNK , that it will be a common position and a sensible position .    103.80862123986245
the commission can also accept amendment no 4 in principle .    11.797143071359255
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )    1.8596160652932523
i can speak for my party , which championed austria ' s membership of the european union in the early days .    99.72717234626653
( loud applause )    2.358241412739238
the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection has proposed many amendments which have , for the most part , been retained in the common position adopted by the council .    13.599211255158979
we have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the socialist group .    55.86723058513814
the socialist group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been .    51.82784790075541
this is why we are abstaining .    25.405948944881462
this means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated .    122.84348042491146
the commission did not do that .    12.319840528801107
we cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts , such as the mediterranean countries , and countries with northern levels of rainfall .    115.87988109238053
the committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020 , the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020 .    86.39827682861349
now , the concept of " uniform harmonisation " is one of those muddled expressions which totally UNK the integration process in question . it is also true , as it states in the explanatory statement , that harmonisation could be damaging as " it might place greater demands on weaker member states at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security .    70.47497228492256
) mr president , i voted for the council ' s strategy for modernising social protection because , in my view , it constitutes a step towards the establishment of european social and pensions legislation , although it does not actually go the whole way .    36.89708941406024
i was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote , since i believe that , in essence , the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly , despite the fact that , as we all know , the governments of the 15 member states would like to reduce pensions to the minimum .    109.51892094490248
the elderly are waiting for the european parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now .    49.888843913503614
in particular , we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the commission ' s becoming involved in telling the member states what to do ( see , for example , paragraph 7 ) .    161.4902380200246
as swedish liberals , we see european integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross - border problems such as the environment , trade , movement across borders , human rights and conflict management .    141.8123599899526
that is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the european union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see .    54.86396945888861
that concludes the explanations of vote .    39.212730620572465
we have often employed instruments which , at the formal level , make us feel comfortable , but which , in terms of practical results , are totally ineffectual .    91.48800129829917
as you know , on monday an UNK UNK went into UNK around a UNK - shaped asteroid called UNK which is not very far from earth .    131.67234815454722
human rights , which the eu embraces , are thus under threat , but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated .    138.46218774256155
thirdly : it will need to be made clear for each of the eu institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the european union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails .    82.77447097529208
both in UNK and kosovo , the un , despite the many warnings , appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres , as president havel pointed out this afternoon .    189.93234959266033
we should be grateful that there are heads of state like vaclav havel in our europe .    98.38650718351094
in so doing , we would not only UNK the united states into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to un funding , but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric .    123.63688946044974
mr president , this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual un human rights convention and the commission ' s and council ' s efforts in this respect .    69.9841594611255
she will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in china .    68.01588776899573
there is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy .    46.51288775045124
the council statement on the position of the european union on developments concerning cyprus ;    36.32520453539191
i cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently , nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies .    53.877552682906355
the declarations made on the cyprus question by the council and the commission were therefore most opportune and i should like to thank the president of the council and commissioner verheugen .    36.48762893858959
we must therefore welcome the fact that the helsinki european council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions , and i quote , that " if no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations , the council ' s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition " .    76.94462773306083
with regard to the amount which is quoted in the brok report ( eur 130 million ) , i also want to say , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money .    41.212868315665474
the most important thing is that a multi - annual programme be guaranteed , and in the correct category , so that it might be possible to begin making plans where cyprus and malta are concerned .    67.62367568037646
in my view , it is the task of the european union to employ all instruments , including this one , so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means .    57.77111934103007
encouraging turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the un secretary general .    210.75973648806382
from that standpoint , UNK ' s island , as cyprus is known , and the pirates ' island , as we UNK say of malta with great UNK , are two jewels which should be welcomed into the european union without delay .    128.01651289655655
i must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation , the one that has yet to be decided on here , before we can even get started .    63.57033790408248
. ( de ) mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , now that the commissioner has explained to us , in an extremely coherent manner , that the erstwhile president - in - office of the council and his minister of state for europe UNK responsibility for the lack of coherence , perhaps you could help the commissioner and ourselves , so as to enable us to take this decision .    37.65676594179811
forgive me mr poos .    140.41839420160102
there was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me .    26.269523312355464
question time ( council )    2.810827279317035
at that time , bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident , the council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it .    38.79950740697565
yet , the sum of eur 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999 , was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even UNK civilised conditions in kosovo , especially where the provision of health services is concerned .    150.082762640297
this objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the general affairs council in luxembourg on 8 april .    87.19795123938675
this is a responsibility that the european union takes very seriously , mr posselt , and i would like to mention that , at the general affairs council held on monday , this issue was repeatedly stressed when we were discussing kosovo .    62.259923839483044
this is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter - ethnic coordination , and we are all conscious that , if measures are not taken in the short term , we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago , and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of kosovo .    168.27917122496086
in my opinion , the best thing the council could do would be to cease occupying that part of yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides , with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non - intervention in the internal affairs of another , independent country .    100.84559104595225
i respect your understanding and knowledge of the balkan region , mr alyssandrakis , but i find it difficult , quite frankly , to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can , in terms of political stability , be a solution to the problem .    103.33152060033385
if we look at the democratic stability of the region , it could perhaps be said that it was the break - up of yugoslavia that caused the current situation , but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development .    85.0667377120597
it is very important , if we stress that europe is to be a europe of values , that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends .    71.2874851335061
mr rübig , as president - in - office , i cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the portuguese prime minister on behalf of the fourteen heads of state and government of the member states of the european union was adopted UNK and not by him in his capacity as president - in - office of the council of the european union .    20.89371102381653
will the council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands , or will the council feel free to amend that document ?    136.99565615489365
how do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education , health care etc - but , at the same time , did not pay any tax and did not contribute ?    130.5992814610536
. mr president , i have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy .    14.702318699956125
mr president in office , ladies and gentlemen , i have great honour in extending a warm welcome , on behalf of the house , to the president of the czech republic , mr vaclav havel .    38.65748113862928
an association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the european parliament and the czech parliament .    45.70597629307546
reconciliation with your neighbours was , and still is , a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance .    276.23281458666736
the european union , for its part , will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement .    26.745096225839063
the next step , i . e . institutional reform , will be taken following the inauguration of the new intergovernmental conference , in which the european parliament will be fully involved .    60.81378202862242
thank you , mr president .    2.6819809958214464
, rapporteur . - mr president , i had hoped to be rising at 9 a . m . , not 9 p . m . , to present this report .    36.46217615399021
the two assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the lomé convention and i look forward to the signature of a new convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned .    116.24985256505943
i am quite sure that mrs kinnock ' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations .    94.83448199840595
when mr dalmau , the cuban UNK minister for foreign affairs addressed the assembly , he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known .    141.4270692855787
i am delighted to see the result in zimbabwe .    18.481005320036175
the lomé convention is a unique partnership ; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of lomé and involve a participation of the wto and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora .    184.82166268428924
i protest against an UNK and UNK organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a UNK death to enrich a minority .    161.15477025238138
we must put the people of the acp countries first in our relationship with their rulers , who need to be fully aware that development aid from the european union is intended for the people and not for the UNK that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries .    68.60043409466905
cuba ' s wish to join is welcome and cuba will be welcome in our circle .    79.91778719241057
in spite of the fact that , both in the treaty and at the un ' s meetings in rio and copenhagen , there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world , the budget for development aid is , in actual fact , being cut back , when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen .    86.25603662195095
my second question concerns the fact that , in many contexts , we talk about the acp countries having to learn the principles of democracy .    55.721897930308685
i think that is a very good idea indeed , and i fully subscribe to it .    42.9943263090016
however , we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements .    20.54862208627081
in contrast to how things are done here in the european parliament and in parliament ' s committees , where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports , there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the joint assembly . the two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves .    104.33464566550754
this would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted amsterdam treaty .    62.62835742549857
fyrom wants to be told here and now that , in principle , accession will be possible when the time is right .    145.5139986480149
the former president , mr UNK , can take special credit for this , and the current president too has already adopted the profile of president of all macedonian citizens , so much so that the european union should only be grateful to have him as UNK in the balkans .    76.86217188176877
if certain countries wish to use the words " former yugoslavia " , then that is their business ; others need not feel obliged to copy them .    132.9310059354485
i conclude , mr president , by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult , fragile , and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated .    141.14798135097354
if we mess it up , then we will have lost a great deal more .    54.631239136962535
mr president , commissioner , i am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow members .    16.058314970571722
this is a country that has difficult inter - ethnic problems to deal with at home , and is resolving them with increasing success .    103.5394258949858
what else can we do to support this opposition ?    93.52108437031463
mr president , commissioner , one of the most basic aims of the european union ' s stability and association agreement with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area , and this , of course , presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved .    29.974025308951
we are now making in the commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in march .    49.34561644862881
i hope that the other countries of the region will UNK their efforts to make similar progress .    32.66276661743588
firstly , the whole system is obscure .    21.73315588692857
there is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point , highlighted by mrs frassoni , given that we now have an automatic information system .    31.23166238476509
protocol on the excessive deficit procedure    51.69311536264933
mr president , i am also pleased to welcome the spanish commissioner , mr solbes mira , whom i have congratulated more than once , inside and outside this parliament , on the excellent work he did in spain on the subject of european convergence .    74.55693830783297
secondly , for economic and monetary union .    6.495028722245717
it is good that the procedure exists .    15.10572010146715
this is why this report is also so politically charged : a report , by the way , on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly .    51.44239444973453
that being so , i believe the final result will be better .    55.81211261030327
the whole of the union must have the same protection , a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting , not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation .    114.21901126976205
trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences .    166.9792514497074
thank you for listening .    21.947496572385262
due to its importance on a world scale , the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery .    118.30569876925674
so we come back to the previous problem .    32.655457713580326
in other words , the council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis .    28.8691033935355
after all , it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting .    28.66793526255365
the definitions ' standardised futures contracts ' and ' standardised options ' should therefore be combined to form a new definition , ' financial derivative instruments ' , which also covers otc derivatives .    200.02206930519458
i believe that today ' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors .    71.86817473075006
the capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses .    39.64468494969395
the legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses .    90.58131841832875
heavy - UNK - a UNK of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers .    195.73582669940927
but i appeal to this house to take a balanced and common - sense approach on this issue .    54.30886247195183
i share some of the concerns expressed here , especially by mr garcía - margallo y marfil , but this face - lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index , and which are therefore managed either UNK or not at all , and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively - managed fund were treated in the same way , if only to allow medium - sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market .    133.24918115766974
i therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and i think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund ' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile .    81.95117501210582
mr president , commissioner , the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions .    52.813692017259484
amendment no 8 because the proposed , general reference to assets ' covered by this directive ' , instead of the more precise reference to assets ' mentioned in article 19 of this directive ' , hinders implementation .    145.02947618060134
i believe that otc instruments could lead to problems , because they are not UNK , the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks .    92.64740246141979
for example , a management company might be doing UNK business and , if not able to sell , it would put the securities in the fund it would manage , or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did UNK business .    178.98015498808155
as regards the question put by mr huhne , his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations .    76.6043394219217
in her question mrs kauppi asks why the commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals . the reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product , while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider , and on prospectuses for ucits .    173.37051987062293
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0019 / 2000 ) by mr di pietro on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms , and rights , justice and home affairs on the draft council act establishing the convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the member states of the european union .    4.343174109305012
some of these differences have already been UNK out , but others persist .    108.3152649894357
the amendments can be UNK as follows : they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence , introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible , and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications , an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various member states of the union .    138.01648677917953
crime in the european union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step - by - step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs .    153.67165207761235
finally , i would like to reiterate that mr di pietro has , in my opinion , delivered sterling work by submitting a report which , within the limitations , offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms .    53.595758769493116
my thoughts turn to what may become of this community , of these conventions and judicial relations if , for example , a fascist country such as turkey became a member of the union . it would truly UNK me .    125.89314836001518
mr president , i too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom , security and justice which europe will hopefully one day become .    46.738076530093075
it is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons , in which there are no frontiers to crime , but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime .    154.32269432270746
this , however , does not mean that the council can work on this anonymously .    35.36021767270277
the text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set - ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the maastricht and amsterdam treaties respectively .    77.36682992296886
the term ' legale esterno ' has been translated into french as ' avocat neutre ' . i have no idea what an ' avocat neutre ' is .    130.19612603946157
i just wanted to correct this .    7.954910531104891
i hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this .    38.66037704864584
report ( a5 - 0021 / 2000 ) by mrs frassoni , on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the agreement between the european parliament and the commission on procedures for implementing the new council decision of 28 june 1999 - ' comitology ' ( 1999 / 468 / ec )    6.499630014617652
we have before us malta and cyprus , which are two states keen to become members .    43.12626781701707
we must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years !    36.37672766450184
( fr ) the proposed action and programme presented by mr prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again .    80.72365082141621
in fact , the word seems to have been UNK from the commission ' s vocabulary , whereas liberal and american references UNK .    67.77395986249121
. the joint united nations programme on aids estimated that by the end of 1998 , there was a total of 33 . 4 million people in the world living with the hiv infection .    91.08446807133176
the effects of the aids pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub - saharan region is being UNK or reversed .    91.45862779201545
aids UNK that may cost $ 18 000 per annum for one person are obviously not affordable by countries whose annual health budget may be less than $ 5 per capita .    145.05965162440083
apart from reducing the volume of exports from these countries to the community market , what we term ' development aid ' to the acp has fallen constantly , from 70 % of total european union aid in 1986 to 30 % in 1998 .    234.53586713309565
we have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the european union .    23.143932299823224
we are also developing another suggestion of that expert group , the managing change report .    74.63624681189911
this partisan behaviour of our president should be criticised most firmly .    127.00427096200762
why should this be the case ?    13.84671302836695
but i did not hear a UNK when UNK and UNK were discussed , where , similarly , a great number of european employees were involved .    79.67442295897158
if these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted , my group will abstain from the final vote .    51.954926845701806
i , like all members present , am saddened by this loss of jobs .    38.76357932586698
but maybe next time , we ought to discuss UNK , the merger which has now taken place between our UNK UNK and british steel .    150.3609827114465
yet , all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies .    44.09864882393909
we need more joined - up policy making on these issues .    35.815937984722204
topical and urgent debate    3.7677800277461744
b5 - UNK / 2000 by mr gasòliba i böhm and mr sánchez garcía , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , on racist and xenophobic incidents in el ejido ( spain ) ;    5.896675916489669
they will take a long time , as we are finding out .    33.953100610718536
secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration .    57.296472207493586
mr president , last week , in the andalusian town of el ejido , we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the european union in the year 2000 .    33.215050302919046
in el ejido there is a serious social problem , problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the UNK .    109.29683923499607
what happened at el ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in europe today .    69.40108983155402
we wish to assure these moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough , they have to suffer this type of aggression .    140.71014894108967
but trying to take something positive from them , i hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance , fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the european union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it , not at some indefinite moment in the future , but here today .    252.86808932133385
the joint debate is closed .    2.89637005463938
i certainly appreciate the fact that commissioner patten is present , given his powers .    33.090293122711174
mr president , what is happening in mitrovica in kosovo is appalling and reprehensible .    38.55927070590018
by christmas , there were perhaps 100 and , by the spring , still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was , in fact , in place .    144.01328612165156
i believe that the european union must do likewise .    7.155447337917405
the embargo on serbia must be lifted and serbia must , in turn , release its political prisoners .    88.84718917465713
human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time , not only by unita , but also by the government itself .    76.69926469546503
it very much remains to be seen whether these new lands will be safe in terms of public health .    32.346661720269374
the area in UNK which is to be the new land for the dineh indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in us history .    93.9474570961733
today , the dineh indians are facing their final fight for their right to land , for their right to dignity and , above all , for their right to their way of life .    78.91461822992588
it is high time we respected the rights of the indians .    33.24581881745515
we have received reports from human rights organisations saying that russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - i am talking about old men and women - in grozny .    136.08550889655066
i do not understand why the power centres of europe are keeping quiet , letting things pass and , by working with the russians as if nothing were amiss , giving its support to the government which is waging this war .    179.28969021053985
i can only reiterate my appeal to the council and the commission to stick to the rules .    35.11548398199111
hence his disappearance of over one month .    53.90047667080124
nor is it a mere luxury .    27.80562120771075
nor do i think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial .    28.521487197214125
in october , a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by UNK men and not released until the UNK was paid .    116.43543629136707
this is what is at stake now in cambodia unless the leaders of the previous UNK regime are bought to justice .    55.62818811549579
it is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society .    20.260051719257334
we fully support the work of the un through UNK , given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in angola .    46.38366374519148
the commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law , democratic principles and human rights with cambodian authorities through the ec - cambodia cooperation agreement which entered into force on 1 november last year .    75.24122248883639
i visited doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture , fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised .    187.69761411367293
my group assumes that margot wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected : economic aid , support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning - up operation which is required .    137.7511279007973
it has affected the peoples of three countries - romania , hungary and yugoslavia .    52.42165308233849
it is the tisza , hungary ' s second river , perhaps its most beautiful and most UNK by its people , that has borne the UNK .    135.50525124676258
as with all such disasters it is the long - term consequences that are the most pernicious .    82.03796148011105
the polluter - pays principle is a cornerstone of european union environmental policy .    28.34754183434094
the incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of european civil protection , along the lines suggested by president prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two members today .    146.69069385467705
the swedish christian democrats would emphasise the value of the european union ' s and the european parliament ' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction .    85.0487456762968
the next item is the report ( UNK / 2000 ) by mr viceconte , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the communication from the commission : ' enhancing tourism ' s potential for employment - follow - up to the conclusions and recommendations of the high level group on tourism and employment ' [ com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cos ) ] .    7.306016856577803
here , then , i want to point out that international competition is tough and , if we are to overcome it positively , we must together UNK and share a long - term strategy .    58.788910196155086
the introduction of these new technologies is not a threat , but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offers the potential to provide new and innovative tourism products and services , which our tourism needs for an ever - UNK tourism season , so that it can attract new customers and offer new and alternative forms of tourism .    153.07821395376286
mr president , i too believe that tourism has a very important role to play , not just in our european regions , but throughout the world , because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development .    34.397366629252375
i know the commissioner is very keen on information technology .    26.420317204839268
every year , nearly 200 million europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel , usually to other countries in europe .    87.16405149250045
mr president , commissioner , first of all i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr viceconte , who spoke at such length on the tangible possibility , for the fifteen member states of the union , of creating jobs by way of a sensible policy , a sensible european union initiative in this field .    31.663198659121065
certainly the commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies .    53.62272919302224
in the autumn the commission will report back on the progress made in this respect .    23.7323724908612
mr president , yesterday ' s minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so - called ' strasbourg declaration " which intends to UNK the european parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that i am a nazi .    142.29456796828933
that would be more productive and i do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already UNK being cut again and again because of this kind of show - piece .    138.98508051077135
mr president , we should like to request that the last sentence of amendment no 2 which reads : ' also calls on the member states to promote tourism for the elderly ' be incorporated into paragraph 25 , which deals specifically with social tourism , after : ' tourism for organised social groups . ' .    99.31903341344365
we think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective .    49.48738517866058
the report UNK the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism .    9.92624843760537
i would be grateful if you would not interrupt other members .    15.657765854221811
commissioner monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties .    68.33898037196663
the commission must listen to it .    17.306248998468355
we do not have to adhere to a weight of over UNK when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of UNK to make it at all worthwhile .    118.16516042958145
in these circumstances , it is quite reasonable for this house to express concern today , asking an oral question which urges the commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen .    115.23832066627861
but who defines these tasks ?    37.16710749402268
on the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided .    61.1592852700372
so , the commission , in bringing forward their new proposals , must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services .    149.4036505198356
it will most certainly be necessary , we say , because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable , to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits .    89.8766160279018
if a rural post office UNK , usually with the only local shop attached , then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result .    102.64199458392758
they are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs .    71.9839941784232
the sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services .    52.48460639375075
the post office is democracy .    42.13070782988564
it has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road , sometimes served poorly by public transport , sometimes not at all .    81.63234409708959
the more remote the community , the greater the difference becomes .    90.17565802771514
it is commissioner bolkestein ' s intention to present such a proposal to the commission for adoption in the first half of this year .    24.012767160831253
on the availability of the studies , - a point raised by mr staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to parliament in september 1999 .    67.2025476572398
thank you very much , commissioner .    1.9993701188243511
the post office and , more generally , all public services must , on the other hand , recruit additional staff .    47.168773375521006
dismantling the postal service , the local communication service , would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens .    180.56385669470112
in my grandparents ' time , it took several days to travel from vitoria to UNK .    100.92795560588809
everyone can be what they want to be because , if ireland and britain are both in the european union , there is no point in killing each other for being irish or british .    109.67307498742112
on the contrary , we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the basque country is the UNK which separates those who kill , and those who support and express understanding for the latter , from the vast majority of the basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom .    65.8311531206778
we are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the basque country .    71.27357821462985
this is at the heart of the system , and it is this , the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources , which will enable the political sphere to assert its UNK and to take its responsibilities fully on board .    47.40036909658936
this will make the commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the commission .    70.53757804876527
we would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the commission staff , who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the commission .    68.45760915618753
the commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve .    70.21355303760029
if that does not meet with a positive response , the difficult issue of which of our lower - priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed , not just by the commission , but by this parliament and by the council too .    38.521282660681905
enlargement - that is enlargement of the union - is one of the key challenges in this context .    68.7329438462418
one of those obligations very clearly - and i am at one with mrs maes in this - is in the preparation for effective , smooth , calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current union .    137.0977269200141
will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the commission UNK such a procedure ?    257.06258739984116
i am also grateful , at the risk of being UNK , to mrs theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which , if she will allow me to say so , she played UNK to many of the changes which we are now contemplating .    136.46237489944798
inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring .    230.27426165186395
i would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current member states and by the union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the commission and officials and UNK in the member states have to deal with the realities , the complex realities of membership of the union and the single market , it will be difficult to see the joins .    106.772214598852
as far as excessive paper is concerned , the dilemma is UNK out by mrs morgan .    105.72204759968574
we shall certainly strive in order to do that and i think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent .    70.20115404469955
i will now move on to the second issue which i should like to discuss with you . we have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility .    46.30329003912415
i will set this out in five points .    31.328496964233484
this should be decided by a conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen member states .    109.60026423202999
we have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the portuguese presidency , which is clearly carrying out excellent work , and during the french presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions .    80.9575964285876
in this respect we are also working closely and positively with the commission .    24.093057547936148
i would just like to repeat what i said at the beginning .    4.134343605148105
i want to concentrate on kosovo .    11.487944591303336
they have now been replaced by robust danish , finnish and swedish troops .    46.432461451726724
that is the purpose of all this , and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with mr patten , for it is military , economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries .    50.61831395128322
we need a civilian task force in kosovo now to monitor what is happening , and to tell the military and the police what they must do , otherwise everything we did in bosnia and everything we did in kosovo will be UNK by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence .    122.13593709575714
from the beginning , he wanted this war in order to become president .    52.88097854455131
i believe that european defence should be scrutinised by the european parliament and by the national parliaments .    18.134706401554478
in the UNK mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of , at sintra , the fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is ' UNK ' called autonomous .    152.4979405030331
you say that you are against war , but as secretary - general of nato you started a war .    14.200665380523157
but these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions .    62.59747633727611
these opinions add substance to my question addressed to mr solana .    73.72963884594368
and finally , what do you most need at these next UNK ?    50.27388238828622
at long last , the european union UNK that it cannot afford to always give the americans the political and military initiative .    69.0980223660233
but the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence .    66.8875870394958
mr solana has confirmed our view that , in a UNK european union , nato will have the UNK hand .    81.36872744420695
i wonder , and here i do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow members , about the direction in which we are going .    124.20868353308892
you know the french UNK , ' nothing for nothing ' .    49.05248000727367
i acknowledge mr patten ' s efforts in this direction , but what a pity that the governments of the member states had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of nato .    133.41878317055296
and what can we say about the UNK UNK that is UNK down on russian and international journalists and with the UNK of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres ?    163.5422319953404
they are very UNK in their military forces , and unsuitable for this sort of warfare .    184.04351745400962
what is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing .    78.93635158462484
all those things come together .    29.156043915704597
we have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti - personnel landmines in ukraine , in moldova , the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks , the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks , the political consequences of dealing with those stocks .    149.62040762356722
that is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view .    34.13415867347625
the recent initiative by the finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision - making centres is extremely important .    28.450489443992325
i am optimistic that we shall succeed .    24.260692702348784
there must also be a clear and real will to allow more women , who are ready and able , to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision - making process .    51.56828046759665
moreover , i would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today .    34.53268896204623
just for the record , i would say that she might well also have mentioned denmark .    58.76676552388573
i should like to UNK some of the points the commissioner mentioned , notably the question of financial resources .    29.902882646145944
i agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems .    133.55957916156262
women are no homogenous collective .    33.138219771367815
women belong to different social classes .    53.06865595605887
according to the treaty of amsterdam , there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right , and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically .    98.7285271182759
may i just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and UNK with regard to the equal treatment of self - employed people , including assistant spouses .    110.23601568720836
women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under - represented in peace - keeping efforts , conflict resolution and reconstruction work .    100.80916277236004
this is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas .    19.46291296034548
i would suggest the following : where possible , apply it on a voluntary basis , where there is reluctance , impose it .    89.88088607012767
we have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors , education , work , culture .    95.65778560156839
because they have to face social obstacles . because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest .    105.02765268279282
on paper !    35.01785187475878
mr nielson will be happy to report back to parliament on the findings of his mission .    24.594072169454694
thirdly , we spent much of this afternoon in this chamber discussing conflict prevention , how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively .    140.47303414482602
we talked about the importance of the commission developing a series of headline goals for non - military actions related to crises and , if i may say so , if ever there was a case where that is relevant , it is the disaster which has UNK mozambique .    123.62320647862893
mr president , commissioner , mozambique is a young african country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy .    115.46654288157619
the current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying , as the commissioner has already said : around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees , waiting for a UNK to come and save them .    169.2261005982166
i would like to emphasise , however , that the eu and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing .    20.95559690682787
rebuilding infrastructure is crucial , because otherwise there can be no development . it is also time for some UNK countries to think about writing off or reducing mozambique ' s debts .    334.0946590968214
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there remains , however , one immediate problem : the need to provide help for all mozambicans who have been afflicted , many of whose lives are in danger , in their flooded villages , hoping that they will be UNK .    91.40429648647175
as has already been said , helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid . otherwise , apart from the tragedy created by the floods , the next tragedy will arise : that of a lack of aid to the people , who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods .    154.29705395461488
could i thank commissioner patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said , the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken UNK valley in mozambique are absolutely UNK .    127.09238362798034
something more robust than a call to surrender to the UNK of the market economy , something more decent than opposing UNK aims but denying them the means of their realisation .    133.81384005575626
this report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the usa is eur 500 and in the european union , on average , it is eur 1 600 .    88.00354626920749
even if he advocates sustainable growth , sustainability does not come into it .    69.18116125753725
promoting employment , however , is a long - winded affair and comes under structural policy .    62.11988722923307
what did mr katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report ?    61.69092215390602
it is as simple as that .    23.675507048627882
there is also no doubt that , throughout the debate this afternoon , we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies .    122.845018713391
our aim must therefore be to make this UNK of the economy long - lasting with strong growth and job creation .    58.09355602642023
it should be stressed that the amendment does not in any way require the commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes .    144.9169364179491
otherwise the purpose of collecting and UNK data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue .    129.6032050025011
instead of always following behind the united states , in seattle , in kosovo , in iraq , perhaps the europe of brussels could suggest , over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the north atlantic , in the pacific , over and above the regulation of tuna , cod or other things , that europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing , a kind of UNK bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between UNK , japanese , UNK , russians , europeans , and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity .    184.58758494510226
after years of the cfp for the mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid , regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy , with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation .    84.68240668194788
the current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be UNK whether affected by the disease or not .    85.12580970273982
your votes , colleagues , in favour of my report in full , as endorsed by the fisheries committee , will be a very important part of a wider isa control package based on the reality of scotland ' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others .    180.31679165566644
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr hudghton , also for this report .    10.32040292027351
i too would like to compliment mr hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development .    104.42761974957808
this is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming .    88.3322751280679
for the others , well , we would have time to see what would happen , according to local circumstances .    121.52828878940956
for many years the greens were calling for the bse issue to be addressed .    50.45168463471035
the commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms .    90.3038359455405
nor can it be done , if the proposal involves a threat to public health .    36.19243646286076
in no way , however , can diseased fish be used for human consumption .    50.4196035151781
in this context i am happy to partly accept amendment no 1 , taking into account , however , that scientific investigations are not done by the commission but that the commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the member states .    85.09759796686022
with regard to the environmental impact , it is a well - known phenomenon that while stocks have fallen during the last decades several reasons have been advanced to explain these reductions : pollution , over - fishing , changes in climate , etc . it cannot at present be excluded that isa has an impact on wild stock .    136.3487277108377
to fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow , not just for our fishermen and the people of europe but , more seriously , for humanity as a whole .    88.32713102749504
the revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time - limited challenge facing us . we must completely overhaul , modernise or , if you prefer , update this policy in its entirety .    80.31830997227006
this is an unwise policy .    22.082485725993777
the fishery sectors in europe face serious problems and i am a great supporter of the fishery sector .    83.2186674811021
the environment committee is generally pleased with the commission ' s communication and we are also pleased that the fisheries committee adopted all our amendments .    41.88341492405074
the un fish stocks agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard .    100.66161907196083
i regret to say that this report , due to its link with the environment , seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular UNK .    94.18829759808321
more specifically , with regard to fisheries management in the mediterranean , we are all aware that fishing in the mediterranean is not governed by provisions on tacs .    61.82023279989818
we also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and , what is more , concepts .    154.43663159902678
with regard to amendment no 6 , we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee . i am a little surprised that you in the group of the party of european socialists did not support it then .    53.7900865802223
our president told us yesterday that the commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments .    106.14493233465112
firstly , we must show the commission , the council and the member states that this house cannot and will not forget about this serious incident .    43.6712296576745
we hope to hear specific proposals from the commission , with plenty of action and no more regrets .    164.70007058950344
